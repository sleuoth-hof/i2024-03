        "Technical analysis remains a cornerstone of investment strategies in financial markets, especially in the volatile realms of stock and cryptocurrency trading. Among the various technical indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands out due to its effectiveness in gauging market momentum. Concurrently, pair trading strategies have gained prominence for their ability to mitigate risks through the correlation of two securities. This report aims to elucidate the integration of RSI and pair trading strategies into a web application, which seeks to enhance predictive accuracy in real-time market conditions. We will explore how these methodologies can be combined to create robust trading signals that are integral to the application’s functionality, thereby assisting traders in making informed decisions.\n",

        "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. It measures the speed and change of price movements, oscillating between zero and 100. Traditionally, RSI values over 70 indicate that a security is becoming overbought, while values under 30 suggest it is becoming oversold.\n"
