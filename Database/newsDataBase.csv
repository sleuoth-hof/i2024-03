However, the advances proved to be short-lived as both cryptos pared gains. Still, DOGE was up 6% and SHIB gained 1% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the mostly flat broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index.The action underscores the market-moving sway Musk possesses over memecoins, with many crypto enthusiasts speculating on the possibility of him being behind one of the largest dogecoin holders and potentially integrating the token into an X payment system.Kabosu, the face of dogecoin and several other meme tokens, died early Friday, her owner wrote in a blog post.

coindesk.com,The Untold Story Behind Beeple's Historic NFT Sale: 'Token Supremacy' Excerpt,https://www.coindesk.com//consensus-magazine/2024/05/24/the-untold-story-behind-beeples-historic-nft-sale-token-supremacy-excerpt/,2024-05-24 20:48,"Mike Winkelmann sank into the sofa as three cameras recorded his meltdown. The dueling identities that had once structured his life were coming into conflict as his fortunes increased by the second. Unseen crypto billionaires were bidding for his soul, or at least it felt that way. His entire artistic career was being auctioned as a compilation of five thousand digital artworks, packaged by the Christieï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s auctioneers as a single non-fungible token (NFT). The winner would receive this NFT as an online certificate of ownership, a deed to 14 years inside Winkelmannï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s mind. It was surreal watching his own coronation from the couch. The new crypto king was slack jawed as his net worth continued to rise by the millions on the computer screen, reckoning with the transformation of his art into an ultimate use-case for blockchain technology, bringing the metaverse into the mainstream. Two documentary crews captured his euphoric stupor, memorializing the tight choreogew York Times reporter writing about the art world's relationship to money, politics and technology, is the author of ""Token Supremacy: THE ART OF FINANCE, THE FINANCE OF ART, AND THE GREAT CRYPTO CRASH OF 2022,"" published by Penguin Random House.(Penguin Random House)The artist had become a multimillionaire at that moment. It was too much to bear, and suddenly he was bolting for the out door patio, away from the living room, where his family had gathered to celebrate his success. Winkelmann needed some air.Once upon a time, the promise of a divided life held some appeal. Mike owned a lucrative business turning digital graphics and animations into branded visuals for clients like Louis Vuitton, Apple and Justin Bieber. The money he earned from those productions allowed him to live in the McMansion suburbs outside of Charleston, South Carolina. He fit comfortably there into the patterns of home, work, and hobby. He was popular with the neighbors, a plucky midwestern transplant with a wide smile, a sailorï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s mouth, and a heart of gold. He would sometimes rant about politics, but otherwise focused on family, sitting pretty in a large home overlooking the palmetto trees. Mike understood the value, because his parents taught him midwestern manners and the importance of staying reserved in the middle-class Wisconsin village where he was born. So he kept his more libidinal thoughts inside a computer running so hot that it needed to be stored in the bathroom on a wood platform over the tub, near a jury-rigged industrial A/C unit that vented its heat into the attic.The computer expended its vast amounts of energy trying to contain Beeple, the internet crap monster responsible for Winkelmannï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s cult online following. He adopted the name in 2003, after a 1980s toy that looked like the abandoned love child of Sasquatch and Chewbacca, with light sensors that triggered its blinking nose and squeaky voice whenever its eyes were covered by a hand. Winkelmann had just graduated with a computer-science degree from Purdue University in Indiana, but he found programming ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½boring as sh*t.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The 22-year-old was more interested in shooting narrahe Beeple toy came to symbolize his fascination with the interplay of light and sound.In 2007, Beeple started a project that would eventually make him famous. The ""Everydays"" series began as a daily drawing habit of crude little doodles that seemed to betray his more corporate, Bill Gates appearance. The drawings were the crass products of a mind feeding on internet bile (racist caricatures, nude women, penis jokes, political satire) and tutored by magical realism (family portraits, animal studies, Jesus smoking cigarettes, Hillary Clinton wearing gold teeth). A year later, Beeple switched to Cinema4D, an animation software that allowed him to manipulate three-dimensional space. For the kid who spent hours at Toys ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Rï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Us playing a demo of Super Marioï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½64 on the new Nintendo console, it was a dream come true to create realistic worlds on a computer. But it wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t until around 2011 that he started fully utilizing the program to experiment with bright colors and blurry shapes with names like Synthetic Bubblegum Tittufux. Around the same time, Beeple started releasing music videos made with opular his creations had become only when, on a family vacation to Hong Kong, he saw one of his works projected outside a Hard Rock Cafe.A recognizable style finally emerged in 2017, when Beeple fully articulated his fascination with tech dystopias. Importing digital assets from other websites allowed him to createmore detailed scenes in only a couple hours. His imagination exploded with skyscrapers stacked atop cargo containers, Santa Claus clones brawling to the death, and cultists worshipping an original Macintosh computer. Celebrity sightings abound in these nihilistic tales of the future: Donald Trumpï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s head opens to reveal a burger brain; Mickey Mouse holds a machine gun; and Buzz Lightyear lactates in the park.See also: Beeple Sold Out. So What?All that chaos was contained in Winkelmannï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s computer, sitting on a desk with its cables running into the bathroom hotbox. His home office was largely undecorated, with beige carpeting, Walmart bookshelves, andand Fox News on mute throughout the day. He was neither the first artist to adopt lowbrow culture (Marcel Duchamp beat him there by nearly a century when he exhibited a signed urinal in 1917) nor the first to immerse himself in mass media (Andy Warhol and his silkscreens of Marilyn Monroe might like a word). What made Beeple special was his evangelism for digital art, his embodiment of the internetï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s tendency toward dark absurdism, and his eagerness to build an economy around it. He had already cultivated a network of nearly two million followers on Instagram, and artist friends were repeatedly bugging him to start releasing NFTs. Why not try something new?Beeple had everything to gain and nothing to lose. In late October 2020, days before the presidential election, he released three artworks on the NFT marketplace Nifty Gatewa""Politics Is Bullshit,"" featuring a diarrheic bull tattooed with an American flag with a Twitter bird perched upon its neck. The initial offer for this edition of 100 images was just $1.00 each.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½If you need extra convincing from some BS artistï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s notes wether you want to spend a dollar on this i will punch you in the god damn face,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Beeple wrote about the offering in the lowercase, typo-ridden idiom of internetspeak. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Smash the buy button ya jabroni.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Poof. All gone. Sold. The two other NFTs offered, including one from a video series called Crossroads, went for $66,666.66 each. Even with such a devilish price ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ decided upon with the whimsy of a speculative market willing to spend whatever ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Winkelmann could identify his salvation in the metaverse. The most he had ever made from his artworks was $100 for a small print. Now the artist saw a potential avenue with the release of CryptoKitty and CryptoPunk NFTs. Executives behind those products had predicted that digital art would find online buyers, and within the two-month period from November to January 2018, CryptoKitties made $52 million. Mack Flavelle, a founder of the CryptoKitties project, pointed out why: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not that much that people can do with cryptocurrency,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he told the New York Times reporter Scott Reyburn at the time. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We gave them something fun and useful to do with their Ethereum.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Winkelmannï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s success seemed to fulfill the prophecy that individual artists would benefit from the cryptoeconomy. But the business developers behind crypto companies were looking for the kind of legitimization that no amount of advertising could attain, and collectibles by themselves felt like little more than a bubble. They wanted the approval of legacy compani of postwar and contemporary art. The anachronism was supposed to convey the immediacy of the artworkï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s appeal, even if art historians were more skeptical about its authenticity; nevertheless, the auction house described Salvator Mundi as a genuine Leonardo da Vinci painting, and it sold for a record $450.3 million to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. The price overtook the previous benchmark, set by a Picasso painting in 2015, by almost triple. Gasps from the salesroom confirmed the event as peak spectacle, made even more ridiculous in the coming years, as Salvator Mundi remained locked inside the crown princeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s yacht; he refused to exhibit the painting publicly, allegedly because he feared that museums might downgrade the work as belonging to a Leonardo assistant instead of the master himself.Restructuring continued in 2020, as Christieï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s announced that it would merge its impressionist and modern and contemporary art departm,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Guillaume Cerutti, chief executive at the auction house, told reporters at the time.The decision came at a time when impressionist and modern sales were performing far below their postwar and contemporary competitors. Combining the departments would dump collectors into one pool, changing the dynamics of the market and pushing tastes toward the present. It suddenly seemed that the most expensive artworks had paint dripping off the canvas; the artists were oftentimes women and people of color, and they were in their 30s and 40s ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ shocking for an industry that had exclusively prized dead white men for the majority of its existence. Sales of art sold within three years of its creation date grew 1,000% over the past decade to almost $260 million.Ironically, the arrival of the ultra-contemporary market occurred around the same time that ""20th Century Evening Sale"" in October 2020 would be the remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex, nicknamed Stan, which ended up selling for $31.8 million, the most ever paid for a fossil at the time.Many employees were bitter about the changes; they rolled their eyes at the little anachronisms that had become headliners. It was a successful marketing gimmick by the bigwigs to grab attention in a moment when the pandemic economy seemed on the verge of daily collapse. Those who joined the auction house to nerd out on art history hated this new approach, but others, with a sense for business, thrived in the controlled chaos.See also: Robert Alice Made NFT History, Now He's Writing About Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I have always felt like I am living in the theater of the absurd,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Davis later confided in me. He relished the ridiculous nature of his industry. The auction world was a system of meaningless sales records, an illusion of competition that often boiled down to a handful of rich men who all knew one another compnoisseurship was dead. Provenance was a mirage. Dinosaur bones were being sold next to Rothko and Picasso paintings.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½All I know is that I know nothing,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Davis said, adding that the motto was actually a paraphrase of something Socrates once said and a lyric from a song called ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Knowledgeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ by the California punk band Operation Ivy.So, when the salesman considered all the strange circumstances surrounding him, auctioning an NFT sounded perfectly reasonable. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It will be fun and a little weird,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he predicted. The auction was less than two months away, and everyone supporting the NFT sale had something to prove. Meghan Doyle, a researcher, and Ryoma Ito, the chief marketing officer, started working around the clock, feeling pressure to create the ""Everydays"" to commemorate 14 years of working on the project.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Cool, but maybe not as epic as it should be,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Doyle said, declining the proposal.Winkelmann returned with a new idea. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I had hit this perfect milestone in this massive project,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he remembered. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½And I had just happened to hit 5,000 days of making art.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Instead of offeri""EVERYDAYS,"" a collage of all his work up to that date. (Christie's)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½He came back to us with a magnum opus,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Doyle said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½With that image in hand, we were able to rally the support that we needed to develop content around the piece and get advertisements in the newspaper. We had a complete story, a complete picture.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½However, Ito found the level of involvement from Christieï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s marketing department lacking. Understanding the stakes of this auction for his company, he started trying to make his own luck through outreach with private collectors ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½whales,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ as they are called in the crypto community. Vignesh Sundaresan was one of the first names on his list.In January, Sundaresan could be found on the virtual disco floor with a champagne glass floating about the head of his digital avatar. He was partying hard in the metave was operating under a mysterious persona named MetaKovan, which translates from his native Tamil language into ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½King of Meta.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Sundaresan was a serial entrepreneur in the crypto industry; he had gained his affinity for decentralized finance after a childhood in the Indian city of Chennai, where he dreamed of becoming the next Steve Jobs. He was born there in 1988, and came of age alongside the World Wide Web, which had been released the following year. Then there were a series of false starts, including the creation of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Bitcoin ATMs,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which enabled users to deposit physical cash and receive crypto, and a trading platform called Lendroid, which blew through its $48 million in funding within two years.In 2019, Sundaresan started investing heavily in digital properties, buying a digital representation of a diamond-studded Formula One car for an online racing game, NFT artworks and hundreds of acres in the digs his ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½exosuitï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ created for ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½building the metaverse.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½At the virtual party in January, Sundaresan, now 33, unveiled a fund called Metapurse for investing in NFTs. The 20 Beeple artworks that he had purchased were bundled into a single asset called B.20, which was then fractionalized into ten million tokens. Buyers of the tokens were told that this would denote ownership over the metaverseï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s first large-scale public art project.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We were inspired by the idea of not only being able to own historic artwork, like the Mona Lisa, but also being able to own the museum it was displayed in, and then sharing that ownership and experience with the public,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the company said in its newsletter. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Making money with art is fairly simple and not very imaginative. What we want to do is to decentralize and democratize art.ï¿½gtant, MetaKovan wanted to leverage NFTs as a financial instrument. He was exactly the kind of person who might want to send a message about the power of digital art by spending millions on an image.Gradually, Sundaresan was coaxed into the process. He had some initial worries about going through the Christieï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½know your customerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ process, an anti-money-laundering rule that ensures that companies keep records on the essential facts of their buyers and sellers. He expressed his reservations to Ito, fearing that he would be unmasked as MetaKovan because of the digital identity trail. But, eventually, he came to accept that this was a risk involved in doing business with an established auction house, even if the majority of bidders remain anonymous to the public unless they choose to reveal themselves. He was joined by his cofounder at Metapurse ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ another Indian crypto investor, Anand Venkateswaran ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½½gstieï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s, which had initially been slow to support the sale, finally kicked into action. Winkelmannï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s NFT idea had been rebranded into an event wi""Everydays: The First 5000 Days."" Doyle was receiving increasing numbers of emails from crypto collectors expressing their interest in placing a bid. The artwork had been published without a price range; instead, the auction house chose to write ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½estimate unknown,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a cheeky nod to the usual ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½inquire for estimateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ phrase implying that anyone needing to ask was too poor to buy.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Estimate unknown.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ That was the truth. Winkelmann had prepared himself for the NFT to sell for somewhere near $1 million. Ito had the same gut feeling. It wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t until a few days before the sale, as reporters started asking if they were prepared to sell for tens of millions, that the team realized something profound was about to happen.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Noah looked at me and said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We are about to throw a grenade on the art world,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ium fee be paid in dollars; however, sale organizers worried that such an arrangement would discourage crypto whales from participating in the auction.Success needed to be measured with the companyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s longterm goals for growth. Accepting cryptocurrency would invite scrutiny from the press, traditional collectors and government regulators; it could also be a financial risk, depending on the volatile prices of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). What ultimately became clear to decision makers was that nothing about this sale could be half-assed. Big money often requires big leaps of faith.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½A decision was made at the highest levels to take the whole thing in cryptocurrency,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Doyle said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The amount of cogs in the wheel for that to happen was truly mind-blowing.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The gamble worked, and the tidal waves of inquiries about the Beeple sale never stopped. Sundaresan had already confirmed his partius online bidding wars that the auction house had ever seen.On February 25, 2021, the auction began with a $100 opening bid. Within eight minutes, the price had reached $1 million.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I was shocked that our website could handle it,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Doyle said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I had never seen that happen.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The auction had already reached the threshold for bidders at which the prospective buyers needed to be cleared financially, often with letters of references from the crypto exchanges supporting their transactions. There were nearly two dozen hopeful buyers at that point, 18 of whom were entirely new to Christieï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s. Most were millennials.See also: What's Next for Beeple After Dizzying $69M NFT Sale?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It was a psychotic amount of bidding,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Davis thought as his phone started blowing up with messages.

coindesk.com,Audrey Tang: Learning From Taiwanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Digit,https://www.coindesk.com//consensus-magazine/2024/05/22/audrey-tang-learning-from-taiwans-digital-civic-experimentation/,2024-05-22 21:19,"A new political philosophy has entered the chat.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Plurality,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the title and central subject of a new book by Microsoftï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s internal economist Glen Weyl and Taiwanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s former (as of yesterday) Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang, is the idea that collaboration-enhancing technologies should be more widely embraced both by the public and state. Societies should learn to cherish a wider range of viewpoints, the authors argue, and one of the ways to foster that state of mind is through technologies ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ perhaps blockchains ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ that enable us to come together.The book is essentially a coda to Tangï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s career as a public servant as well as an outgrowth of Weylï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s previous techno-political theory meant to counter the malaise overtaking a world beset by wealth inequality and economic stagnation, laid out in ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½tour to speak about the theory of Plurality and educate politicians on Taiwanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s groundbreaking civic digital experiments.You may be asking yourself how it is that advocating for a diversity of opinions, healthy civic debate and technology is a novel political strategy. And youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d be right! But what sets Plurality apart is Tangï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s tangible experience running large scale, open-source, public, digital infrastructure projects like the g0v project (pronounced Gov Zero), which created open source and interactive alternatives of Taiwanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s government websites, and vTaiwan, which enabled citizens to petition for policies.In other words, there is praxis to Tang and Weylï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s theory ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a goal in action. Weyl has described Plurality as something similar to environmentalism; it only works if you do it. The dream is to get the whole world on-boarded onto this system, advancingith a number of co-authors, the book is freely available to all (here) and something they hope to add to over time.See also: Changemaker: Glen Weyl Puts His Radical Ideas Into Actionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Our project will be carried out in conjunction with Plurality research and implementation,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Tang and Weyl write in an announcement post. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We don't just need hackers and writers, we need designers, storytellers, marketers and distributors to work with us. Under no circumstances will Glen and Audrey receive any compensation or royalties for writing this book, in keeping with the legal code that accompanies their positions; revenue will only be used to support the community and philanthropic mission we hope to build.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½CoinDesk caught up with Tang (who by all accounts has had a fascinating life, which was detailed yesterday in a TIME profile and will soon be the subject of a documentary) to discuss the writing of the book, how to cocestor.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This interview has been edited for length and clarity.To start off with an easy one: What was it like writing a book with Glen Weyl?So the book actually started two years ago even before I was appointed as minister of digital affairs. So in a sense, it grew with the ministry. As you understand, our ministry got started when the unprovoked war on Kyiv happened, when people suddenly started to care about resilience. And so a lot of the ideas from the book, like IPFS, decentralization and Web3 for redundancy, suddenly became a topic of focus when our ministry first started a year and a half ago.I think it's both very practical that those cutting edge ideas get used in Taiwan, and also highly enjoyable in the sense that people care about Taiwan. But they may not know how a civic tech ecosystem functions or how the state can fund a lot of decentralized technology as public infrastructure in the same way it builds highways and bridges.There was a lot of mutual learning. I would alssult of co-writing this book, both Vitalik Buterin and Glen have become residents of Taiwan. They got gold cards, which we hand out for anyone who contributes for 8 years or more to open source or any of the internet commons.For people who would hear the gist of the book and assume that it's another form of technical libertarianism, could you describe exactly what you mean by ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½plurality?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Sure, so plurality means collaborative diversity, right? It means technology that fosters diversity. So in that sense, it is a little bit similar to the idea of decentralization where everybody can host their own systems. But there's another dimension of effective collaboration and coordination, which we loosely refer to as democracy but it's not about just voting. It is about a continuous form of democracy that allows, for example, AI facilitated deliberation between people holding very conflicting ideas to build bridges for people who were originally ideologically opposed.Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative ActionI would say this form of collaboration sounds a little bit technocratic, that diversity sounds a little bit libertarian, but it is a unique combination of the two ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ collaborative diversity ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ that sets plurality apart.So I liked the book. It was a love letter to Taiwan in some sense, but how would you best persuade governments outside of Taiwan to adopt these democratic experimentations?Well, first of all, I think we learn from a lot of other governments as well. Our reputation system came from Reykjavik, Iceland. Our participatory budget system came from Barcelona. And of course, we were inspired by the internet consultation in Brazil from more than 10 years ago. And so there's a long tradition of working with internet technologies, not for the government to govern the internet, but using internet technologies to improve the governance of government itself.What Taiwan can contribute here is tha, resilient defenses against polarization attacks, you know, information manipulation attacks, deep fakes, transnational fraud and pandemic misinformation ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ you name it. For example, we've managed to overcome the polarization tied to our January election, without people hating each other.That's partly thanks to participatory fact checking, where we set up a community with 1000s of contributors and music to spread the idea of super fact checking. So as you can see, in any jurisdiction where there are similar threats or a similar urgency for clarity, these ideas take hold and the grassroots community just grows from there.Just off of the idea of crowdsourcing truth. X has a version of it. Do you think these different programs are better run by the government or by private corporations?Yeah, I think that the greatest thing about Community Notes is that it really is open source. I remember Vitalik set up his own node to verify what x.com did was correct. So because it's open source, you er. Imagine, not just for x.com, but for anybody in the fedi-verse where you can conceivably you can build a Community Notes, including Threads and other things, and in a sense making this not just a jury duty of sorts, but rather making it a alternate entry point where the Committee Notes are the default for the various different social platforms.So to your question, I see it working as a bridging system across different social networks and that the state should fund it, of course, but not control it. This is in a sense like funding running water for civil discourse, because if there is no such layer, then polarization is the default for the current generation of the social web.Responding to some of the like blockchain critics, how can the blockchain world help devise protocols that look more plural pluralistic rather than plutocratic?I think a healthy ecosystem in the blockchain world is one that is not dominated by a single implementation, right? So of course Ethereum itself has multiple implementations and also on different layer 2 solutions. I have in mind, for example, the Polkadot system, which is a distinct ecosystem, building on a kind of common meta-protocol. We need to get people to better understand that crypto really follows a toolkit approach, like the fact that you can reuse most of the governance protocols and enjoy cross-chain coordination. I think this is something that we in traditional politics find it difficult to imagine.Of course, there are things like gold cards that give people residency across multiple jurisdictions that kind of approximate this, but it is still not as nimble or mobile as, for example, Gitcoin is as far as that can identify people across multiple social presences. These examples serve as a very important proof of concept. So that when new governments start looking at quadratic voting, project funding and all sorts of ways coordination could be more thorough, they can point to those already working on-chain examples and say, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½oh, let's just copy  research from scratch.So the Daily Beast wrote a piece saying that some of Taiwan's civil tech experimentations are seeing decreasing use.Yeah, they decreased during the pandemic. That is true.I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond because I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t think I saw a quote from you.I think it's up to the vTaiwan community to explain what happened during the pandemic and what happened after. If you want a quote, actually, because the Plurality book is co-written with them, you can just read their accountChapter 2-2, has a very comprehensive response, saying that, and I quote, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As a decentralized, citizen-led community, vTaiwan is also a living organism that naturally evolves and adapts as citizen volunteers participate in various ways. The communityï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s engagement experienced a downturn following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted face-to-face meetings and led to decreased participation. The platform faced challenndates for governmental responses, and its somewhat narrow focus. In response to these challenges, vTaiwanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s community has sought to find a new role between the public and the government and extend its outreach beyond the realm of Taiwanese regulation in recent years. A significant effort to revitalize vTaiwan was its collaboration with OpenAIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Democratic Input to AI project in 2023. Through partnerships with Chatham House and the organization of several physical and online deliberative events centered on the topic of AI ethics and localization, vTaiwan successfully integrated local perspectives into the global discourse on AI and technology governance.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Then the next paragraphs say that today a second, related platform, Join, averages about more than 11,000 unique daily visitors. So while the state e-petition platform enjoyed slightly increasing participation during the pandemic because of the ease of online voting, vTaiwanï¿½ï¿½enow they're on a bounce back.So in a sense, youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re saying there was a natural evolution of people moving to different platforms, like the shift from MySpace to Facebook?I think the good thing about g0v [pronounced Gov-Zero] is that every project is by definition open source and part of Creative Commons. And so for new generations who want to revitalize vTaiwan, they do not have to start from scratch.See also: Ethereum's New Radical: Glen Weyl Isn't Vitalik But He's Its Next Best HopeOf course, the vTaiwan community today is not the same community at launch in 2014. All of us who were part of the original thing are still around, but the people who are running it are like 10 years younger than us now. And so, to your question, I think it is not just a migration thing. It is also how each generation thinks about experimentation. The original use of vTaiwanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Polis was considered very cutting edge in 2015 because it was very new. But now, the government regularlyd in it, so itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a sign that Polis is no longer R&D ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ public servants feel comfortable using it. The state's role is to maintain the mature open source products and make sure it's part of the public civic infrastructure.Are you familiar with Nathan Schneider?I read his tweets.So he recently wrote a book about digital democracy, and has since begun researching what would happen if digital democracy was basically everywhere online. Like, if you had to vote on any number of decisions, wouldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t that be a nightmare?You refer to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Governable Spaces?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Exactly.We had some conversations, not with Nathan, but with people doing similar research. I think it all depends on how top down it is. For example, the Zero Summit (which is happening today and tomorrow) almost always uses Slido, the very thin way to crowdsource Q&As. But Slido was also acquired by Webex to be just one feature during the vider Discusses His New Book 'Governable Spaces'People being in the same Discord workspace is also this sort of governable space as part of their toolkit; they don't even need to think about it as digital democracy. But it actually increases the throughput of coordination and makes collaboration easier and in that setting. I don't think it's particularly dystopian, because it's literally just increasing the bandwidth and reducing latency of governance. We grow from that, like from four people to 400 people to 40,000 people and so on.I have a few slightly personal questions, you don't have to answer them. Are you an extropian?How would you define it? Like someone who wants to live indefinitely?Yeah, I guess so.Well, I have a very different relationship with longevity. I was born with a heart condition that for the first 12 years of my life, whenever I went to sleep it was a 50/50 chance that I would survive. I needed to get the surgery for the condition when I was 12. So I'm good now, but it shaped my personality. I always have this compulsion to publish before I perish every night. So I publish everything. So in a sense, I think it's also extropian.Do you think Taiwan should raise taxes?I mean, our taxes are so low by OECD standards. But we're doing pretty good with a very low tax rate. Last year, we even gave everyone $100, including young people, because we got more taxes than we anticipated from TSMC and so on.How long do you intend to stay in government office?So I'm stepping out on May 20.What are you doing next?I'm on a book tour. I'm going to go to Madrid and Paris for VivaTech. And I think to Croatia, for BlockSplit and also to Helsinki, Berlin ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I'm missing a few. So many different countries in a span of three to four weeks right after May 20.Do you hold cryptocurrencies?I did, back in 2010-11 I consulted for one bitcoin per hour. But when I became a public servant I quite explicitly got out. My consultation rates when I started, bitcoin was something like 100 U.S. dollars and the0 by this time I entered the cabinet in 2016. So it was still not very significant.Obviously, you are a strong advocate for open source everything. Do you think the same arguments hold true in the world of AI?Yeah, I mean, my mainframes started as computationally expensive. Open source still managed to thrive. But of course, during those times of the Free Software movement, open source started to thrive when personal computers started to get connected to the internet circa 1997. What I'm trying to get at is that I think the fundamental freedoms, like the freedom to use software for any purpose, is doubly true when it comes to machine learning and machine training models. If a foundation model cannot be governed by the people who use it, then essentially it's the people who train those foundation models, determining its worldview, perspectives and epistemic norms of the people using the model.So for example, in Taiwan, there is the National Science and Technology Council, which aligns the Lama3 models using local crowdsourced ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ what we call the alignment assembly, which is when peopleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s general preferences determine how it should behave ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ like with regards to the use of imaging celebrities in advertisements. It is a mini public microcosm of our population to determine the guide rails affected by it. The ability to steer AI is very important. And that openness to steering is the key whether you call it open source, or open weights or open access.Do you think the models will establish AGI?It only makes sense if you're like placing robots in place of people, because that's that's what AGI is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ it can do what people can do. But in the actual way we're using AI nowadays, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s more like assistive intelligence. The email replying modem doesn't send the email on my behalf, right? It just drafts emails on my behalf, using my style.All these uses increase our collective intelligence. And if the g years or century?Of course, of course. Depending on the ranking, we're either the most democratic country in all of Asia or the second: sometimes to Japan, sometimes to New Zealand. But we're certainly among the top and in terms of internet freedom. I think it is this combination that is very rare, because many jurisdictions think to allow for this amount of internet freedom, it will surely lead to polarization and decline of democracy. But Taiwan is living proof that you can have maximal internet and also a functional democracy without polarization.I really liked your phrase ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½humor over rumor.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ When is it appropriate to apply a strategy like that?I think some sort of humor, at least on a personal level, is always good. When I look at very trollish, toxic text, I automatically focus on the like three words out of 3,000 that can be construed as funny or informative. Through this lens, we can enjoy interacting with the parts that's actually enjoyable.I often rming. If you go to my Flickr, there's this whole album of me making memes like this, so whenever thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s some controversy at the ministry I can quickly respond with a mimetic picture as a very funny rebuttal. We call it pre-bunk. That is that you don't need to wait for information manipulation, polarization or conspiracy theories ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ you can make a funny scoreboard of people's preferences of AstraZeneca versus BNP versus Maderna if thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s controversy over the COVID vaccine.So you have a knack for a turn of phrase. Is there one expression that you choose to live by?Oh, yeah, I would like to be a good enough ancestor.Oh, that's a good one.I think good enough means that we don't over-design and foreclose the possibility of future generations. They're going to be much more creative, but it is our job to make sure that they have a larger canvas when they are born into the world compared to when I was born into the world.See also: Bitcoinenjamin Schiller."

Leeds Rhinos and Great Britain rugby league great Rob Burrow has died.. Burrow, who was 41, had lived with motor neurone disease (MND) since being diagnosed in late 2019.. The diagnosis came just two years after he retired from playing, following a stellar 17-year career that included winning eight Super League Grand Finals, three World Club Challenges and two Challenge Cups.. Burrow's death was announced by the Rhinos, who called their former scrum-half and hooker ""a true inspiration throughout his life whether that was on the rugby league field or during his battle with MND"".. The Prince of Wales said Burrow would be remembered as a ""legend"" with ""a huge heart"".. In 2022, Burrow was presented with the Helen Rollason Award at the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year ceremony, with his ex-Leeds team-mate Kevin Sinfield also recognised.. Burrow was given the award for relentless fundraising and raising awareness of MND while battling the illness himself.. Burrow spent his entire club career with Leeds and made more than 400 appearances between 2001 and 2017.. This video can not be played. Burrow honoured with Helen Rollason Award while Sinfield accepts special award. One of the most successful rugby league players in history, Burrow was made an MBE in the 2021 New Year Honours for his services to the sport and for his work in the MND community.. Burrow and his great friend Sinfield were both made CBEs in the 2024 New Year Honours. The pair have helped to raise more than ï¿½ï¿½15m for MND charities since Burrow's diagnosis.. Burrow struck a defiant tone on learning he had MN""The worst thing for me is people pitying me,"" he said. ""I know it's going to come, but I want to be as normal as ever.. ""While I am able-bodied and feel fit and strong and healthy, I want to do normal things and not be treated any differently."". Burrow and wife Lindsey, who married in 2006, had children Jackson, Maya and Macy together.. In announcing his death on Sunday, Leeds said of Burrow: ""He never allowed others to define what he could achieve and believed in his own ability to do more.. ""The outpouring of love and support that Rob and the whole Burrow family have received over the last four and a half years meant so much to Rob.. ""In particular, the rugby league family and MND community have rallied around Rob to inspire him, thank you for your support.. ""For those who knew Rob throughout his life, his determination and spirit in the face of MND over the last four and a half years came as no surprise.. ""Rob never accepted that he couldn't do something. He just found his way of doing it better than anyone else.. ""He will continue to inspire us all every day. In a world full of adversity. We must dare to dream."". Burrow a sporting great and inspirational MND campaigner. 'Beacon of hope' - Sinfield's tribute to friend Burrow. Tributes paid to Rob Burrow following death at 41.

In February, it was announced that the player of the match award at this year's Super League Grand Final will be renamed after Burrow, the first player to win the trophy twice, in 2007 and 2011.. Tributes flooded in from the rugby league world, with Super League leaders St Helens calling Burrow ""a hero in every sense of the word"" and Wigan Warriors saying that ""his legacy will live on through those whose lives he touched, and his story will continue to inspire all"".. A tribute to Burrow from the Rugby Football League said: ""Since December 2019, his courage and humanity - allied to that of his family, friends and former Leeds Rhinos team-mates, led by Kevin Sinfield CBE - has transcended sport."". The Prince of Wales, who presented the CBE to Burrow and Sinfield at Headingley in a January visit this year, paid tribute on X.. The prince wrote: ""A legend of Rugby League, Rob Burrow had a huge heart. He taught us, 'in a world full of adversity, we must dare to dream.' Catherine and I send our love to Lindsey, Jackson, Maya and Macy."". The MND Association, for whom Burrow became a patron in 2021, said it was ""incredibly grateful to Rob and his family for helping to raise awareness of MND, and funds for the association, by sharing the details of their journey and by inspiring so many people both within the MND community and the wider public"".. ""In doing so much, he inspired support from so many,"" the charity added.. ""It is testament to the strength of feeling people have for Rob that the support in his name has never wavered."".

Burrow, his family and his long-term friend Sinfield used various means to tell their story and help raise awareness of Burrowï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s condition.. In 2022, they contributed to a BBC documentary called Rob Burrow: Living with MND, about love, family, friendships and the reality of living with the condition.. Former team-mate Sinfield, who Burrow met when he was 12, has completed several endurance challenges which have raised a total of more than ï¿½ï¿½7m and been featured in two BBC documentaries.. Burrow began using an eye-controlled computer which put words into a version of his voice to allow him to communicate. Using that machine, he read the CBeebies Bedtime Story on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in 2022.. He also put questions to other sporting legends for an award-winning BBC podcast in 2023 called 'Rob Burrow Seven, Meets...', featuring the likes of Wayne Rooney, Jonny Wilkinson and Mike andall.. Earlier this year, Burrow and Sinfield contributed to a picture book which told the story of a friendship between two young boys named Rob and Kev, and Burrow's widow Lindsey has already written a memoir which is due to be published in 2025.. Burrow's wife Lindsey was a constant support throughout his fundraising. Matt Newsum, BBC rugby league correspondent. For such a diminutive figure, the loss of Rob Burrow casts a big shadow over rugby league - a sport he loved, conquered and championed throughout his life.. From a kid in ill-fitting padding to his highest peaks as a decorated member of the Leeds Rhinos 'golden generation', Rob defied both standard thinking and adversity to become a world-class player.. What was to some a disadvantage - his small stature - he turned into a positive. His tackle technique made him an axe-like cutter in defence, while his speed off the mark and devastating footwork left the big boys pawing at thin air as he left them in his wake. Think a sporting 'Roadrunner' and you're on the right track.. He was also brave as a player - another factor that helped him deal with his later diagnosis - and the sight of him standing up to Hull's huge forward Epalahame Lauaki remains an image many fans will recall fondly.. Burrow achieved all the success and all the glory without changing his personality. I can recall times waiting around in the bowels of Headingley after a rare Leeds loss; he would never refuse the interview, however glum the expression.. He was selfless as a player and this continued in his coaching role as he helped mould the Rhinos stars of tomorrow before his MND diagnosis forced him to step aside.. The wider public came to know what rugby league fans already knew as he challenged his disease with his defiance, shining a beacon on the condition and capturing hearts and minds with his character and spirit.. Rob Burrow was no ordinary rugby league player and certainly no ordinary human being. He was the best of both..

bbc.com,"AI fakes, abuse and misinformation pushed to young voters on TikTok",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ww6vz1l81o,2024-06-02 21:12,"Young voters in key election battlegrounds are being recommended fake AI-generated videos featuring party leaders, misinformation, and clips littered with abusive comments, the BBC has found.. With TikTok emerging as a new social media battleground in this election, the political parties have begun a war of memes on the app in a bid to reach its audience of young voters.. But a BBC project to investigate the content promoted by social media algorithms has found - alongside funny montages - young people on TikTok are being exposed to misleading and divisive content. It is being shared by everyone from students and political activists to comedians and anonymous bot-like accounts.. Videos which have racked up hundreds of thousands of views have promoted unfounded rumours that a major scandal prompted Rishi Sunak to call an early election and the baseless claim that Sir Keir Starmer was responsible for the failure to prosecute serial paedophile Jimmy Savile.. Satirical, fake AI-generated clips show Rishi Sunak declaring, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Please donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t vote us out, we would be proper gutted!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and making unevidenced claims about how the Conservative leader is spending public money - including how he will send his ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½mates loads of doshï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. Other AI-generated videos share misleading claims about his national service pledge for 18-year-olds, suggesting young people would be sent to current war zones in Ukraine and Gaza.. Some of these are described as satire or parody in captions, but the comments suggest some users are confused about which claims are factual.. TikTok told the BBC it had increased its investment in countering misinformation for the UK general election, including adding a fact-checking expert to existing resources and employing AI-labelling technology.. The videos were spotted as part of the BBC's Undercover Voters project, which has created profiles for 24 fictional people on all the major social media sites, based on data and analysis by the National Centre for Social Research (Natcepresent a range of voters in battleground constituencies across the UK, giving an insight into what content is promoted to different types of people. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch content relevant to their character traits informed by the Natcen research.. I examined the feeds of the profiles of three of these fictional voters in the former ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½red wallï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ constituency of Bishop Auckland, a target for Labour which is currently held by the Conservatives - and where our Undercover Voters are younger.. Their social media feeds revealed that, while other sites have also experienced a flurry of political content, TikTok had the most lively conversation, particularly among younger voters.. TikTok has boomed since the last election. According to media regulator Ofcom, it was the fastest-growing source of news in the UK for the second year in a row in 2023 - used by 10% of adults in this way. One in 10 teenagers say it is their most important news source.. TikTng a new generation in the democratic process. Whether you use the social media app or not, what is unfolding on its site could shape narratives about the election and its candidates - including in ways that may be unfounded.. Content promoted to Undercover Voter character Jack, a disaffected 31-year-old, include TikToks misrepresenting remarks made by Labour politicians in speech bubbles. These include comments about immigration, transgender rights, Brexit - and false claims that the shadow international development secretary called to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½abolish the Armyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. Several other videos repeated the unfounded allegations about Sir Keir and Jimmy Savile.. Other videos Jack was served on his feed included clips with threats in the comments about ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½euthanizingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Rishi Sunak and racist remarks about him.. Messages such as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½vote Reform UKï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ were shared repeatedly in the comments of many videos, much more than those I saw in support of any other party. TikTok users have begun to ng the posters ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Reform botsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, suggesting they could be fake, automated accounts.. I contacted some of the commenters who had photos and names on their profiles, and they told me they were real people based in the UK with no official affiliation to Reform UK and with no encouragement or instruction from the party. But others were anonymous with no profile image and numerical usernames - common hallmarks of fake accounts - and they did not respond to my messages.. Whether they are real people or not, their comments can create the impression that their preferred party has greater support.. Another Undercover Voter character based in Bishop Auckland, 25-year-old Chloe, was created to have no prior interest in politics. But about one in 10 posts on her TikTok feed was a political meme or funny video, including official content coming from the Labour Party, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Reform UK.. These include Rishi Sunakï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s first TikTok on the Conservativesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ new account abouifying that he is not forcing all 18-year-olds to join the army. . They also include a video of Cilla Black singing Surprise Surprise from the official Labour profile - with a caption saying ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½POV: Rishi Sunak turning up on your 18th birthday to send you to warï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. A third Undercover Voter named Louise - in her 50s and politically undecided - was pushed more TikToks targeting political leaders with abusive comments, as well as satirical montages and parody videos about policy announcements such as national service.. I tracked down some of the people behind the videos and posts shown to our Undercover Voters.. One 16-year-old from the south of England, who made a satirical edit of that first Rishi Sunak TikTok about national service, said she was surprised how quickly her content took off.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t specifically create this account for the election and the reason I made the TikTok initially was just for a joke - I didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t expect to get over 400k bloody views,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she ted with any party and has not received any money for creating the TikTok.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Social media really is the only platform for young people to have a voice nowadays in my opinion.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. She said she knows satirical content can be ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½controversialï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and she understands how her video ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½could mislead peopleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but would hope people could tell it was supposed to be a bit of fun.. Alongside the video, some users had posted threatening comments towards Mr Sunak, but the 16-year-old said she did not think anyone would actually want to harm a politician.. Dozens of other users I messaged who are creating this content are also in their late teens or early 20s, and want to get involved in creating political videos to engage other people their age in the election. . They all tell me that while they may support a political party, they have not been paid for their posts and are not officially affiliated with any of the campaigns.. One politics student tells me they ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t w mislead others with their opinions about other partiesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. Another person based in Coventry, who shares his videos about Reform UK, tells me he hopes to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½boost their popularity in an unofficial wayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and says he set up his account back in February. He say he is a member of the party and has not received any money for making his TikToks.. He is concerned that satirical content - including his own - might unintentionally mislead people on TikTok. His account was restricted by TikTok for posting spam.. A spokesperson for TikTok told the BBC that it had increased its investment ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½in efforts to ensure reliable information can be found on TikTokï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, launching a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½UK Election Centre with a fact-checking expertï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and adopting an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½industry-leading AI labelling technologyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. It also said it was introducing ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½more policies to aggressively counter foreign election interferenceï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and that it removed 97% of videos with misinformation about elecd out more about the Undercover Voters project on Sunday's episode of Newscast here.

bbc.com,Abbott says she intends to run and win for Labour,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11zp9kxw4o,2024-06-02 17:31,"Diane Abbott has said she intends to stand for Labour at the general election, after a row over whether the party would pick her as a candidate.. After days of speculation, the veteran left-winger said she was the ""adopted Labour candidate"" in Hackney North and Stoke Newington.. A bitter row over whether the party would select her as its candidate in the seat has dominated the first week of campaigning.. Ms Abbott also denied reports she was among a number of Labour MPs who had been offered peerages in return for standing aside.. Writing on X, she said: ""I have never been offered a seat in the Lords, and would not accept one if offered"".. ""I intend to run and to win as Labour's candidate,"" she added. The party is yet to comment.. It comes after Baroness Chakrabarti, a close ally, urged her to ""take some time"" to consider whether she wants to stand for Labour at the general election.. The Labour peer said the party's treatment of her ""dear friend"" had been ""appalling,"" and she hit out at briefings she would be barred from running.. Ms Abbott, a shadow cabinet minister under former leader Jeremy Corbyn, has represented the Hackney North and Stoke Newington seat since 1987.. Asked about a Sunday Times report that Ms Abbott was among Labour MPs offered peerages by the party, Ms Cooper replied: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. Leader Sir Keir Starmer said on Friday she would be free to stand for the party, after reports that its ruling body would bar her from running.. It followed days of speculation that she would be blocked from being a candidate, despite being readmitted as a Labour MP earlier this week before Parliament was dissolved.. The move came after a 13-month investigation into Ms Abbott following the publication of a letter she wrote to a newspaper saying that Jewish, Irish and Traveller people d""all their lives"".. Ms Abbott apologised and withdrew her remarks shortly after they were published.. . Speaking to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Baroness Chakrabarti said the week's to-and-fro over whether she can stand had at times been ""sordid"".. ""Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not good for Keir Starmerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s leadership, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not good for"" she added.. She hit out at ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½anonymous briefings by overgrown schoolboys in suitsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ for the newspaper reports she would be blocked, but added s""personally assured by the leadership"" they had not been authorised by the party.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I hope she will take some time to consider what she wants to do. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s literally what Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve suggested to her as her friend, and I hope thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s what she is going to doï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. Earlier this week, Ms Abbott said she wanted to stay on as Hackney""as long as it is possible"".. Before Sir Keir confirmed she could run, she had previously accused the party leadership of wanting to ""exclude"" her from Parliament..

bbc.com,Swinney urges voters 'to put Scotland's interests first' as he launches SNP campaign,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crggnq0yq99o,2024-06-02 16:41,"John Swinney has urged people to ""vote SNP to put Scotland's interests first"" as he formally launched the party's general election campaign.. Mr Swinney told activists and candidates at a rally in Glasgow that Westminster decision-making had meant ""austerity, Brexit and a cost of living crisis being imposed on Scotland"".. Scotland's first minister stressed his belief in independence as a way to ensure decisions about Scotland are made in Scotland.. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said John Swinney's ""relaunch of a shambolic campaign"" proved he was more interested in his party than the people.. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accused Mr Swinney of ""pandering to his Nationalist base and pitting Scot against Scot in a bid to break up the UK"".. Meanwhile, Scottish Lib Dems leader Alex Cole-Hamilton also criticised the SNP's continued push for a second independence referendum - insisting voters simply ""don't care"".. However, Mr Swinney has called on the public to back his party's indy stance in the 4 July general election and use the vote as a direct way to remove the Conservatives from government.. He said: ""A combination of Westminster cuts and Brexit has reduced the money available for the NHS, other public services and housing.. ""Brexit alone has wiped billions from the Scottish economy compared with EU membership. And it's pushed up food and other household costs.. ""Given the UK is moving so badly in the wrong direction I would be failing in my duty if I did not set out what I believe is a better future for Scotland."". Following his election as first minister last month, Mr Swinney called for more respect to be shown in Scottish politics.. Looking ahead to the UK-wide general election, he said he believes in ""the politics of persuasion or, if that's not possible, respectful disagreement""..  He told those at the rally that ""in our wonderful, diverse, inspiring country"" everyone should have a chance to get on in life.. ""It's why I believe so strongly in eradicating child poverty,"" the first minister will say.. ""At this election it is those principles that will guide my approach. So I am asking people to vote SNP to remove the Tories from government.. ""I'm asking people to vote SNP to put Scotland's interests first. I'm asking people to vote for a future made in Scotland, for Scotland."". Mr Swinney also highlighted what the he said the SNP had achieved in government, including:. Analysis by Phil Sim, BBC Scotland political correspondent. John Swinneyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s calculation is that a Labour win is already priced in for many in this election.. At his launch event, he predicted that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the Tories are on course for a huge defeat, a wipeoutï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. The pitch is that the Tories are toast anyway, and Labour will have a big majority - so Scots donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t actually need to vote for Labour to achieve that. Indeed, he says they should vote for the SNP to keep Labour honest - to hold their feet to the fire.. Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s painting them as already being complacent - ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½they think Scotland is in the bagï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. The question is whether this message - that people can have a Labour government without actually voting Labour - will cut through with voters, compared to the rather more straightforward ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½changeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ narrative Sir Keir Starmer is selling.. Speaking on BBC Scotland's Tilton said his party was not talking about independence during this campaign ""because literally no-one on the doorsteps is talking about it - they donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"".. He added: ""We donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t believe there should be a second referendum ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not salient to p""People want to talk about getting access to a GP at the first time of asking, or NHS dentists in their locality.. ""They want to talk about taking the sewage out of our rivers and lifting up Scottish education to where it used to be."". Speaking on the campaign trail in Renfrew, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the SNP had spent the entire campaign so far attacking Labour when the real opportunity was to ""get rid of this rotten Tory government"".. He said: ""Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s what weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re focused on ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ getting rid of Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman and the whole, rot""People across Scotland realise after 14 years of corruption, chaos, lies and sleaze from the Conservative party that this is Scotlandï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s opportunity to get rid of them. And the only way we do that is if we elect a UK Labour gover"". Mr Sarwar said he was confident previous SNP supporters would switch to Labour on 4 July.. ""I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t care how you voted in the past. I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t care how you voted in the referendum. I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t care how you would possibly vote in fut""What I care about just now is getting rid of this rotten Tory government, so letï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s go on this part of the journey together and change our co"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr Swinney had made ""a desperate attempt"" to relaunch the SNPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s election cam""in the wake of his shameful mishandling of the Michael Matheson scandal"".. Mr Matheson - a former health secretary - was last week handed a record ban from parliament for breaching Holyrood's expenses policy. . And police are now assessing a new complaint over the SNP MSP's ï¿½ï¿½11,000 iPad data roaming bill.. Douglas Ross said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Predictably, he (Mr Swinney) used it to double down on the SNPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s independence obsession, instead of focusing on the peopleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s real priorities ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As he showed in the Matheson scandal, John Swinney wil"". Mr Ross added: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Voters who have had enough of SNP incompetence and their endless sowing of division have the chance to punish them on Jul""In key seats across the country, only the Scottish Conservatives can beat the SNP and move the focus on to the issues that really matter.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

But Sydnie Christmas took the top prize, ahead of Jack Rhodes in second and dancers Abigail & Afronitaaa in third.. The judges of the ITV show, Simon Cowell, Bruno Tonioli, Alesha Dixon and Amanda Holden, returned for one last time this series, alongside hosts Ant and Dec..

She sa""I don't know what to say, I cannot believe the amount of love that I've felt.. ""I am overwhelmed with love and it's the most amazing thing and I wish every person in this room feels the way I do with this love, it's amazing, thank you so much."". The series has, as ever, been filled with spectacular talent and incredible acts.. A magician who used to film parody videos of auditioning for Britain's Got Talent is one of the show's finalists.. Jack Rhodes, from Ulverston, Cumbria, earned a spot in the ITV programme's grand final by impressing the audience and judges with his crate of death stunt.. He was described as ""now the favourite to win the entire competition"" by Cowell.. But he faced stiff competition, including from winner Christmas and a Northamptonshire singing group.. Northants Sings Out passed the semi-final stage after a split decision by the judges meant the public had the last say. It took them one step closer to becoming the first choir to win BGT.. Comedian Alex Mitchell and magician Trixy were the last two acts to make it through to the final, after a tense semi-final show on Friday.. Mitchell won the most public votes, after a stand-up routine which saw him poke fun at his autism and tics.. The judges then had to decide who they would put through to the final between the second and third most popular act, as voted for by the public..

bbc.com,US expects Israel will accept Gaza ceasefire plan if Hamas does,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11l590qqwo,2024-06-02 20:42,"The US government has ""every expectation"" that Israel will accept a ceasefire proposal that would begin with a six-week cessation of hostilities in Gaza if Hamas takes the deal, according to National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. . The three-part plan unveiled by President Joe Biden last week would also be a ""surge"" of humanitarian aid, as well as an exchange of some hostages for Palestinian prisoners before a permanent end to the war. . The proposal, however, has met with vocal opposition from some members of Israel's government. . The negotiations come as fighting continues in Rafah, which came under intense Israeli airstrikes over the weekend. . According to the UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, all 36 of its shelters in the Rafah area are empty after residents were forced to flee. . Another 1.7 million people are estimated to be displaced in Khan Younis and parts of central Gaza. . Speaking to ABC News on Sunday morning, Mr Kirby said that the US had ""every expectation"" that Israel would ""say yes"" to the proposed ceasefire deal if Hamas accepts. . ""We're waiting for an official response from Hamas,"" he said, adding that the US hopes that both sides agree to start the first phase of the plan ""as soon as possible"". . During that initial six-week pause in the fighting, Mr Kirby said the ""two sides would sit down and try to negotiate what phase two could look like, and when that could begin"".. In a televised address last week, Mr Biden said that the second phase of the plan would see all remaining living hostages returned, including male soldiers. The ceasefire would then become ""the cessation of hostilities, permanently"".. On Saturday, however, two far-right Israeli ministers threatened to quit and collapse the country's governing coalition if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to the deal. . Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said they were opposed to striking any deal before Hamas was destroyed.. Similarly, Mr Netanyahu has insisted that there will be no ceasefire until Hamasï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s military and governing capabilities are destroyed and all hostages are released.. Hanoch Milwidsky, a senior member of the Knesset for Mr Netanyahu's Likud Party, told the BBC on Sunday that Israel's governing coalition is unified in opposition to the deal, which he c""completely unacceptable"". . ""The math of the Israeli government has not changed - that means Hamas can no longer rule Gaza, can no longer have any capability, not military not any civilian capability to be in power, and all the hostages need to come back,"" Mr Milwidsky  said. ""The war will not stop until these demands are met."" . Mr Kirby, for his part, said that US intelligence now believes that Hamas has been militarily degraded to the extent that it can no longer repeat an attack such as that which its fighters conducted on 7 October. . ""We've not said that they don't still represent a viable threat to the Israeli people. Of course they do,"" he said. ""But they don't have the military capabilities to do what they did."" . In another development on Sunday, the government of the Maldives announced it would ban Israeli citizens from the Indian Ocean island archipelago, in turn prompting a warning from Israel's foreign ministry that its citizens should avoid the country. . About 11,000 Israelis visited the Maldives last year - less than 1% of all tourist arrivals. . More than 36,000 people have been killed across Gaza since the start of the conflict, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.. The war began in October when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to Gaza as hostages.. In the US, President Biden has faced growing domestic criticism over the level of US support for Israel, as well as calls to do more to encourage the warring sides to negotiate.. The former president says he is ""okay"" with the possibility of being jailed after his New York conviction.. At least 25 people have been shot in the US city of Akron, police say..

bbc.com,Donald Trump says hush-money trial 'very hard' on wife Melania,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nndr47kgzo,2024-06-02 20:39,"Donald Trump has said his historic trial and criminal conviction have been ""very hard"" for his wife, former First Lady Melania Trump. . Last week, jurors found Mr Trump guilty of falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments made to former porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election campaign.. With the verdict, he became the first US president to be convicted of a crime. He has repeatedly called the trial rigged and politically motivated. . In an interview with Fox News over the weekend, Mr Trump vowed that success at the upcoming November US election would be his ""revenge"". . He is slated to be sentenced on 11 July, and plans to appeal the convictions. . Speaking to Fox on Sunday, Mr Trump said his New York legal battle has been particularly difficult on his wife. . The trial included lurid details of the alleged meeting between Mr Trump and Ms Daniels. . The details included Mr Trump greeting her in silk pyjamas at his hotel suite, and Ms Daniels' claims that he did not wear protection when they allegedly had sex. . In her testimony, Ms Daniels also claimed that Mr Trump and his wife sleep in different beds. . ""She's fine, but I think it's very hard for her,"" Mr Trump said of his wife, adding that ""in many ways, it's tougher on them [his family] than it is me"". . Under New York law, each of the 34 felony counts Mr Trump was convicted of could result in up to four years in prison - though this is not considered a likely outcome. . In his interview on Fox, Mr Trump acknowledged the possibility of being imprisoned, saying that he is ""okay with it"" but that he is ""not sure the public would stand for it"". . ""I think it would be tough for the public to take,"" he said. ""You know, at a certain point there's a breaking point."" . In another interview published over the weekend, the woman at the heart of the New York case - former adult film actress Stormy Daniels - said she was ""shocked"" at how quickly the jury reached a verdict. . In her first public remarks since the convictions, Ms Daniels told UK newspaper The Mirror that she believes Mr Trump ""should be sentenced to jail and some community service working for the less fortunate"".. ""Or being the volunteer punching bag at a woman's shelter,"" she added. . Even after the conviction, Ms Daniels said that the case is ""not over"" for her. . ""It's never going to be over for me,"" she said. ""Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy."" . Mr Trump is still facing dozens of other charges in three other criminal cases, including a Georgia case in which he is accused of conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat by President Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 election. That case is currently tied up in appeals. . In Florida - where he faces a federal case over his alleged mishandling of classified documents - a judge has indefinitely postponed the trial, saying setting a date before resolving questions about evidence would be ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½imprudentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. The White House believes Hamas has been weakened to a point that it cannot repeat the 7 October attack. . At least 25 people have been shot in the US city of Akron, police say.. He warned China not to cross a red line as their standoff in the South China Sea escalates.. It would begin with a six-week ceasefire and the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas. .

Mr Murdoch, 93, tied the knot on Saturday with his new wife Elena Zhukova, 67, a retired Russian biologist.. He was rumoured to be dating Ms Zhukova soon after his engagement to ex-police chaplain Ann Lesley Smith was abruptly called off in April 2023.. Australian-born Mr Murdoch, who has six children, is chairman emeritus of News Corporation, which owns Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the Sun and the Times.. He stepped down as chairman of Fox and News Corp last year, leaving his son Lachlan to head both companies.. Mr Murdoch and Ms Zhukova are said to have met at a party hosted by one of his ex-wives, Chinese-born entrepreneur Wendi Deng.. His other former spouses are Australian flight attendant Patricia Booker, Scottish-born journalist Anna Mann, and US model and actress Jerry Hall..

bbc.com,South Africa president faces up to poor poll result,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx99vww50y5o,2024-06-02 22:22,"South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has admitted his African National Congress (ANC) party has suffered a challenging election result, after the party lost its majority for the first time since apartheid ended 30 years ago.. The ANC, once led by Nelson Mandela, won 159 seats in the 400-seat parliament in Wednesday's election, down from 230 in the previous assembly.. Mr Ramaphosa still described the results as a victory for democracy, calling on rival parties to find common ground - apparently preparing for coalition talks. . The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party has said it is open to coalition talks with Mr Ramaphosa, but it opposes a number of his government's key priorities. . With all the votes counted, the ANC finished on 40% - down from 58% at the previous election, the electoral commission announced on Sunday.. This was lower than the party's feared worst-case scenario of 45%, analysts said. The ANC now must go into a coalition to form the next government.. . ""Our people have spoken, whether we like it or not, they have spoken,"" Mr Ramaphosa said.. ""As the leaders of political parties, as all those who occupy positions of responsibility in society, we have heard the voices of our people and we must respect their wishes."". He added that the voters wanted the parties to find common ground.. ""Through their votes, they have demonstrated clearly and plainly that our democracy is strong and it is enduring,"" he said.. South Africa's political parties have two weeks to work out a coalition deal, then the new parliament will sit to choose a president.. The centre-right DA remains the second-largest party in parliament with 87 seats, and has said it is open to talks of a coalition.. ""We urge all others who love our constitution and all it represents to set aside petty politics and narrow sectarian interests and join hands now,"" DA leader John Steenhuisen said.. However, his party opposes two of the ANC's key priorities - its black empowerment policies, which aim to giving black people a stake in the economy following their exclusion during the racist apartheid era, and the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill, which promises universal healthcare for all. . The ANC has said both policies are non-negotiable in coalition talks. . Former president Jacob Zuma, who now leads the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party that came third with 58 seats, did not attend the results announcement and had suggested that he might challenge them.. The MK has said it would be prepared to work with the ANC, but not while it was led by Mr Ramaphosa.. He replaced Mr Zuma as both president and ANC leader following a bitter power struggle in 2018.. In a BBC interview, Patrick Gaspard, who was the US ambassador to South Africa in 2013-16, described the two politicians as ""sworn enemies"".. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Zuma called for an election rerun and said the electoral commission should not announce the final results.. On Saturday, he warned the commission that it would ""be provoking us"" if it ignored his demand for a fresh election, and for an independent investigation into his party's claims that it was rigged.. ""Donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t start trouble when there is no trouble,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said.. There are now concerns over how Mr Zuma's supporters may respond to the results.. The 82-year-old has been the political wildcard in this election - and he is preparing to flex his muscles as the kingmaker in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal, where the MK party has wrestled a huge chunk of votes from the ANC.. Formed just a few months ago, results show that for the national election, it has taken the largest share of the vote in the province - 44% to the ANC's 19%.. Local issues could have been a big factor in that shift, with some community members turning their backs on the ANC party because it had failed to fix acute water shortages.. Parts of the province, such as Trenance Park, which is a mere 20 minutes' drive from the main city of Durban, have had no tap water for 10 months.. Residents rely on water tankers that sometimes do not deliver water on time.. People in KwaZulu-Natal hope that now the election is over, the problem will  good.. Earlier, South Africa's police chief warned that threats to destabilise the country would not be tolerated.. ""There cannot be any room for threats of instability in order to register objections or concerns about the electoral processes,""  Police Minister Bheki Cele said at a news conference.. The ANC has always polled above 50% since the country's first democratic elections in 1994, which saw Nelson Mandela become president.. But support for the party has been dropping significantly because of anger over high levels of corruption, unemployment and crime.. ""There are tens of millions of young people in that country who are called the Born Free generation, born after 1994 after the end of apartheid, and they feel that their country underwent a political transformation, but not an economic one,"" Mr Gaspard told the BBC. . He added that back in 2015 ""it was already becoming abundantly clear that there was a downward trajectory for the ANC because it was failing to deliver on essential services in the country"", specifically mentioning rolling blackouts.. The full schedule, including start time and venues, and results for the Men's T20 World Cup 2024. . The ANC has dominated South Africa for the past 30 years but now it has to look to the future.. Cyril Ramaphosa has led the ruling ANC to its worst result since it won the first democratic vote in 1994.. The T20 World Cup is more than cricket's attempt to crack America, it is also the game finally opening its doors to the whole planet, says Stephan Shemilt..

bbc.com,New blood test 'can predict' breast cancer return,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjjjnxdv188o,2024-06-02 15:12,"An ""ultra-sensitive"" new blood test can predict if breast cancer will return years before the disease shows up on scans, researchers say.. It picks up traces of a tumour's DNA before a full relapse and was found to be 100% accurate at predicting which patients would see their cancer return.. It is hoped that the test can allow treatment to start earlier and improve survival rates.. The UK research has been branded ""incredibly exciting"" by experts but is still in its early stages.. Breast cancer is the most common form of the disease worldwide, with 2.26 million women diagnosed in 2020 and 685,000 deaths in the same year, according to Breast Cancer UK. . A team of researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) London conducted the trial on 78 patients with different types of early breast cancer.. The ""liquid biopsy"" looked for 1,800 mutations in the patients' blood which are released by cancer cells. . These circulating tumour DNA were found in 11 women, who all saw their cancer relapse. No other women saw their cancer return. . On average, the blood test detected cancer 15 months before symptoms appeared or the illness showed up on scans,  according to results presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago on Sunday.. The earliest detection was 41 months before a scan confirmed the diagnosis. . Lead researcher Dr Isaac Garcia-Murillas, from the ICR, said: ""Breast cancer cells can remain in the body after surgery and other treatments but there can be so few of these cells that they are undetectable on follow-up scans."". He added that the cells can cause patients to relapse many years after their initial treatment.. Dr Garcia-Murillas said the study lays the groundwork for better post-treatment monitoring and potentially life-extending treatment.. Researchers tested blood samples at the point of diagnosis, then again following surgery and chemotherapy.. These tests were then repeated every three months for the next year and every six months for the next five years.. Dr Simon Vincent, director of research, support and influencing at Breast Cancer Now - which part-funded the study - said: ""Early detection is one of our greatest weapons against breast cancer and these initial findings, which suggests new tests could be able to detect signs of breast cancer recurrence over a year before symptoms emerge, are incredibly exciting."". Though acknowledging that the research was still in its early stages, he said catching breast cancer recurrence earlier means treatment is much more likely to destroy the cancer and stop it spreading to other parts of the body and becoming incurable. . Dr Vincent continued: ""With around 11,000 people dying every year in the UK from secondary breast cancer, breakthroughs like these are urgently needed so that we can stop people losing their lives to this devastating disease."". It is unclear when the test could become widely available. . The news follows a number of developments in cancer research in the past week.. It comes after saliva tests carried out at home were found to be better at identifying men at higher risk of prostate cancer than standard blood tests.. And on Friday it was announced that thousands of NHS cancer patients in England are expected to get access to trials of a new type of treatment using personalised vaccines to fight their disease.. But on Monday a cancer charity said the number of melanoma skin-cancer cases in the UK was expected to hit record levels..

bbc.com,Tories pledge new GP surgeries in community care boost,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2289vk0n1o,2024-06-01 21:32,"The Conservatives have promised to build 100 new GP surgeries in England and boost the number of available appointments by allowing more treatments in the community if they win the election. . The party says it would also expand the number of treatments pharmacies can offer without people seeing their GP first. . Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the plan would make it easier for patients to get the care they need and help relieve pressure on hospitals.. Labour said the announcement was the ""latest empty promise"" from the Tories on health.. . The Tories said they wanted to expand the Pharmacy First scheme, which was launched in January and allows people in England to go to their local pharmacy for seven common conditions, rather than their GP, as well as get a prescription for the oral contraceptive pill. . Under the party's plans for the next parliament, pharmacies would also be able to offer contraceptive patches and injections, as well as treatment for more conditions, including acne and chest infections. . It said this would free up 20 million GP appointments once fully rolled out. . The party has also pledged to build 50 new Community Diagnostic Centres, which it said would deliver a further 2.5 million tests a year once scaled up. . The Tories said its plans - expected to cost ï¿½ï¿½1bn per annum - would be paid for by cutting the number of NHS managers to pre-pandemic levels and halving management consultancy spend across government. . It said an overhaul of planning guidance would also help pay for 100 new GPgeries and 150 surgery modernisations, by ensuring health gets a bigger proportion of contributions from housing developers. . Mr Sunak said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As part of our clear plan we are investing in community services making it quicker, easier and more convenient for patients to receive the care they need and help to relieve pressure on hospital ser"". Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Pharmacies, GPs and Community Diagnostic Centres are the backbone of our NHS. Because of bold action we have taken, they are more accessible in more places for more p"". The National Pharmacy Association said the plan to extend the pharmacy scheme was an ""affordable way to cut waiting times"". . But the association's chief executive, Paul Rees, said community pharmacies were currently ""chronically underfunded"" and more investment to was needed to prevent closures and the system being ""irreparably damagedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. The Conservatives said 98% of pharmacies had signed up to the scheme and those already involved were receiving more funding.. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting accused the Conservatives of  breaking their last manifesto promise to recruit more GPs.. He said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Labour will train thousands more GPs and cut the red tape that ties up GPs time, so we can bring back the family doctor.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have pl""ticking time bomb"" for the NHS with a funding boost for health checks. . The party's manifesto will include a commitment to increase the Public Health Grant, which it says will help fund health checks for 40-74-year-olds, health visits for infants and their mothers, and wider access to blood pressure tests. . The grant provides funding to local authorities to spend on preventative services to improve public health. . Deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the policy would reverse the ""scandalous"" cuts made by the Conservatives since 2015. . ""It is time to recognise that it is far cheaper to prevent ill health than to treat it,"" she said.. The party said ï¿½ï¿½1bn of investment in the grants per year would be funded through a crackdown on tax evasion. .

bbc.com,Starmer promises to cut net migration if Labour wins election,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn331vd99lzo,2024-06-02 17:35,"Labour is promising to cut net migration to the UK if it wins the election next month, but will not set an overall target.. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her party would reduce the need for overseas workers by improving training of British workers.. She argued that not setting a target was ""sensible"" because the Conservatives had ""discredited the whole system"" by previously missing targets.. But the Tories said ""no-one believes Keir Starmer is serious about tackling immigration"". . Speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Cooper acknowledged that new salary levels announced by the government were yet to ""play through"" and would further restrict companies' access to work visas.. But she added that Labour wanted to go further to cut reliance on foreign workers in sectors including construction, IT, social care, health and engineering.. The party says if it wins power, it will pass a new law to force different parts of the government to draw up skills improvement plans in high-migration sectors. It is not yet clear how these plans would be enforced.. Ms Cooper said Labour wanted to see ""significant changes in placeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ across the economy to reduce reliance on overseas workers.. But she added the party would not set a migration target because the Conservative""ended up being totally all over the place"" when they did.. She also argued that other factors would produce variations ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½from one year to an"" citing the pandemic and the UK's decision to accept Ukrainian refugees as recent examples.. Leader Sir Keir Starmer told the Sun on Sunday: ""Mark my words, a future Labour government will bring down net migration."". Last year, net migration - the number of people coming to the UK, minus the number leaving - was 685,000, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.. Earlier this year, the government introduced new laws designed to cut immigration numbers.. They included increasing the minimum salary requirement for some skilled work visas by nearly 50%, as well as increasing the salary requirement for skilled workers to bring family dependents with them.. Ms Cooper said Labour supported those changes, acknowledging they would ""lead to further restrictions on visas"".. Labour also wants to lengthen the bans on hiring foreign workers that can be handed down to firms that breach employment law, such as by paying below the minimum wage.. A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said the Labour policy announced on Sunday was a ""U-turn"" on Sir Keir's principles.. ""This is the man who called all immigration laws racist and voted against tougher border controls 139 times,"" the spokesperson said.. That refers to a book review Sir Keir wrote when he was a lawyer in the late 1980s, in which he said the author had highlighted the ""racist undercurrent which permeates all immigration law"".. Alison Thewliss, from the SNP, said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Instead of coming forward with policies based on Scotlandï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s needs, Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are both amping up the far-right belief that migrants are to blame for all of our problems - but itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not migrants, i"".

bbc.com,"Focus on GDP not way to fairer society, say Greens",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511lz64rrpo,2024-06-02 13:50,"The co-leader of the Green Party has told the BBC that finding different ways to measure economic success would help build a fairer society.. The party has long argued that economic growth drives over-exploitation of resources and should not be the default aim for governments.. Adrian Ramsay said relying on gross domestic product (GDP) to judge the state of the economy was a ""blunt instrument"".. He added that a ""wider range of economic measures"" should be reflected when deciding what policies to pursue. . It marks a contrast with other political parties, which usually put their plans to boost economic growth front and centre in election campaigns.. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Ramsay defended his party's approach, adding they had a ""strong message about the sort of economy we want to see"".. ""The principle for Greens is that just using GDP as a measure of economic success is a blunt instrument,"" he added.. He added that the statistic ""doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t tell us about how unequal our socie"" or whether public services are working, or measure impacts on the environment.. ""We need to have a wider range of economic measures which are about health and happiness, prosperity, jobs, public services,"" he added.. He added that policies such as its proposed tax on the wealthiest 1% would help fund improvements to the NHS.. The UK's main GDP measure is produced by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and tries to measure the overall size of the economy.. It plays an important role in deciding tax and spending decisions, because the government relies on official forecasts for GDP to work out which policies are affordable.. It is also expected to play a major role in the UK's general election campaign. . Rishi Sunak cited economic growth figures in his speech announcing the poll, whilst Labour has made achieving the ""highest sustained growth"" in the G7 club of wealthy nations one of its five missions for power. . In recent years, a number of alternative measures have been developed that try to capture other aspects of the economy.. Since 2010, the ONS has also measured well-being, external alongside economic growth. This assesses health, relationships, education and skills, as well as people's personal finances and the environment.. However, critics say GDP still occupies too important a role in debates about the economy. . In documents setting out their philosophy, the Greens say it promotes a focus on ""consumerism"" and other indicators would better capture the extent to which economic policies protect nature and improve well-being.. . The Green Party of England and Wales is separate to the Scottish Greens, which stands candidates in Scotland.. It is aiming to run in every English and Welsh seat for the first time, requiring it to pick 103 more candidates than at the last election in 2019.. However, it is expected to focus on a small number of target seats, including the new seat of Waveney Valley, where Mr Ramsay is the party's candidate.. Other targets include the new seat of Bristol Central, North Herefordshire, and Brighton Pavilion, where the Greens only current MP, Caroline Lucas, is standing down..

Mr Sunak's announcement ended months of speculation about when the UK would go to the polls.. The general election is to elect Members of Parliament - or MPs - to the House of Commons.. The UK is divided into 650 areas, called constituencies, and each of these elects one MP to represent local residents at Westminster.. Most candidates represent a political party, but some stand as independents. . Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare?. Why did Sunak decide to call summer election?. Is it 1997 all over again as Tory MPs head for the exit?. In a general election, each person has one vote. . On election day, registered voters in each constituency vote for their preferred candidate in their local polling station. Some people vote by post in advance. . Under a system called ""first past the post"", the candidate who gets the most votes becomes the MP for that area. . This election will be fought on new constituency boundaries, redrawn to reflect population changes and to try to even out voter numbers in each area.. Use our tool to find out which constituency you are in and an estimate of what the result would have been had these new boundaries been in place at the last general election, in 2019.. Network connection lost.  Please check your connection.. After the votes have been counted, the King asks the leader of the party with the most MPs to become prime minister and to form a government.. The leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes the leader of the opposition.. If no party ends up with a majority of MPs - meaning it cannot pass legislation with just its own MPs - the result is a hung parliament.. At this point, the largest party might decide to form a coalition government with another party or operate as a minority government, relying on votes from other parties to pass any laws.. The new Parliament has been called to meet on 9 July, when it will elect a Speaker and swear in members. .

bbc.com,What do candidate selections tell us about Starmer's Labour?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c800g7qlrjzo,2024-06-02 00:22,"Sir Keir Starmer has been accused of freezing out left-wingers and promoting his supporters, as Labour heads into the general election.. The party now has a full slate of candidates in place after scrambling to fill vacancies following the surprise announcement that the election is taking place on 4 July.. The process has been dominated by a bitter row over whether veteran MP Diane Abbott, an ally of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, will be allowed to stand.. At the same time, the party has been accused of ""parachuting"" Starmerite candidates into seats over the wishes of local Labour members.. The full list of candidates will now have to be endorsed at a meeting of the national executive committee (NEC), the party's ruling body, on Tuesday.. But has Sir Keir really banished the left - and what do the selections tell us about what the party would look like in Parliament if it wins power? . The Labour leader cannot hire and fire candidates at will ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but he does have a lot of power over the kind of people that get chosen.. The vast majority of the party's election candidates were already in place before the election was called, selected by local branches from centrally-approved longlists.. But the short time before polling day on 4 July has reduced the role of local members, with the national party following an accelerated process to fill target seats, or where MPs are standing down or suspended.. In this case it is a panel of NEC members - a committee dominated by Starmer supporters - who review applications and choosparty's candidate. . The roll call of new faces contains potential clues as to what a Starmer government would look like if the Labour leader enters the doors of Downing Street in five weeks' time.. Candidates close to the Labour leadership include Heather Iqbal, a former adviser to Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, and Chris Ward, Sir Keir's former deputy chief of staff. . Mr Ward has been chosen to fight Brighton Kemptown, the seat which was held by Lloyd Russell-Moyle. . The left-winger says he has been made a ""sacrificial lamb"" after he was suspended by the party this week over a complaint about his behaviour, which he said was ""vexatious and politically motivated"". . In Chingford and Woodford Green another figure on the left of the party - Faiza Shaheen - was blocked from standing and replaced with a Starmer supporter. . Shama Tatler, a councillor in Brent, is co-chair of the Labour To Win group, which was launched to support Sir Keir's leadership after his election.. Perhaps the most politically on-brand selection is Georgia Gould, the leader of Sir Keir's local Camden council and daughter of Blair-era strategist Lord Philip Gould.. As head of the north London authority, she has championed the ""mission-driven"" approach to governing, with teams organised around broad long-term goals, which Sir Keir has put at the heart of his plan for power.. Policy experts from Starmer-friendly think tank Labour Together are also on the list.. These include Josh Simons, who resigned as a party policy adviser after seven months under Mr Corbyn's tenure and is now its candidate in the safe seat of Makerfield.. Long-regarded as a sounding board for the Starmerite wing of the party, Labour Together has donated staff to several shadow cabinet ministers and is expected to be influential in shaping the party's manifesto.. Another candidate from the think tank world is Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, which has a focus on low pay.. One other eye-catching feature of recent selections is those who have a military background, perhaps reflecting Sir Keir's focus on the importance of national security. . These include former Royal Marine Colonel Alistair Carns and RAF pilot Calvin Bailey. . The installation of pro-Starmer candidates - and the blocking of some left-wingers - has led to accusations of a last-minute ""purge"" before the election.. But the Starmification of the Labour machine has been going on under the radar for some time. . Elections to the NEC in 2020 were a key moment, with Sir Keir solidifying his grip on the committee through the election of candidates who stood on a pro-leadership platform. . Several of these NEC members have now been chosen to fight very winnable parliamentary seats. . Labour To Win activists Luke Akehurst and Gurinder Singh Josan, who have been vocal Starmer supporters, have been chosen as the candidates for North Durham and Smethwick, which both have healthy Labour majorities. . But while the left of the party has no doubt been weakened by the ousting of key figures like Mr Corbyn, it has not been obliterated altogether. . Sir Keir has now said Ms Abbott will be allowed to stand for Labour if she chooses to. . More than 25 members of the Socialist Campaign Group remain Labour candidates, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Richard Burgon and Zarah Sultana. . If Labour wins power, the smaller its majority the more powerful this bloc will be as Sir Keir may have to rely on their votes to pass legislation. .

Latest chart update: 1 June 2024. Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare?. If the chart above hasn't loaded, please click here.. Latest update: 2 June 2024. We're now well into the election campaign, and Parliament has officially been dissolved, but there's been no real shift in the polls since Rishi Sunak fired the starting gun on 22 May, writes BBC senior political analyst Peter Barnes.. On average, Labour has been on 44% or 45% since then and the Conservatives have been on 23% or 24%.. The other parties haven't seen any movement either.. There has been quite a big spread between the different pollsters though. Labour's lead has been as low as 12% in one poll but as high as 27% in others.. Much of this difference is down to how the different polling companies handle people who say they don't know how they'll vote.. As we get closer to polling day, the number of undecided voters should fall which might mean that the polls begin to converge.. However, it's unclear whether this will have an impact on the parties' average poll ratings.. All polls are based on a sample of people interviewed, typically more than 1,000, which is then weighted to be representative of the country.. There is always a margin of error, meaning the real percentage could be higher or lower than any one poll suggests.. We estimate that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown here.. Percentage range of party support, excluding 'don't know' and 'won't vote'. Ranges given in brackets. *Because the SNP and Plaid Cymru only campaign in Scotland and Wales respectively, the margin of error for their support across Great Britain is likely to be within +/- 1%. Individual poll data is published online by the different companies.. Where a party has polled less than 0.5%, it is shown in the table below as 0 due to rounding down the numbers.. Scroll vertically or horizontally to see more polling data. * = Polling company conducted interviews either partly or entirely by telephone. All other polls were online.. Each dot in the chart shows one poll result for a party. . We summarise all that information with an average line that makes it easier to understand the trend.. To get an appropriate range of polls for our averages, we use those conducted by members of the British Polling Council., external. Its members agree to the same rules on transparency, but the council has said membership should not be seen as a guarantee of quality.. The polls we include have come from BMG, Deltapoll, Electoral Calculus, Find Out Now, focaldata, Ipsos, JL Partners, More in Common, Opinium, Panelbase, People Polling, Redfield and Wilton Strategies, Survation, Techne, Verian (formerly Kantar Public), WeThink (formerly Omnisis), Whitestone Insight and YouGov.. We only include the headline percentages on voting intention, which pollsters calculate by excluding those people who answered ""don't know"" or ""won't vote"".. Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK. People surveyed do not get the option to choose parties which only stand in Northern Ireland.. We include data that is in the public domain. Some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time.. Where polling companies have stated in their data tables who their client is, we have included this in our table. It is common for polling companies to do their work for news organisations, television programmes and campaign groups. . The true position for the Conservatives and Labour might be within five percentage points of our average.. Nine out of 10 polls just before election day have been within that range of the eventual national vote shares in the 2010 to 2019 general elections.. The gap has been smaller for other parties which campaign throughout Great Britain and smaller still for the SNP and Plaid Cymru.. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls.. A party's share on any given day is the average of their results from polls taken over the previous fortnight. We only take the most recent poll from each company for that day's averages.. All opinion polls will differ a bit because they are interviewing different people. There are also other things that can lead to differences between polling companies. For example:. Different companies find the people who take part in their polls in different ways. The precise wording of the question varies between pollsters, and some pollsters ask more than one question to reach their voting intention figures. Pollsters apply ""weights"" to their data to try to make their results reflect the make-up of the voting population. So if a particular poll has a smaller proportion of female respondents than there are in the wider population, their responses will be given extra weight in the final results. But different companies take different factors into account. The companies have different ways of treating people who initially say they do not know how they will vote, or are not certain if they will vote.. For voting intention, polling companies typically ask interviewees a question along the lines of: ""If a general election were held tomorrow, which party would you vote for?"". Some polling companies have not given their interviewees the choice of some parties, including them within the ""other"" category.. For example, Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party until 2021, has only been included as an option in every poll featured in our tracker since autumn 2022, while support for Plaid Cymru is included among ""other"" parties in polls released by Techne..

bbc.com,SNP's Swinney to urge voters 'to put Scotland's interests first',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crggnq0yq99o,2024-06-02 16:41,"John Swinney has urged people to ""vote SNP to put Scotland's interests first"" as he formally launched the party's general election campaign.. Mr Swinney told activists and candidates at a rally in Glasgow that Westminster decision-making had meant ""austerity, Brexit and a cost of living crisis being imposed on Scotland"".. Scotland's first minister stressed his belief in independence as a way to ensure decisions about Scotland are made in Scotland.. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said John Swinney's ""relaunch of a shambolic campaign"" proved he was more interested in his party than the people.. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accused Mr Swinney of ""pandering to his Nationalist base and pitting Scot against Scot in a bid to break up the UK"".. Meanwhile, Scottish Lib Dems leader Alex Cole-Hamilton also criticised the SNP's continued push for a second independence referendum - insisting voters simply ""don't care"".. However, Mr Swinney has called on the public to back his party's indy stance in the 4 July general election and use the vote as a direct way to remove the Conservatives from government.. He said: ""A combination of Westminster cuts and Brexit has reduced the money available for the NHS, other public services and housing.. ""Brexit alone has wiped billions from the Scottish economy compared with EU membership. And it's pushed up food and other household costs.. ""Given the UK is moving so badly in the wrong direction I would be failing in my duty if I did not set out what I believe is a better future for Scotland."". Following his election as first minister last month, Mr Swinney called for more respect to be shown in Scottish politics.. Looking ahead to the UK-wide general election, he said he believes in ""the politics of persuasion or, if that's not possible, respectful disagreement""..  He told those at the rally that ""in our wonderful, diverse, inspiring country"" everyone should have a chance to get on in life.. ""It's why I believe so strongly in eradicating child poverty,"" the first minister will say.. ""At this election it is those principles that will guide my approach. So I am asking people to vote SNP to remove the Tories from government.. ""I'm asking people to vote SNP to put Scotland's interests first. I'm asking people to vote for a future made in Scotland, for Scotland."". Mr Swinney also highlighted what the he said the SNP had achieved in government, including:. Analysis by Phil Sim, BBC Scotland political correspondent. John Swinneyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s calculation is that a Labour win is already priced in for many in this election.. At his launch event, he predicted that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the Tories are on course for a huge defeat, a wipeoutï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. The pitch is that the Tories are toast anyway, and Labour will have a big majority - so Scots donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t actually need to vote for Labour to achieve that. Indeed, he says they should vote for the SNP to keep Labour honest - to hold their feet to the fire.. Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s painting them as already being complacent - ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½they think Scotland is in the bagï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. The question is whether this message - that people can have a Labour government without actually voting Labour - will cut through with voters, compared to the rather more straightforward ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½changeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ narrative Sir Keir Starmer is selling.. Speaking on BBC Scotland's Tilton said his party was not talking about independence during this campaign ""because literally no-one on the doorsteps is talking about it - they donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"".. He added: ""We donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t believe there should be a second referendum ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not salient to p""People want to talk about getting access to a GP at the first time of asking, or NHS dentists in their locality.. ""They want to talk about taking the sewage out of our rivers and lifting up Scottish education to where it used to be."". Speaking on the campaign trail in Renfrew, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the SNP had spent the entire campaign so far attacking Labour when the real opportunity was to ""get rid of this rotten Tory government"".. He said: ""Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s what weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re focused on ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ getting rid of Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman and the whole, rot""People across Scotland realise after 14 years of corruption, chaos, lies and sleaze from the Conservative party that this is Scotlandï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s opportunity to get rid of them. And the only way we do that is if we elect a UK Labour gover"". Mr Sarwar said he was confident previous SNP supporters would switch to Labour on 4 July.. ""I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t care how you voted in the past. I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t care how you voted in the referendum. I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t care how you would possibly vote in fut""What I care about just now is getting rid of this rotten Tory government, so letï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s go on this part of the journey together and change our co"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr Swinney had made ""a desperate attempt"" to relaunch the SNPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s election cam""in the wake of his shameful mishandling of the Michael Matheson scandal"".. Mr Matheson - a former health secretary - was last week handed a record ban from parliament for breaching Holyrood's expenses policy. . And police are now assessing a new complaint over the SNP MSP's ï¿½ï¿½11,000 iPad data roaming bill.. Douglas Ross said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Predictably, he (Mr Swinney) used it to double down on the SNPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s independence obsession, instead of focusing on the peopleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s real priorities ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As he showed in the Matheson scandal, John Swinney wil"". Mr Ross added: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Voters who have had enough of SNP incompetence and their endless sowing of division have the chance to punish them on Jul""In key seats across the country, only the Scottish Conservatives can beat the SNP and move the focus on to the issues that really matter.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

bbc.com,Labour plans apprenticeship funding shake-up,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511058gzdpo,2024-06-01 21:31,"Labour is promising to give businesses more flexibility over how they spend government money currently earmarked for apprenticeships if they win the July election.. Shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson says the party will allow businesses to use up to 50% of the cash provided by the government to fund apprenticeships or training for existing staff.. Labour previously outlined the plan to ""tackle skills shortages"" but the announcement gives more detail on how it hopes it would work in practice.. It comes after the Conservatives said they would scrap some university courses to fund more apprenticeships.. The Conservative Party said Labourï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s proposa""ill thought through"".. Apprenticeships are partly funded by money raised through taxes, as well as through an ""apprenticeship levy"" paid by bigger businesses with an annual wage bill of more than ï¿½ï¿½3m.. Those firms, as well as smaller businesses, can then use that money to train apprentices.. Labour's plans for what it has terme""growth and skills levy"" involve giving businesses the choice to spend up to half of the money they receive to train existing staff in ""high-level technical skills"" such as retrofitting or engineering.. Under the plans, employers could also offer ""pre-apprenticeship training"" courses to prepare people for full apprenticeships or jobs.. A minimum of 50% of the money from the levy would still be reserved for apprenticeships.. They say that any courses will need to be from an approved list of essential skills, which could include areas like digital and green skills, social care or childcare and that businesses would not be able to use it on internal training such as HR or health and safety.. Labour said that if businesses used just 3% of the additional flexibility, it could generate 150,000 traineeships for young people.. Bridget Phillipson said the plans would create a ""golden age of lifelong learning"".. She added: ""Labour will put businesses in the driving seat of creating the opportunities people need to get on in work."". A spokesperson for the party said they had no plans to increase the levy.. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said Labour's plans would halve the number of apprenticeships and disadvantage small and medium-sized businesses.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Since 2010, we have built a world-class apprenticeship system from the ground up... creating pathways to 70% of occupations through apprentice"" . The Liberal Democrats said its own plans involved giving every adult a ""pot of money"" over their working life to spend on education and retraining.. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that in order for apprenticeship plans laid out by any party to be a success, more businesses need to be convinced to take up the funding available.. Imran Tahir, a Research Economist at the IFS, said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Both main parties have now set out aspirations to increase the number of employees - and especially young employees - in training or apprenticesh""Ultimately, employers will decide how to use the funding, and presently many are choosing not to take up the funding that is available. . ""If these new programmes are to benefit the youngest employees, either party would have to convince employers shift their current patterns, which see nearly half of apprenticeships funded by the levy being taken by employees aged 25 and up."". David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said the plans were a ""good first step"" in transforming the current apprenticeships levy which, he says, ""has not delivered for young people"".. He added: ""I would like to see more commitment to grow training and skills funding in colleges for those adults who need to learn in a rapidly changing world. . ""Without an urgent and significant growth in opportunities in colleges, millions of adults risk being left behind as technology changes."". According to the IFS, average employer spending on training has fallen by 27% in real terms since 2011, and public spending on adult education and skills is down 31% over the same period.. The number of adults on further education courses has declined by around 50% since 2010, from roughly 3.5 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2023.. The number of people completing apprenticeships has also fallen in recent years.. In England, 54.6% of apprentices completed and passed a final assessment in 2022-23, which is far below the government's 67% target by the end of 2024-25.. A report by the Department for Education in March 2022 suggested that four in 10 people who did not complete their apprenticeships cited personal reasons such as mental health issues, caring responsibilities or career changes. . However, about four in 10 also said that the apprenticeship was badly run, they were not given enough time for training or that it did not meet their expectations.. There are no UK-wide figures for the number of apprentices, but there were 752,200 in England in 2023, which is higher than during disruption from the Covid pandemic, but lower than in the mid-2010s..

bbc.com,Labour's long war inflicts Starmer's first campaign stumble,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7220exjzvno,2024-05-31 23:04,"ýýýWeýýýll have to take them apart, piece by piece.ýýý. A former Labour cabinet minister almost spat the words out in anger. I have never forgotten that conversation, even though it was nearly 10 years ago, because their fury was so hot, coming off them in waves.. The senior politician who was spitting chips in the summer of 2015 was apoplectic that the Left had propelled their man, Jeremy Corbyn, to Labourýýýs top job.. They were frustrated that Ed Miliband had allowed thousands of new Labour Party members to flood in, paying only ýý3 to join up, many of whom had gone on to elect Mr Corbyn leader. They were also depressed at the prospect of having to go through, as he saw it, the long, painful process of dismantling the Left all over again.. Memories of election drubbings in the 1980s and late-night party meetings in crowded rooms above South London pubs, as he and his allies battled to take the Left apart ýýýpiece by pieceýýý, were still raw.. This weekýýýs row over the future of Diane Abbott must be understood in the context of the decades-long battle for supremacy between different wings of the Labour Party.. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a fight between the radical flank on the left and those who believe their tradition is closer to the publicï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s heartbeat. History suggests the outcome of that battle can have a direct impact on their election results. The partyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s two worst defeats in modern times were under Michael Foot and Jeremy Corbyn, both from the left-wing tradition. Of course, there were particular circumstances in both cases.. Sir Keir Starmer may have been part of Mr Corbynï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s team but the Leftï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s power has waned under his leadership. He has sought to prise their fingers from the party machine and gain control, you might say, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½piece by pieceï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. But the latest piece of that process has resulted in a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½massive own goalï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, as one Labour source described it to me. It was widely thought that after a long career as the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, Diaarliament and an icon on the Left - would want to stand down from her seat at this general election.. Just after the election date was announced, she was brought back into the fold as a Labour MP after a long suspension over comments she made in a letter to a newspaper that were seen as antisemitic and also offensive to Irish and Traveller people.. Now, it was thought, she could depart politics with dignity, rather than being handed her P45. But all that changed when a newspaper report appeared suggesting she would be banned from standing even if she wanted to.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½She was looking for a way to stand down with dignity then it was blown all up,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ one shadow cabinet member told me.. Keir Starmer faced a backlash from the left of his party and others ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but repeatedly insisted she had not been banned ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and it would be up to Labourï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) to decide Ms Abbottï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fate.. . Listen to Laura read this piece: Labour's long war inflicts Starmey afternoon he tore up that position and declared that Ms Abbott was free to be a Labour candidate if she wanted to be.. This move threatens to give the impression that Sir Keir has picked a fight with the Left but wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t quite strong enough to win it.. The Tories have a shiny new attack line to hurl at Labour. And it has allowed the Labour left, who Starmer had kept at bay, to crow, with the campaign group, Momentum straight out of the blocks with a triumphant statement: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You come at the Queen you better not miss!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. It might have been preferable to back down publicly when he did, rather than allowing this row to run until Tuesday when the NEC was meant to make the final call.. A senior ally of the leader argued on Friday afternoon ""Everyone was aware of the symbolism. We had to to draw a line, it couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t just go on a"". But it is still not official that Ms Abbott will definitely be a Labour candidate in Hackney. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a messy, partial end to a fight the Labour leadership didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t need to have.. Whatever happens to Diane Abbott, the left-right argument has roared back, just as Labour should be hitting its campaigning stride.. There are public screams of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½purgeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, from parts of the Left and on some of the front pages. A senior union figure told me the leadership is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½using the chance to settle scores, it is obvious what is going on. It is a real power moveï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. But the official story from Team Starmer is that they are just trying to find the best possible candidates for the election. If that, by implication, means saying cheerio to some existing MPs, so be it.. But another Labour source told me: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Keir is more interested in competence than ideologyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ there is obviously a role for the left of the Labour Party but it has to be as part of a team rather"". The truth of what is going on?. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s perhaps a mixture of both.. The ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½blue suitsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ as they are sometimes nicknamed, the (mainly) youngish men who eagerly work for Keir Starmer, not surprisingly, do want to make sure that the party is standing candidates who will work hard and well, and once elected, will be part of the project, not push against them.. That has involved in some parts of the country imposing candidates on local parties, backing former party staffers and activists closely connected with Starmerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s team as the next MP.. Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.. But is it a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½purgeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, when so far only a small handful of former MPs have actually been blocked?. One experienced source on the Left tells me, there are ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½elements of a purge, but elements of the leader wanting to bring in a group of people who reflect what he wants and what he wantst simply jobs for the boys, it is also a more strategic objective to assist the general direction,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the source says.. But not everyone in the party is happy with that calm, gently critical analysis.. One former NEC member tells me: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Labour has had great left MPs throughout its history and theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve shut down that broad church.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The purge is not about change, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s about what has been said by the leaderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ they cannot let the Left get in the driving seat again.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Labour would argue there are valid reasons why left wingers such as Lloyd Russell Moyle and Faiza Shaheen have been barred from standing at the last minute. But that is not how these former candidates and their allies on the Left see it.. Others on the Left have seen their Labour careers ended. Most notably Jeremy Corbyn himself. He was suspended by the party in 2020 over his response to an inquiry into antisemitism in the party and will now stand for parliament as an independent.. The left leaning Mle forced by boundary changes. She was defeated by Gerald Jones, a shadow minister under Keir Starmerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s leadership.. And Jamie Driscoll, who won the 2019 North of Tyne mayor contest as a Labour candidate, was barred from standing for the party in 2024.. The way Diane Abbott has been treated stands in awkward contrast to the way a string of Tories, including Natalie Elphicke, Dan Poulter and Mark Logan, have been welcomed into Labour with open arms in recent weeks.. These arguments are happening in public at deafening volume because we are in a general election campaign, when Labour wants to be seen above all else as a sensible, credible force, and when many of the public will be taking a proper look at Keir Starmer for the first time.. The worst possible time to indulge in a big, fat ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and avoidable ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ row. The plight of Diane Abbott could have been decided many months ago. The indecision looks like ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the boys have treated her shabbilyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says one party source.. A member ofnly a few voters so far have brought the subject up on the doorstep, although they warn, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½you have to be careful how this "". One focus group conducted by the polling group More in Common on Thursday night reported the issue was raised unprompted by members of the public thinking about who to choose.. One voter switching from Conservative to Labour said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I worry if I was going to change from one party to another, would I trust somebody that's basically stabbing their own party member in the back?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. The group of voters it might concern the most, identified as the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½progressive activistï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ by More In Common, makes up about 12% of the voting public, the most left-wing portion.. Two thirds of them, by their calculation, chose Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, in 2019. That figure has already slid to a 60%, with evidence of many shifting across to the Greens.. The local election results already demonstrated thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s been a cost from Labourï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s position on Gaza, in terms of lost seats, and thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s been disappointment among some environmental activists at the party shifting on its plans, althns have been watered down.. The relief for Labour is that most of the voters who the so-called ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½purgeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ might upset live in big cities and student towns where they already rack up chunky majorities.. So perhaps discontent over candidate selection will not make much of a difference on polling day. There is an argument too, still made by the most enthusiastic advocates of Starmerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s efforts to distance himself from Jeremy Corbyn, that having a massive public barney with one of Mr Corbynï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s friends is evidence of how much the party has moved on.. But this argument may be too clever by half, in the context of a campaign where every vote matters.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Never buy into the idea that itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a masterplan,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says another Labour source, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½no one ever wants any public messiness - it doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t helpï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. And, as one senior Labour MP suggested to me, the risk is the public will not come away with the impression that Starmer is different to Corbyn, they will julso to attack the Tories for fighting amongst themselves.. Does this saga also risk Keir Starmer sowing bad seeds for the future?. A powerful figure in the Labour movement told me ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½some solid, middle of the road people are unhappy, people they need to keep their head when things get tough further on. There will be blowbackï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. Labour have been miles ahead in the polls for many months, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½they should just chill,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says another, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½they are more paranoid than they need to beï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s suggested by that source that provoking a row over the exit of a few of Jeremy Corbynï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fellow travellers is making the classic political mistake, fighting the last war.. If Keir Starmer is on the brink of Number 10, as the polls still suggest, maybe the logic of going after the remnants of the Corbyn regime is past its sell by date.. He has been fighting as Labour leader to show he is safe, different to the Tories but not too different. Promising change, but sensible and cre whoï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d previously chosen the Conservatives, to broaden the partyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s appeal.. But the next Parliament may well present him with a completely different political terrain, with less Tory pressure and more from the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½broader Leftï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, in his own party and from the Lib Dems, Greens, SNP and Plaid too.. Souring the atmosphere as the Abbott saga threatens to do may create an uneasy ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½impression of what the leadership is really prepared to do,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ as one source put it.. The fuss over one politician, Diane Abbott, is unlikely to change the result on 4 July.. Keir Starmer has successfully turned the Labour Party to concentrate on the country not its own woes, but the Abbott saga shows that internal disputes can snap back, exposing painful and ancient roots.. Political leaders have to establish their power over their parties and then demonstrate it to the public.. But wearing a party rosette is not the same as carrying blind faith in the leader - that  authority has to be proven anece by piece..

bbc.com,Lib Dems call for more Premier League games on free TV,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c900kqxw1lzo,2024-06-01 10:15,"The Liberal Democrats are pledging to make 10 English Premier League football matches per season free to watch on TV for everyone, if they win the election. . The party said the promise was in response to rising ticket prices and streaming subscription costs. . The Lib Dems said fans who wanted to watch games on TV may have to pay hundreds of pounds per year as games are split across different subscription streaming platforms including Sky Sports, TNT Sports and Amazon Prime Video. . But it is likely any change to existing arrangements would be subject to intense opposition from the Premier League and paid-for streaming platforms.. . The Lib Dems said its manifesto would promise to put 10 Premier League games back on free-to-air channels like the BBC and ITV, as well as 10 games from the Scottish Championship and 20 games from the English Football League, such as the Championship.. The party told the BBC to implement their plans they would amend the Broadcasting Act 1996, which gives the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport the power to draw up a list of sporting events which are in the ""national interest"". . Broadcast rights to these events must be offered to the main free-to-air terrestrial broadcasters on ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½fair and reasonable termsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. . This would require the majority of MPs to back a change to the law. . However, in practice lobbying from the Premier League and streaming companies would be likely to sway any political debate on this issue.. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Conservative government has completely failed football fans, from breaking their promise to create a football regulator, to allowing greedy broadcasters to hide Premier League football away from millions.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We need to tear down the paywall and give Premier League football back to the country. It is a scandal that the country is locked out of "". Plans to set up an independent football regulator, which would have the power to sanction clubs who break financial rules, were dropped after the surprise election announcement as there was not time to pass the new law. . A Conservative Party spokesman said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Liberal Democrats are just making things up at this point. They can't force TV companies to reduce subscription prices, or football clubs to make tickets cheaper, and the government remains committed to delivering the Independent Football Regulat""This is sad, desperate stuff from a party that people are struggling to take seriously."". The Labour Party has been approached for comment. . Parties are looking to shift ground ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and the key issue is economic growth. . From paddleboarding to waterslides, the party hopes their antics will get coverage for their policies.. Labour are making a big push for farmers' votes in the traditionally Conservative countryside..

bbc.com,Prince William's role is changing - what does he really want to do with it?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggx4vnj43o,2024-06-01 23:41,"When Prince William presented the menï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s FA Cup trophy at Wembley last weekend, heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d have been forgiven for thinking how life can come at you fast - compared with when he appeared at the same fixture last year.. A year ago he was still in the summery afterglow of the Coronation, in which the Prince of Wales had played a central role, rather tenderly supporting his father the King. The pair had been seen joking together during rehearsals.. Fast forward to summer 2024 and there have been massive unexpected pressures. Within the quartet at the heart of the monarchy ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ King Charles, Queen Camilla, Prince William and Catherine ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ both the King and Princess of Wales have""There can't be too many people whose wife and father have been diagnosed with cancer so close together. It must feel as if he is in a lonely place at times,"" says royal commentator Richard Palmer.. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s meant that Prince William has focused much of his attention on looking after his wife and young family, understandably putting many of his other engagements on hold.. The need to avoid the politics of the UKï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s general election has meant even more of his plans being curtailed, including a visit that would have focused on tackling homelessness.. While the King has returned to work with a burst of energy, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s unavoidable that there will still need to be adjustments for his health. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s going to mean Prince William being pushed ever more clearly into the role of hei""It must feel like the weight of the world is on him. The future of the monarchy rests on his shoulders,"" says royal author Prof Pauline Maclaran.. It doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t help that thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s an ocean-wide gap between Prince William and his brother Prince Harry.. And swirling around the Princess of Walesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s illness, as she continues with cancer treatment, has been a toxic swamp gas of social media gossip and crazy speculation.. It must have felt as though the royal world, used to travelling at the sedate pace of a carriage, had turned into a white-knuckle ride.. At the centre of this storm, what does Prince William himself want to achieve? If you turn off all the background noise about the royals, what does he want to do with his role?. The key word, according to sources close to the prince, is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½impactï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Rather than ribbon-cutting, photo opportunities and easy gimmicks, he wants to deliver projects that make a tangible, measurable difference.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s asking: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½How can I use my platform for good, to create positive change,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says a royal source.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½He hat means his projects to reduce homelessness, promote mental health issues and support environmental business through his Earthshot project.. Prince William has described his role as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½social leadershipï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and his visits have been labelled as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½community impact daysï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a millennial vision of monarchy, taking off the tie and actively promoting a social agenda, with language that wouldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t be out of place in a campaigning charity.. A microcosm of his approach was seen last month, when the prince, now responsible for the Duchy of Cornwall, helped with the breaking of ground for a new health centre on the Isles of Scilly.. Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d worked with the local council to get this project at St Maryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Community Hospital under way.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½He's rolled up his sleeves and played a fundamental role in ensuring the work begins as soon as possible,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says a royal source, with the impact being that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½people don't have to go to the mainland for careï¿½ï¿½ended to reduce homelessness.. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not particularly glitzy. Campaigners against the monarchy once described the royals as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½state-funded reality televisionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but the type of projects Prince William has been backing are often much less glamorous or even media-friendly.. Maybe that fits with another part of his character. He doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t always take the easiest path.. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like his football team, Aston Villa. Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s described supporting the team as a deliberate decision not to back the boringly predictable usual winners. He preferred the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½emotional rollercoaster momentsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ of teams that went down as well as up.. Mind you, his father has gone a step further with this philosophical footballing ethos, supporting Burnley, who were relegated this year.. Prince Williamï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s approach also risks criticism.. The anti""crass and hypocritical... given the excessive wealth we gift him"".. There's also the accusation that any ambition to tackle housing problems will always ultimately depend on political interventions which are outside his remit.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a tall order and itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not entirely clear how heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s going to achieve it. But many people will think he should be applauded for trying,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Richard Palmer.. . Another nagging friction is the tension between Team William and Prince Harry and Meghan, who can almost seem like a rival Californian court. While William was digging away in Cornwall, they were getting the rock star treatment in Nigeria.. Prince William has the challenge of getting serious ideas across, when heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s caught up in an improbably scripted soap opera.. Thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s another generational pressure for Prince William that is only likely to increase.. A significant part of the public popularity of the monarchy now depends on the Prince and Princess of Wales. Theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re like politicians who are more popular than their party.. Thh that showed Prince William and Catherine as having approval ratings of over 70%, while support for the monarchy as an institution was at 56%.. Among younger people support for the monarchy is only 34% - and itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not until the over-50s that a majority see it in a positive way.. The significance of Prince William and Catherineï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s popularity is that it stretches across age groups and different regions, at a time when a significant minority are sceptical about the monarchy.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The monarchy has to be relevant and he wants to modernise it,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Prof Maclaran.. As heir to the throne, he will also have to look in the longer term to his own reign.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The next few years will see him thinking through what kind of monarch he wants to be and what kind of monarch the country will need to have in the mid-21st Century,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says historian Sir Anthony Seldon.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½He has been defining his own agenda, much of it overlapping with his fatherï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s interests and passions,ï¿½ï¿½ unknowns for Prince William, who has such a big public platform but now has to find his own voice..

bbc.com,Evan Davis: Successful entrepreneurs donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t worry about being dif,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gg58j2yd0o,2024-06-02 00:00,"You want to step out of the world of wage slavery, and set up a business of your own? Preferably a business that will be more than a mere lifestyle for you - one that you can sell and from which you can retire on the proceeds?. Well, in thinking about your chances of success, it helps to look at those who have trodden that path and ended up with a flourishing enterprise to their name.. In the interview series The Decisions That Made Me a Leader, we spoke to half a dozen successful entrepreneurs - too small a sample from which to draw statistically useful generalisations, but large enough to spot some interesting patterns.. I was struck by three intriguing attributes that may not guarantee business success, but which do seem to help.. First, I noticed the degree of rebelliousness exuded by several of them. They never quite fitted in - perhaps not into school, or university, or into the first jobs they tried.. Duncan Bannatyne, famous as one of the original big stars of the Dragons Den TV series, certainly never fitted into the navy, from which he was court-martialed and dishonourably discharged after getting into a fight with an officer. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I just thought it was right thing to do - he was poking me and shouting at me,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ recalls Mr Bannatyne.. His attitude, he tells me, is that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½authority should not be acceptedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. Simon Beckerman, founder of online marketplace Depop, draws a similar conclusion about himself. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I'm quite a disob"" he says. ""I think I am unemployable."". And itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s true that when you donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t find it easy to work for anyone else, going it alone is the obvious alternative career route.. Before she created the tea mixology brand Bird & Blend Tea Co, Krisi Smith had stumbled through many jobs - including cleaning out cat pens in a cattery (even though she is allergic to cats) and w""shot girl"" selling spirits to club-goers.. ""I was always asking questions and wanting to know why we were doing something and making suggestions,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she recalls. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½And I think that that tended to put peopl"" After seeing her employers treat staff and customers badly, she decided she wanted to run her own business ethically.. The second attribute that I noticed was a kind of impatience hard-wired into their personalities. It seems there is always an itch. They never stand still.. . But if you thought their success in business came out of some kind of life-plan upon about which they had reflected and consciously embarked, you would be missing the point.. These entrepreneurs grabbed at opportunities, and indeed grabbed opportunities to make opportunities for themselves.. Timo Armoo, who set up the social media marketing company FanBytes, says he started his first venture at school, charging other pupils to help them with their maths assignments. Then, at the age of 17, he managed to secure interviews with Sir Richard Branson, Lord Sugar and James Caan after emailing the organisers of a business summit and offering to set out chairs in exchange for a press pass.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I sent it and within 20 minutes I get back al saying, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You're crazy and yes, let's d"" recalls Mr Armoo.. The impatience that one can observe even extends to the entrepreneurs leaving the very businesses they created. Self-aware founders understand the skills they have and do not have, and know that when a business matures, it often needs a management that can do the painstaking work of delivering sustainable growth, rather than one with the flair of creation and discovery.. At that point, impatience is exactly the wrong attribute. And anyway, the entrepreneurs we spoke to, being impatient, are ready to move on once the business is solid, so their minds wander to selling.. Take Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of Lastminute.com at the height of the dot-com boom during the late 1990s. She was the poster child of a new youthful entrepreneurial culture that sprung up at that time, as kids showed the grown-ups exactly what the internet was capable of.. But at the age of 31, she made the decision to step down as managing director of the company. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It was like being in a pop band where you had thimega hit, and I didn't want that to be the only thing that defined my life,"" she says.. So to a third and final entrepreneurial attribute, which follows from the others: itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a willingness to actually do things, rather than merely think about them. Or overthink them.. I feel this is what marks out those people - in business or perhaps even in charities or public service - that are of a genuine entrepreneurial spirit. They are the people who seem to get things done.. Some of it comes down to a kind of optimism. They believe that their own actions have a good chance of achieving something, so they are less likely than most of us to descend into a fatalistic stupor. It gets them out of bed in the morning.. Richard Walker comes from a family with a track record in business - his father was the founder of the supermarket chain Iceland, where Richard is now executive chairman. But as a young qualified chartered surveyor, Richard ""I also had this entrepreneurial itch to do my own thing"".. He was advised by the legendary property developer Tony Gallagher to move to Poland. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½So I did, because they just joined the EU. They were the size of Germany, 40 million people, very well-educated. There were no Brits living out there full-time running a private property company. So I decided I "". Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve met a lot of entrepreneurs, and I sometimes wonder if they are deluded in their optimism. Many massively overrate their chances of success, and they often canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t even imagine the many things that may go wrong with the next idea they are toying with. They have too vivid a picture of what can go right.. But as delusions go, optimism is a blessing if you refuse to be daunted by the disappointments.. Of course, the far biggest attribute anyone in business needs is good luck. Things eventually worked out for all our guests and luck surely played a part in that.. We have not heard from the unknown names who tried to build a business, but whose efforts foundered. They may have had great judgement, business nous, all the right characteristics - but just hit the wrong product at the wrong time. That doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t have to have been their own fault. Things sometimes turn out bad. In business, they mostly turn out bad. . Entrepreneurs are not some kind of special breed. We all have our eccentricite and we all get things done. And we donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want to be fatalistic in thinking that you are either born with entrepreneurship or youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re not. The skills of business can be learned and developed to some extent.. But if you are asking yourself, whether you are cut out to venture into a life like those of the stars of our series, it is certainly worth examining the characters they have - the flaws that turn out to be strengths and the work they have put in..

bbc.com,Global tourism is booming. These people would rather it wasnï¿½ï,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl55vdjv2j3o,2024-05-31 00:28,"The message was scrawled on a makeshift wooden placard with black marker pen and was in block capitals. It said: ""Everywhere you look everyone is foreign.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Police said there were 10,000 marchers on the streets of Palma in Majorca on the last weekend of May at the start of the summer holiday season. Their message was that tourism was making life in Palma unliveable for locals.. But why does there suddenly seem to be such a strong sense of grievance in places where for decades large numbers of tourists have been the norm?. The answer, it would seem, is complicated. A Covid hangover is definitely a factor. But so too is the fact that, globally, many more people now have the money to travel. This presents big questions about the future of tourism.. The year 2024 is set to be a record-breaking one for tourism, surpassing the previous high in 2019. It appears that the travel and tourism industry is back with a vengeance after the pandemic, with any lingering doubts over the safety of travelling now banished.. In Spainï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Balearic Islands - which include Majorca - pent-up demand post pandemic has contributed to  to such an extent that locals say they are being priced out of living in their own home towns. The BBC has reported on the story of a chef in Ibiza who has lived in his car for the past three years. Nurses, doctors and police officers are also said to be struggling to afford local rents.. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not hard to see why locals can end up feeling like extras in their own movie.. In spite of recessionary pressures, more people in the West feel they can afford regular foreign trips ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ indeed, some see it as an essential purchase and a virtual human right.. The sentiment is similar around 1,500 miles away on the Canary Islands. They have been a favourite for Brits for decades and tourism has become a vital part of the economy. Today it accounts for 35% of the archipelagoï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s GDP and 40% of its jobs.. The cost of living for locals is an issue here too.. Chris Elkington is the editor of the local newspaper for English speakers, The Canarian Weekly. He started living in Tenerife in 1991 as an 18-30 hoseen tourism flourish over the years.. But with that unchecked growth comes a downside: rental prices are too high for many locals and the average income in the Canaries is the lowest in Spain. Many hospitality staff have been forced to move away.. Mr Elkington says a constant increase in tourist accommodation has come at a price.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½A lot of landlords are now very wary and are moving away from renting their properties out long term and turning to holiday lets via online platforms,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he says. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The actual number of properties available has decreased massively and the price has increased exponentially. And unfortunately it's made finding somewhere to live very, very expensive.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. But in the Canaries, affordability is not the only issue. The environmental impact of tourism is also viewed by some as increasingly unsustainable.. At a demonstration attended by 20,000 people at  the end of April, a spokesperson for the Canaries Have Had Enough collective said the situation has reached a e reached the point where the balance between the use of resources and the welfare of the population has broken down, especially over the last year.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Mr Elkington points to the fact that tourist areas with their large number of hotels and pools can use up to six times more water than resident areas.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½They keep building more hotels and expanding the area of tourism,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he says. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½But unfortunately the resources that are here can't actually cope with it.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. The Tourist Trap. . The travel industry is booming with millions more people holidaying abroad each year. How can we stop overtourism and protect the planet from its impact on the environment?. . Listen now on BBC Sounds. In the Italian city of Venice, a Unesco World Heritage site, school teacher Marta Sottoriva used to get into a small boat to block the huge cruise liners that regularly entered the city centre and offloaded thousands of day-trippers. That battle has been won - cruises are now restricted to the cityï¿½a wer than 50,000 people actually live in Venice, compared to more than 150,000 in the 1970s.. Despite the cruise ship ban, Ms Sottoriva is not happy. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I know a lot of people who even if they have money, they have an income, they canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t find houses,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she says.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We are at the level at which there are more tourist beds than there are beds for locals.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. The great danger of tourism is that an area is starved of a living flourishing mixed community with schools, local amenities and regular shops and instead becomes a historic theme park. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Disneyfiedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is the description used by a lot of protestors.. So what measures are being taken to counter overcrowding in popular destinations?. One approach is to try to regulate the flow of visitors at peak times. This can be done by charging admission fees for day-trippers and providing data to potential visitors as to when the busiest times to avoid will be. Venice has just introduced a trial ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½5 fee for day trippers historical attractions are raising their charges to tourists.. The new mantra being banded around by tourist boards is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½high value, low volumeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. This means catering to travellers who will spend a lot of money and are mindful of their presence in a fragile environment.. Another solution is to encourage people to avoid peak season travel and come in the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½shoulder seasonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Staggering school holidays could also prevent so many families descending on the same resort over an intense six-week period.. Many in the tourism industry also talk of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½dispersalï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. This means persuading tourists to go to alternative - similar, but less busy - destinations. Limiting car parking space is becoming a favoured approach to reduce the viability of coming just for day trips.. That doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t prevent tourist buses dropping off big groups, however. And it is hard to see how a tourist from, say South Korea, would not want to visit the Eiffel Tower and Venice, on their hard-earned firly in places that have been on the tourist trail for years that locals are feeling overwhelmed.. Hallstatt in Austria is an undeniably picturesque little lakeside Alpine village with a gorgeous panoramic view that could come out of a fairytale book. The common urban myth is that the town is the basis for Arendelle, the village in the hugely popular Disney movie Frozen.. I met a mother from South Korea who had brought her two young daughters dressed up as princesses for this very reason.. There are around 800 residents in Hallstatt who are simply dwarfed by the 10,000 or so daily visitors - many of whom descend from large tourist buses and proceed to walk around, sometimes through residents gardens, in search of the perfect selfie.. Some locals have had enough and last year a demonstration blocked the tunnel that leads road traffic into the town.. Dr Friedrich Idam, a long-time resident and urban architect, was one of them. He lives in a house on a hill that overlooks the lake. He told me that he doesnï¿½ï¿½irt tourists who only come for a day trip. He says they spend little money and have made life unbearable for him. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s no more public space for me and my co-inhabitants,ï¿½ï¿½ï""In the churchyard tourists take selfies and pose on the graves. The problem of Hallstatt is that it is so Instagrammable. If you come in your car and stay only for an hour, I say you are not welcome here.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. The mayor, Alexander Schuetz, is sympathetic but feels helpless: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Everybody knows itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s just too much but we canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t just block the street and tell people you canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t come in because itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a public right of way. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not a dead end because people go through Hallstatt going to other towns.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Last year there was a short lived plan to stop congestion at a famous ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½selfieï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ site by the local council who put up a fence to block that particular viewpoint. They had to take it down when too many residents complained it blocked their own view of their beautiful lake.. And then there is the emergence of new tourist markets with the disposable income and desire to explore the world as they have never been able to before.. Tourists from China firsation in the early part of this century. And an even bigger source of international tourism is supplanting them in terms of impact.. India is the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fastest-growing major economy and now has the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s largest population.  A burgeoning affluent middle class in a country of 1.4 billion people is splashing the cash on dream trips to distant destinations.. Last year, 27 million Indian tourists travelled internationally and thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s predicted to soar to 70 million by 2030. Indian airlines have placed orders for almost a thousand new aircraft in anticipation of a big rise in demand.. Deepti Bhatnagar, who started Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s first ever travel show in 2000, says social media has played a major role in fuelling demand for travel among Indians. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½They want to go to certain places to get the selfie or they think, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s one of the most photographed spots,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and they have to be there,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she says.. The vast majority of the Indian population cannot affy requires the tiny fraction of wealthy and even super-wealthy to enter the travel market and global figures are immediately significantly boosted. There are around 500 billionaires and a million millionaires in India. And many have expensive tastes.. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s striking that while most things in life are becoming ever-more expensive, short-haul flying remains very cheap, sometimes less than a round of drinks in the pub. Orders for new commercial planes around the world are soaring. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s estimated 3% to 4% of greenhouse emissions are caused by aviation and that figure is expected to rise as other industries go greener faster.. Meanwhile, there is an ethical conundrum to consider here - and with it a charge of hypocrisy. Many in the West, myself included, have enjoyed the fruits of the post-war travel boom, exploring far flung parts of the world without thinking of the unwanted consequences of mass tourism. So who are we now to preach to younger generations for whom gap years and backpacking are almof passage and indeed life enhancing experiences?. And who are we to lecture people from developing economies who can only now afford to do the same?. There appears to be no simple answer to who should be where and when, something nodded to by another of those placards back in Palma..

bbc.com,Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s PM says fascism is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½consigned to historyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Not e,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cljj4j84r9go,2024-05-30 05:01,"They line up in military-like formation: a thousand strong, most dressed in black, some with tattoos on shaved scalps.. At the spot in Milan where Sergio Ramelli, a far-right student, was killed almost 50 years ago by anti-fascists, a leader summons his battalion of loyalists to attention. He shouts ""camerata"", or ""brother-in-arms"", and Ramelliï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s name, as if delivering a roll-call. And then it comes: stiff right arms outstretched and raised, palms facing down, the fascist salute in the heart of Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s second city, and the crowd reply on the dead man's behalf w""Present! Present! Present!"". It's 2024, but this has frightening echoes of a century ago. While it may seem extraordinary to an outsider ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and it was staggering to me, watching it close up ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ it is not out of the ordinary in Italy, where commemorations of this type take place every year.. Italy's current government is led by the Brothers of Italy party, which has roots in post-war fascism. Its leader, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has said her movement has completely changed and it is clear her politics are not those of the people raising their arms in Milan. But some fear she and her party have not moved far enough away from their political origins and that what was once considered the extreme is becoming m""Fascism did not die in 1945 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ it was militarily defeated but it continued to live in the mind of many Ita"" says Paolo Berizzi, a journalist for the Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica. He has lived under 24-hour police protection for the past five years, after receiving threats from extremist groups. ""Italy has never truly come to terms with its past,"" he says.. It's now more than a century since the countryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, nicknamed Il Duce, or The Leader, swept to power. His totalitarian regime was marked by a brutal repression of all opponents, concentration camps and invasions abroad. Antisemitic laws persecuted Jews, and after Mussolini allied with Hitler's Germany, thousands were sent to their deaths during the Holocaust. Italy capitulated to the Allies, plunged into civil war and Il Duce was eventually captured and killed.. The countryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s post-war constitution banned Mussolini's fascist party, but the movement was allowed to continue in different guises. The Movimento Sociale Italiano, or MSI, was set up by the dictator's supporters with the aim of reviving fascism and fighting communism. Officials from Mussolini's regime took jobs in state institutions. Not a single Italian was brought before war crimes tribunals.. A 1952 addition to the constitution, called the Scelba Law, prohibited groups that pursued anti-dem, glorified the principles or leaders of fascism, or used violence in its service. But it has rarely been invoked. In Germany, the law is clear that making the fascist salute is punishable by up to three years in prison. In Italy, however, it is left up to judges to decide whether the gesture is a criminal offence: a grey area that means its use has continued.. For decades, neo-fascist politicians were largely sidelined. But the decision by then-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to bring them into his coalition in 1994 marked the start of their growing legitimisation in public opinion.. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose political life began in the MSI youth wing and was the national leader of its successor movement, once praised Mussolini as ""a good politician"", adding that ""everything he did, he did for Italy"". In 2008, Mr Berlusconi appointed her a government minister.. Ms Meloni's Brothers of Italy party bears the same three-coloured flame logo adopted by neo-fascist groupings after the war, but she has progressively shifted her movement away from the far right.. Her previous rhetoric against ""ethnic substitution"" of Italians by migrants, and a supposed ""LGBT lobby"", has softened since her election as Prime Minister in 2022. She now uses language more aligned with the mainstream European right, such as talk of protecting borders and boosting Italy's birth rate.. She has dropped her criticism of the Eurozone, has formed close relationships with leaders from Washington to Brussels, and has been forthright in her support for Ukraine after its invasion by Russia. But her critics say she still winks to her political roots.. And that, some believe, makes her even less likely to support a crackdown on extremist groups. Many feel the Scelba law should have been applied in 2021, after the headquarters of Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s main trade union, CGIL, was violently attacked during a protest against Covid restrictions by a crowd that included members of Forza Nuova, a fringe far-right party. Demonstrators smashed windows and tried to force themselves into the building in a move reminiscent of Mussoliniï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s era, when the unions were attacked by his blackshirt mobs.. Forza Nuova, whiaround for more than a quarter of a century, is much further to the right than Ms Meloniï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s party, advocating a total halt to immigration, and leaving NATO and the EU. Its members speak warmly of Vladimir Putin.. The party has never attracted enough votes to have MPs elected to parliament but its visibility in protests and the actions of its members, including violence against immigrants, make it and other extremist groups a thorn in the side of Italian politics. At a recent funeral, a member's coffin was draped in a swastika flag. The birthday of another official was celebrated with a cake decorated by a swastika and the Nazi s""Sieg Heil"".. Forza Nuovaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s founder, Roberto Fiore, tells me the party attacked CGIL because the union had backed mandatory Covid vaccination certificates for all wor""Everyone thought of us as real freedom fighters, not fascists attacking a trade union,"" he claims.. I challenge him directly: Is he a fascist? ""If you asked me like that, I probably would say yes,"" he replies, ""but I have to complete the term and say Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m a revolutionary. Italy hasn't got the intelligence and the courage to say, well OK, fascism was good on this and that and maybe not good in other thingsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I accept, I don't refuse the term"". Over the course of our interview, I push Mr Fiore on the criminal nature of Mussoliniï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s regime. He denies it was violent, and claims that fascist internment camps""things that happen with war"". He goes on to say that Ukraine should be part of Russia. When I put it to him that his party would be banned in countries such as Germany, he says: ""Freedom is freedom."". Out of the Shadows: Awaking Italy's Past. Mark Lowen explores whether the extreme is becoming mainstream. Watch on the BBC News channel at 13:30 on Saturday 1 June.. Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK only). . At Forza Nuova's local headquarters in the northern city of Verona, the walls are draped in racist and extremist symbols, from the US Confederate flag, to those of the self-declared pro-Russian Donetsk and Luhansk Peopleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Republics, along with scarves bearing the ""White Power"" and ""We are fascists - a call to arms"". The partyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s deputy leader, Luca Castellini, proudly shows me a Mussolini calendar, which he claims is the most-sold calendar in Italy.. He also heads up Veron""Ultras"" - hardcore football fans. Italian stadiums have long been breeding grounds for political extremism. When the club, Hellas Verona, was promoted six years ago, Mr Castellini was filmed shouting jubilantly to supporters that the person who had paid for their success and gifted them victory had a name: ""Adolf Hitler!"" The fans cheered and began their own chant: ""Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re a fantastic team in the shape of a swastika. How great it is to be trained by Rudol"" - Hitlerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s deputy. Mr Castellini was banned from the stadium after claiming that a black player could nev""truly Italian"".. When I confront him on all this, he says he would happily repeat the same Hitler chant, because it was ruled not to have been a crime. How would a descendant of Italian Jews deported to the Holocaust feel, I ask? ""I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know - but wars have always existed and there have always been d"" he replies. ""It canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t be my pr"". Ms Meloniï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s party has distanced itself from Forza Nuova. The prime minister condemned the sacking of the trade union building and Forza Nuovaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s leaders openly criticise her for some of her positions, including her steadfast support for Ukraine.. And before the election, she sought to reassure critics by releasing a video message in which she said the Italian right had ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½consigned fascism to historyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and vigorously condemned the suppr""ignominious anti-Jewish laws"".. However, Ms Meloni has not discarded her heritage entirely: she still uses the fascist-era slogan ""God, homeland, family"", for example.. ""Brothers of Italy is not a fascist party ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but it is an ideological heir to the post-fascist trad"" says journalist Paolo Berizzi. Extremist groups feel legitimised by this, Mr Berizzi adds.. Brothers of Italy is riding high in the opinion polls ahead of the upcoming European elections, way ahead of any other Italian party. If, as is expected, her grouping of European right-wingers makes resounding gains in the vote, she will entrench her political dominance in Italy and her position as a figurehead for other right-wing and far-right politicians aiming to lead their own countries.. Her critics point to the fact that she has never directly called herself an ""anti-fascist"". But Nicola Procaccini, a Member of the European Parliament with Brothers of Italy and one of Ms Meloniï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s oldest political allies, insists thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a good reason""Being anti-fascist during fascism was a very brave act, for freedom and democracy. But being anti-fascist during democracy has sometimes meant violence, and a lot of young students killed,"" he says, referring to often bloody clashes between extremist groups, and murders carried out in Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s post-war decades.. He insists sheï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s always condemned fascism - but hits out at wh""an obsession"" with the term, which he claims is whipped up by the left to scaremonger before elections.. That's vigorously denied by opponents in places like Bologna, historically the heart of anti-fascism. On the wall of the city hall are the black and white photos and names of those who died defending Bologna from fascism during the civil war of 1943-45. Beside it is another memorial, for the 85 victims of Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worst terror attack: the bombing in 1980 of Bolognaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s train station by neo-fascists.. Emily Clancy, the city's deputy mayor, says the fight against fascism is still profoundly rele""The far right, not only in Italy, but also around the world, is trying to find a scapegoat for people's difficulties by attacking the stranger or the migrant,"" she says. There are similarities with the early days of fascism, she says, pointing to ""attacks on the freedom of the press, censorship, freedom for the LGBT community and attacks on the liberty of women to determine what they can do on their own bodies"".. I ask whether she and her side are losing to the far right, which is making advances across the world. ""I think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a struggle - we havenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t lost, but definitely we have to unite and not take for granted what i"" she replies.. And what of the fascist salutes that still crop up so regularly in demonstrations? ""Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s incredible that this ha"" she adds, ""and that what should be seen as a crime of apology of fascism is downplayed as just nostalgic, or a tribute. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re not addressing the gravity of these episodes as we s"". However, Nicola Procaccini, the MEP, says banning the gesture would be ""crazy"", adding that itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not a call to re-introduce fascism, but a historical gesture derived from Ancient Rome - though it is one that was later adopted by the fascist re""This is cancel culture that we do not share."". And so the symbols live on - as does the belief among some that the established narrative needs rewriting. In Predappio, the birthplace of Benito Mussolini, a pilgrimage of sorts takes place every year on the anniversary of his death, where participants in military berets and clutching red roses visit his tomb.. Susanna Cortinovis, one of the mourners, praises Mussolini for introducing social security and maternity payments. ""If youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re telling me that being a mother, a Christian, paying my taxes - does that mean Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m a fascist, then yes, Iï¿½"" she says. ""And I salute, in my Roman way, my one and only head of state."". Many countries have their nostalgists, their revisionists, their conspiracy theorists - and Italy is no exception. The numbers of Duce devotees are perhaps few. But there is crossover between Mussolini propagandists and modern neo-fascists. In a society that still tolerates such ideas, images, and beliefs, the question is how much this is becoming normalised - at a time when right-wing parties elsewhere in Europe are looking to Italy as an example.. ""Fascists have always nurtured a desire for revenge,"" says the journalist Paolo Berizzi. ""And they say: 'Very well, we return to power, we are not dead, we have not disappeared.' They pursue a revenge on history."". BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

bbc.com,Burrow was sporting great and inspiring MND campaigner,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/articles/crggwy1wp96o,2024-06-02 19:16,"This video can not be played. Rob Burrow was a Super League star before becoming an MND campaigner. A champion on and off the field, the determination, courage and humility of Rob Burrow guaranteed a legacy that stretches way beyond the sport he loved.. At 5ft 5in, Burrow was among the smallest men in rugby league, but he became one of its biggest names.. Father, family man, friend, competitor, campaigner. His death aged 41 comes nearly five years after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.. When Burrow learned of his illness, he told his wife Lindsey: ""Thank God it's me and not the kids."". His stoic resilience helped to transform the profile of this condition. His moving story was brought to millions by the BBC Breakfast team who became friends.. Decorated for his talents, Burrow played 492 times for Leeds Rhinos, won eight Grand Finals, three World Club Challenges and two Challenge Cups, as well as 15 England and five Great Britain caps.. Rugby league legend Burrow dies aged 41. Tributes paid to Rob Burrow following death at 41. A mural was painted on the side of Leeds Beckett University's Student Union to honour Rob Burrow. With his slight frame and diminutive stature, Burrow always stood out among the hulks of the modern rugby league game, from his junior days right through to the elite.. What he lacked in size, he made up for in devastating speed, evasiveness and skill, and he honed his tackling technique to enable him to compensate when it came to felling far bigger opponents.. One moment which best summed up his qualities was his try in Leeds' 2011 Grand Final win against St Helens, when having stepped off the bench at hooker, he ducked through the line and in full flight stepped his way past international full-back Paul Wellens to score a remarkable solo effort.. There was also the emotion of his final game in 2017, when he and long-time friend Danny McGuire - two members of Leeds' oft-referred 'golden generation' - bowed out together with Grand Final success at Old Trafford against Burrow's hometown club Castleford.. Rob Burrow (right) lifts the Super League trophy with Danny McGuire following Leeds' Grand Final win over Castleford in 2017 - their final game for the club. On Burrow's retirement that year, Leeds head coach Brian McDermott said: ""Rob will be remembered as one of the greats of our game, not just in the Super League era but throughout the history of the sport."". He initially continued to work in rugby league after hanging up the boots, helping to develop the next generation at Headingley with the club he loved.. It was his resolve and positive outlook after his career ended that brought this unique character to a wider audience.. Burrow revealed he had been diagnosed with MND in December of 2019. There is no cure.. He would gradually lose his ability to talk, to move, and to breathe easily.. ""It's heartbreaking,"" consultant neurologist Dr Agam Jung told a BBC documentary on Burrow.. ""You may not be able to speak, you may not be able to swallow, you may not be able to breathe independently, you have weakness in your arms and legs. This leads to dependency and a reduced life span."". This video can not be played. How Rob Burrow's life changed after his diagnosis - from Rob Burrow: Living with MND. Burrow married his childhood sweetheart Lindsey in 2006 and the couple had three children together.. ""He always says, 'find somebody else, you're still young',"" Lindsey said in the documentary, discussing the prospect of a future without her husband. ""There will never be anyone else. No-one can ever take Rob's place."". His parents, Geoff and Irene, would help to feed Burrow.. Alongside looking after children Macy, Maya and Jackson and working as a physio in the NHS, Lindsey was effectively his primary carer - her love shining through during the difficult days since his diagnosis.. ""Yes, it is sad, but it is a story full of love, hope and optimism,"" she said.. Burrow lost weight and could not kick a ball with his son or change a nappy, but he retained his spirit despite losing his independence.. A little smile. A defiant thumbs-up. ""My mind is so strong and positive,"" he would say via a speech recognition tool which used recorded samples of his voice.. He joined others including former rugby union player Doddie Weir and footballer Stephen Darby in raising awareness and was brutally honest about the effects of the condition.. ""I'm a prisoner in my own body,"" Burrow said. ""The lights are on, but no-one's home. I think like you, but my mind doesn't work right. I can't move my body."". This video can not be played. Rob Burrow's mother Irene with her son - from Rob Burrow: Living with MND. Burrow, together with family and friends, wanted to raise funds and awareness around a disease which affects around 5,000 people in the UK.. ""It's like a game in a way. We are here to try to beat MND and the only way we are going to win is by collective effort,"" said Weir, who died in November 2022.. Despite his illness, Burrow remained relentlessly positive.. ""Whenever you're around Rob, there's love, there's laughter, there's jokes, usually at my expense or some other big bloke,"" said former team-mate Barrie McDermott.. ""What he lacked in size, he more than made up for in his wit and sharpness."". Lindsey would help him into a swimming pool. It was the only way he could walk without suffering debilitating pain in his joints.. Burrow would joke: ""I know when you get married you say, 'in sickness and in health'. I did not think she signed up to look after me so soon."". Kevin Sinfield (right) has raised millions of pounds for motor neurone disease since his former Leeds team-mate's diagnosis. An appeal was launched to raise ï¿½ï¿½5m to build a Rob Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease in Leeds.. One of the prominent fundraisers was Kevin Sinfield, Leeds captain for the bulk of Burrow's playing career. They met when Burrow was 12 and a heartwarming friendship was formed.. When Sinfield ran seven marathons in seven days in December 2020, there was a poignant moment when he spied Burrow and family. The deep bond was clea""To see what he's had to go through has been really difficult. Rob was a champion on the field and an incredible friend,"" said Sinfield.. As a child, Burrow was told he was too small to make it as a player. It turned out his impact was bigger than anyone could have imagined.. ""I have a disease with no cure but I have too many reasons to live,"" he said of his life-limiting illness. ""I am not giving in until my last breath."". In December 2019, he was told he may have a year to live, two at most. He defied all the expectations.. This video can not be played. Burrow scores sensational try against St Helens.

bbc.com,Can South Africa's ANC reinvent itself after dismal election result?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpeel805l49o,2024-06-02 11:13,"Mavuso Msimang read the writing on the wall last year and now the people of South Africa have confirmed what he saw.. The veteran of the African National Congress (ANC) resigned from the party in December after 66 years, citing endemic corruption, and warning that the ANC was on the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½verge of losing powerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. The party has lost the position of unrivalled political power itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s held since the end of apartheid 30 years ago, with a sharp drop in support.. As South Africans digest a pivotal moment in their history, they are looking back at what this means for the former liberation movement, and forward to what it means for the future of the country.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I think all of us can agree it's about time we have change,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Lerato Setsiba, a computer science student at Johannesburgï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s University of Witwatersrand.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½But I think a majority of the people at the moment, weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re quite scaredï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ we don't know what's going to happen.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Mr Msimangï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s er ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a life-size painting of Nelson Mandela, a coffee-table book bearing his name.. Mr Msimang served in the ANCï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s armed wing uMkhonto weSizwe in the 1960s and was appointed to several government positions after the 1994 elections that brought the movement to power.. Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s now the deputy president of the ANC veterans league, which has strongly advocated for action against corruption in the partyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ranks.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There was always a tendency to not deal with issues of accountability,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he says, but the economic mismanagement that resulted ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½affected people very directlyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½When I saw those long queues [of voters] which are almost similar to what happened in 1994, I didn't think that they were queuing to celebrate the ANC. It became very clear to me that something bad is coming.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m very disappointed,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he told me. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know how the ANCï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s legacy will be retrieved. I hope this is not forevtion legacyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ - the ANCï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s leading role in overthrowing white-minority rule.. They also remember its progressive social welfare policies that lifted millions of black families into the middle-class and expanded basic services such as water, electricity and welfare to millions more.. But the party began to attract people interested in power and political patronage. . Its downfall really began under former President Jacob Zuma, who resigned in disgrace amid allegations heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d allowed business associates to infiltrate government ministries. He denies the allegations.. Mr Zuma was replaced by Cyril Ramaphosa, who has been accused of not taking strong enough action to root out corruption from the party.. Nevertheless Mr Msimang, has not given up on the ANC, which his veteran comrades convinced him to rejoin.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I don't think all is lost. There is time for the ANC to regroup,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Mr Msimang.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½But the renewal of the ANC would take the form of making sure that elements whm the organization. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve really failed to act decisively to do that - we have not heeded the pleas of the people.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Nevertheless, Mr Msimang is worried about the absence of a strong alternative to the party: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There is this fragmentation, which is going to leave the country very unstable if this persists.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. At the elections results centre near Johannesburg the numbers tick up on a dashboard tracking the vote-count. . Its giant screen towers over a hall crowded with journalists, party officials and analysts such as Susan Booysen. She found a quiet place to speak with me.. The topic is coalition politics, which South Africa has not had at the national level for two decades. Though the ANC is still by far the largest party, it will need to share power in order to continue governing.. The political landscape is tricky, and fraught with consequences because the major parties have different visions for the country.. The pro-business Democratic Alliance is not an easy fit because of id its reputation as a party for the white community and other minority groups.. The next two biggest parties are on the radical left. Mr Zuma's new uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) - a name it adopted from the ANC's military wing - and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). They talk about seizing white-owned land and nationalizing mines and banks.. The ANC regards the EFF as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½too erratic in its orientation, too in your face, and too unreasonable in its policy demands,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Ms Booysen.. And thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s too much ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½bad bloodï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ between the ANC and MK, which has said it wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t partner with the ANC as long as Mr Ramaphosa remains its leader.. Unseating Mr Ramaphosa is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the MK party's main objective at this stage, and the ANC is collateral damage in that process as far as they are concerned,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she says.. Mr Zumaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s comeback, despite presiding over a decade of rampant corruption, has thrown a wildcard into the mix. He swept into the convention centre on Saturday nigme of whatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s expected to be turbulent coalition talks could decide between two very different directions for South Africa.. On the campus of Wits University, a troupe of student actors is performing a pop-up parody of the election.. People turned out in large numbers to vote here - many of them, like medical student Nobuhle Khumalo, for the first time.. Sheï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s excited about change but doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know what it means: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re just going to see what it looks like as it unfolds.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re chatting on the grounds in front of the library with two of her friends, Mr Setsiba and music student Silka Graetz.. They hope a coalition government will bring more accountability and transparency, but are wary it might result in greater political instability and dysfunction.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I think the increase of votes with other parties definitely creates a healthy competition,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Ms Graetz.  . ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½And I think with healthy competition comes better service, just an imp of whom did not experience apartheid, were more willing than their parents to abandon the ANC, powered by concerns about their future. . Some 45% of South Africaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s youth are unemployed, the highest recorded rate in the world.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½When itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s campaign time youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re not speaking to issues that concern young people,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Mr Setsiba, criticizing government budget cuts to education in recent years. . ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Pour funds into universities, stimulate entrepreneurship, and make it a thriving country for new businesses!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Ms Graetz warns that it will be important to restore investor confidence in the country in order to improve the economy.. Both she and Mr Setsiba are preparing to graduate, so launching into the job market is at the top of their minds.. Ms Graetz is acutely aware that her future will be formed in the next four or five years, the time period before the next election.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The one question I have is: 'How long we have to wait to see something [change]?'pude shift. How much longer until that's put into action?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. It took 30 years for the ANC to be held to account for its failures. South Africaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s younger generation is not prepared to wait that long.. . President Ramaphosa says the result was a victory for democracy, but the ANC lost its majority for the first time.  .

bbc.com,Mexicans vote in election likely to see first woman president,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4475gwny1o,2024-06-02 20:19,"Mexicans are voting in an election which is almost certain to see the country's first female president elected. . Both the front runner, Claudia Sheinbaum, and her main rival, Xï¿½ï¿½chitl Gï¿½ï¿½lvez, are far ahead in the polls of the only male candidate, Jorge ï¿½ï¿½lvarez Mï¿½ï¿½ynez.. Voters will also elect all members of Mexico's Congress and governors in eight states, as well as the head of Mexico City's government.. The campaign has been overshadowed by violent attacks, which the government says have resulted in more than 20 local candidates being killed across Mexico, although private surveys put the total at 37.. Two people were reported killed in two attacks on polling stations in the state of Puebla on Sunday, officials said.. Ms Sheinbaum, a 61-year-old scientist who served as mayor of Mexico City from 2018 to 2023, has the backing of the outgoing president, Andrï¿½ï¿½s Manuel Lï¿½ï¿½pez Obrador.. Mr Lï¿½ï¿½pez Obrador, who has been in power since 2018, cannot run for the top office again, as undesidents are limited to a single six-year-term.. The popular leader - recent polls suggested he had an approval rate of close to 60% - has instead thrown his weight behind Ms Sheinbaum, who is part of his Morena party.. While many of the promises President Lï¿½ï¿½pez Obrador made upon taking office have remained unfulfilled, his efforts to reduce poverty and help elderly Mexicans have been popular with beneficiaries of these social programmes. . Having the backing of the president may have considerably widened Ms Sheinbaum's base of voters, but it has also raised questions about how independent she is of the sometimes overpowering leader.. Ms Sheinbaum has stressed that she is very much her own woman, while at the same time promising to continue building on what she says are Mr Lï¿½ï¿½pez Obrador's many achievements. . Their party, Morena, boasts about how millions of Mexicans have been lifted out of poverty during the past six years. . Morena says the number of people living in poverty is dwindling thanks to cies, such as more than doubling the minimum wage. . But economists have pointed out that there are also other factors at play, such as a rise in remittances being sent by Mexicans living abroad to their friends and family at home. . Taking on Ms Sheinbaum at the polls is senator and businesswoman Xï¿½ï¿½chitl Gï¿½ï¿½lvez.. Ms Gï¿½ï¿½lvez, 61, was chosen by a broad coalition of parties who share a desire to put an end to the rule of the Morena party.. She and the Strength and Heart for Mexico coalition she is running for have been critical of the rise in violence the country has experienced in the run-up to the election.. Speaking at her closing rally, she told Mexicans that if they voted for her they""the bravest president, a president who does confront crime"".. And while she has repeatedly derided the strategy Mr Lï¿½ï¿½pez Obrador laid out at the start of his presidency, when he promi""hugs not bullets"" in the battle against crime, Ms Gï¿½ï¿½lvez has provided little detail as to how she would combat the powerful criminal groups which are behind much of the violence which is blighting the country. . She has said that she would offer better pay to the police and invest more in security in general. . But what has arguably made her more popular with voters critical of the outgoing president is her promise to strengthen institutions she says Mr Lï¿½ï¿½pez Obrador tried to weaken, such as the constitutional court and the National Electoral Institute.. Ms Gï¿½ï¿½lvez has accused Mr Lï¿½ï¿½pez Obrador of being authoritarian and of undermining Mexico's democratic institutions, calling""arrogant and overbearing"".. Polls close at 01:00 BST (18:00 local time) and the winning candidate will take office at the end of September.. . A video posted on social media claims to show Jon Benjamin aiming a weapon at another man, while looking down the rifle's sight.. Who is elected as Mexico's next president on Sunday will have repercussions on US-Mexico relations.. Polls show that immigration is a primary electoral concern for many voters ahead of the 2024 election. .

bbc.com,Young French leader's rise and Belgium's future existence: What to watch in EU elections,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0wwepv5l6xo,2024-06-01 23:31,"When Europeans vote in elections for the European Parliament this coming week, their choices will reflect the national mood in 27 different countries.. Right and far-right parties are set to make gains, but the picture is widely different across the continent. Here is a snapshot of what to expect from BBC correspondents ahead of the vote.. Hugh Schofield in Paris. The main point of suspense in France is how big will be the victory of the far right under its 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella.. President Macron is certain to take a thumping. The question is whether his Renaissance party can limit the damage by at least retaining second place.   . It is far from a given, with the Socialists under a strongly performing Raphaï¿½ï¿½l Glucksmann snapping at the heels of Macronï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s little-known champion Valï¿½ï¿½rie Hayer. In the polls, they are each at about 15% or thereabouts, while other parties are hovering a little above the 5% cut-off, below which they will return no MEPs at all.. Meanwhile, Jordan Bardeal Rally are consistently polling at 32% plus -  more than double their nearest rivals.. The far right also won the last European elections in France in 2019, but by only a tiny lead over President Macronï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s party.. This time it looks like being a crushing victory. Clearly many voters who want to give a kicking to the president think that the most effective way is to choose the far right. Any inhibitions that might have checked that vote in the past have all but vanished.. Bruno Boelpaep in Brussels. Most Belgians have no idea whether the election posters are after their vote at a European, federal or regional level. Because on 9 June, Belgians are electing MPs for seven different parliaments.. Only one vote has got the country talking. And it's not the European election but the federal vote, because the future of Belgium might well be at stake in Flanders, the Flemish north. . To be able to govern and choose a prime minister, Flemish and French-speaking parties will have to form a coalition at the fedevel.. However, all the polls indicate that far-right party Vlaams Belang will come first. It wants the independence of Flanders and therefore the end of Belgium.. Until now, the traditional parties have kept a pact to keep it out of the ruling coalition. But as the prospect rises of Vlaams Belang coming first, so does the pressure on the other parties to let them have a seat at the table.. Adam Easton in Warsaw. Polling suggests Russiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine is the issue over the last decade that has most changed the way Poles see the future.. That may explain why Polandï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s centrist, pro-EU prime minister Donald Tusk has made national security and Russiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s threat the number one issue in his election campaign.. Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s trying to break a run thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s seen the Eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party win the last nine elections, including Octoberï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s parliamentary and Aprilï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s local elections, although PiSï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s lack of coalition partners saw it lose parties are keen to get their core voters out. . For PiS, that means playing on fears of abandoning the Polish zloty for the euro, rising energy prices and the impact of the EUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s climate policies on farmers. . Opinion polls put Donald Tuskï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Civic Coalition and PiS way out in front, tied on around 30% each.. Rob Cameron in Prague. Slovaks vote next Saturday amid a strange, muted and at times tense atmosphere that has descended on their country since the assassination attempt on Prime Minister Robert Fico.. The centre-right opposition immediately suspended campaigning after the 15 May  shooting, when Mr Fico went to greet supporters in the town of Handlova. He has only recently left hospital.. His left-populist Smer party is now leading the opinion polls following the shooting, which authorities say was politically motivated.. Smer opposes sending weapons to Ukraine and instead styles itself as the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½peaceï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ party.. It has eclipsed the centre-right opposition Progressive Slovakiamecka was previously a deputy chairman of the European Parliament.. Last yearï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s election campaign was marred by insults, threats and even a punch-up between ex-prime minister Igor Matovic and Mr Ficoï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s deputy Robert Kalinak, who is now de facto acting prime minister.. Politicians on all sides are now under pressure to keep the temperature lower.. Bethany Bell in Vienna. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Stop EU Chaos, Asylum Crisis, Climate Terror, War-mongering, Corona Chaos,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ declares one poster for the far-right opposition Freedom Party (FPï¿½ï¿½), who lead the polls here.. Another image shows the head of the European Commission embracing the Ukrainian president. The governing conservative Peopleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Party (ï¿½ï¿½VP) has condemned the image as Russian propaganda.. Political analyst Thomas Hofer says in the past the Eurosceptic FPï¿½ï¿½ has had trouble mobilising its supporters for EU elections. But now 27% of Austrians say they will vote for the party, ahead of the People's Party and the opposition So%.. The Green Party is struggling, after questions arose about its lead candidate, Lena Schilling, a 23-year-old climate activist. She was accused of spreading damaging rumours and being disloyal to the Greens, which she denies.. With Austria's general election this autumn, this vote is being watched very carefully.. By Laura Gozzi. At the last European elections, Matteo Salviniï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s League came out top with over 34% of the vote. Giorgia Meloniï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Brothers of Italy (FdI) hovered around 6%.. The situation is now about to be reversed. FdI is set to win 27% of the vote ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ largely at the expense of the League, which will tumble down to just over 8%.. It is a remarkable result for Ms Meloni, who in the space of five years has gone from being a noisy but relatively minor opposition figure to prime minister and leader of Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ruling coalition ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ in which the League is a junior partner.. While Mr Salvini seems condemned to espousing increasingly radical positions in an attempt to Meloni finds herself in the enviable position of being courted by French National Rally leader Marine Le Pen and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, both of whom want her support on the European stage.. Ms Meloni has already reshaped Italy. She might now get the chance to do the same to the EU.. Damien McGuinness in Berlin. Frieden, or peace, is the word most often cropping up on campaign posters here. For radical, left-wing parties that means a halt to arming Ukraine.. But for Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is presenting himself as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½peace chancellorï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s about calming votersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ fears of escalation. . His government is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine in Europe, but he has repeatedly set red lines on some weapons, tapping into his centre-left SPD partyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s anti-war heritage.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Warmongerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is the graffiti scrawled on his face on some posters. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Dithererï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is the accusation from some critics in parliament and the media.. His party, like all three governing coalition parties, is set to get fewer votes than last time. . The conservative opposition leads the polls, and the big question is whether the far-right AfD, despite a string of recent scandals, will beat Mr Scholzï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s SPD into second place.. Nick Thorpe in Budapest. Hungarian leader Viktor Orbanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Fidesz party hoped to romp home with an easy victory, then help reshuffle Europeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s right wing.. Pushed out of the EUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s centre-right European Peoples Party, Fidesz wants a new group with Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Giorgia Meloni and Franceï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Marine Le Pen that would be ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a force for Europeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. Mr Orbanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s plans have been dented but not destroyed by the emergence of former Fidesz insider Peter Magyar and his new TISZA party.. Peter Magyar has been touring the country, drawing large crowds and striking a deep chord with tirades against Fidesz corruption, the disastrous state of schools and hospitals, constant emigration, and growing queeze the Fidesz vote now then defeat Mr Orban in the next national election in 2026. Fidesz is on 44% and falling; TISZA is on 26% and still rising. . The Hungarian PM says EU leaders and the US are warmongers over Ukraine ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and 9 June is a simple vote between peace and war.. Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid. The conservative Peopleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Party (PP) looks likely to make the most gains, as it takes votes from the struggling Ciudadanos, which could lose all eight of its seats.. For PP leader Alberto Nï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ez Feijï¿½ï¿½o, this is an opportunity to pile the pressure on Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sï¿½ï¿½nchez, whose government he is seeking to portray as corrupt ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ because of a judicial investigation into his wife, Begoï¿½ï¿½a Gï¿½ï¿½mez ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and in hock to Catalan nationalists.. Mr Sï¿½ï¿½nchez hopes recent foreign policy set-pieces, such as the announcement of a large military package for Ukraine and his governmentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s recognition of a Palestinian state, will help ensure a reason surrounding Spainï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s territorial issue and with the governmentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s controversial amnesty for Catalan nationalists hogging the headlines recently, polls suggest it is going to make gains.. A new far-right party, Se Acabï¿½ï¿½ la Fiesta (The Partyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Over) led by online agitator Alvise Pï¿½ï¿½rez, could secure a seat.. Anna Holligan in The Hague. Billboards along canals and bike lanes display a patchwork of candidates. A record 20 parties are taking part, but many here are tired of politics and turnout is likely to be low.. The Netherlands is still reeling from the twists and turns in forming a new government after November's parliamentary elections.. The issues of that vote haven't gone away: immigration, a nationwide housing shortage, climate change and the future of farming.. Geert Wildersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ far-right Freedom Party (PVV) won the 2023 election and has  dropped a longstanding pledge to hold a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Nexitï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ vote, recognising there is limited appetite for a Dutch Brexit.. The that are set to form the next Dutch government ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the liberal conservative VVD, the centrist New Social Contact and the Farmer Citizen Movement (BBB)) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  will almost half the 31 Dutch seats in the European Parliament.. In a politically polarised society, it's the Eurosceptic right and pro-EU left that are poised to make the greatest gains.. Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen. Across Denmarkï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s capital Copenhagen, posters of candidates are tied to lampposts and trees on just about every street in the city, as almost 170 them from 11 different parties, compete for 15 seats in the European Parliament.. This election may well end up being a litmus test for Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her centrist coalition government, which straddles the traditional left-right divide.. Her Social Democrats have fallen back in the polls since the 2022 general election, and her coalition partners, the Liberals and the Moderates, are also trailing.. But while Mette Frederiksen talks tough on migration polpeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s left to tighten their stance, it's the climate crisis that ranks among the most important issues for voters here..

bbc.com,'Darkest period of my life': Gay conversion therapy in Italy,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2995x14r85o,2024-06-01 23:04,"Rosario Lonegro was only 20 years old when he entered a Catholic seminary in Sicily as an aspiring priest preparing to be ordained. But while he was there he fell in love with another man and his superiors demanded that he undergo conversion therapy intended to erase his sexual preferences if he wanted to continue on the path to the priesthood.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It was the darkest period of my"" he told the BBC, recalling his seminary experience in 2017. . Haunted by guilt and fears of committing a sin in the eyes of the Catholic Church, Rosario said he ""felt trapped with no choice but to suppress my true selfï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The psychological pressure to be someone I was not was insurmountable. I could not change no matter how hard I tried.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. For more than a year, he was compelled to take part in spiritual gatherings outside the seminary, some over several days, where he was subjected to a series of distressing activities intended to strip him of his sexual proclivities. . These included being locked in a dark closet, being coerced to strip naked in front of fellow participants, and even being required to enact his own funeral. . During these rituals, he was tasked with committing to paper his perceived flaws, such as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½homosexualityï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½abominationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½falsehoodï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ - and even more explicit terms, which he was then obliged to bury beneath a symbolic gravestone.. The World Health Organization (WHO) removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1990. Subsequent scientific research has largely re not only ineffective but also harmful.. In France, Germany and predominantly Catholic Spain, conversion therapies have been officially banned, and efforts are under way both in England and Wales to outlaw such practices.. Today in Italy, it's nearly impossible to determine the precise extent of these practices, reported mostly by men, but some women too, and there is no standard legal definition of them.. In recent months, however, the BBC has conducted interviews with several young gay men across the country who have shared their experiences of being subjected to pseudoscientific group meetings or individual therapy sessions aimed at turning them into heterosexuals.. One 33-year-old man who attended this type of meeting for over two years expressed his initial motivation, saying: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I wanted to reconcile with myself. I didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want to be homosexual. I thought I needed to be cured.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I saw that as my sole path to acceptance,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said another. He was not trying to become ag acceptance in his daily life.. Gay conversion therapy is not limited to one specific region of Italy - group meetings and individual therapy sessions run across the country, some even run by licensed psychotherapists. In some cases, these gatherings and therapy sessions are unofficial and covert, often promoted through discreet conversations and secret referrals.. Other courses are publicly advertised, with known figures within Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s conservative circles actively seeking followers online and on social media platforms to promote their ability to change sexual orientations.. In Sicily, Rosario Lonegro was primarily subjected to meetings organised by the Spanish group Verdad y Libertad (Truth and Freedom), under the leadership of Miguel ï¿½ï¿½ngel Sï¿½ï¿½nchez Cordï¿½ï¿½n. This group has since disbanded, having incurred the disapproval of the Catholic Church.. However, the Italian priest who originally pushed Lonegro into these practices was given a senior position within the Church, while others conpiration from Sï¿½ï¿½nchez Cordï¿½ï¿½nï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s methods in Italy.. Many of the people the BBC spoke to were referred to Luca di Tolve, a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½moral/spiritual trainerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ who gained recognitio""I was gay once. In Medjugorie I found myself"".. On his website, Di Tolve and his wife boast that they are a ""contented couple"" seeking to ""aid anyone whose sexual identity is in turmoil, helping them to genuinely exercise their freedom in determining who they wish to be as a personï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. When contacted by the BBC, Di Tolve did not respond.. Another active individual promoting ways to tackle perceived sexual orientation is Giorgio Ponte, a well-known writer in Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ultra-conservative circles. He says he wants to help people overcome their homosexuality and be liberated, by telling his own story as a man with homosexual drives who is on his ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½potentially life-longï¿½ï""In my experience, homosexual attraction stems from an injury to one's identity that conceals needs unrelated to the sexual-erotic aspect but rather tied to a distorted perception of oneself, reflecting across all aspects of life,"" he told the BBC.. ""I believe that a homosexual person should have the freedom to try [to become heterosexual], if they want, knowing, however, that it may not be possible for everyone,"" he added.. In recent years, dozens of young men and women have sought guidance from the likes of Di Tolve, Ponte and Sï¿½ï¿½nchez Cordï¿½ï¿½n. Among them is 36-year-old Massimiliano Felicetti, a gay man who grappled with attempts to change his sexual orientation for more than 15 years. . ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I started to be uncomfortable with myself from a very early age, I felt I would never be accepted by my family, society, Church circles. I thought I was wrong, I just wanted to be loved, and these people of"" he said.. Felicetti said he had tried different solutions, consulting psychologists and clergy members who offered to help him become heterosexual. However, about two years ago, he decided to stop. A friar who knew of his struggle encouraged him to start dating a woman, but it didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t feel natural.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½When I kissed her for the first time, it felt unnatural. It was time to stop pretending,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Felicetti said.. Only a few months ago he came out as gay to his family. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It took years, but for the first time I am happy to be who I am.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Despite attempts from previous governments to promote a bill to oppose conversion therapies, no progress has been made in Italy. Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s right-wing government led by Giorgia Meloni has so far adopted a hostile stance toward LGBT rights, with the prime minister herself vowing to tackle the so-called ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½LGBT lobbyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½gender ideologyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. Such lack of progress comes as no surprise to Michele Di Bari, a researche says that Italy is structurally much slower to implement change compared with other countries in Western Europe.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This is a very elusive phenomenon, given that it is a practice prohibited by Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s order of psychologists itself. Yet, in the Italian legal system, it is not deemed illegal. People carrying out such practices canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t be punished.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Despite the complexity of the issue, experts believe that partly due to Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s strong Catholic influence, the country has been more hesitant to prohibit these controversial practices.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This may be one of the elements that, along with a strongly patriarchal and male chauvinist culture, makes the broader understanding of homosexuality and LGBT rights more difficult,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Valentina Gentile, a sociologist at Romeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s LUISS University.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½However, it is also fair to say that not all Catholicism is hostile to the inclusion of diversity and the Church itself is in a period of strong transformation in thie Catholic Church is open to everyone, including the gay community, and that it has a duty to accompany them on a personal path of spirituality, but within the framework of its rules..

bbc.com,Shops rush for Christmas stock as shipping costs surge,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqee78djzmro,2024-06-02 00:45,"European retailers are rushing to place their Christmas orders early as soaring shipping costs and trade route disruption threaten holiday deliveries, experts say.. For the last few months, vessels belonging to Western firms have been attacked in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels backing Hamas in its war with Israel, driving shipping prices up.. Container prices, which peaked in January and briefly declined, have rebounded sharply in recent weeks.. One business told the BBC that increased costs were likely to feed through to the price of big-ticket items such as white goods.. Nick Glynn, boss of the Buy It Direct group, owns several online retailers including Appliances Direct and Laptops Direct, which are having to plan and book well in advance to make sure their shipments arrive on time.. Because they are planning ahead, he said he didn't think Black Friday and Christmas stock would be affected.. But he said: ""It impacts cash and warehouse space as suddenly you have to store the goods for longer. You can't risk ordering later."". Mr Glynn explained that the spot rate - the current price for immediate delivery of goods - has dramatically increased in recent weeks from $4,500 to $7,500 (ï¿½ï¿½3,500 to ï¿½ï¿½5""This makes a massive impact on big bulky items, especially those that have low margins such as furniture, barbecues, and kitchen appliances,"" he said.. There was ""no way"" most online retailers could absorb those price increases on big-ticket items, he said.. ""So unfortunately for consumers, the next few months will see significant rises on these big-ticket items,"" he added.. Disruptions caused by Yemen's Houthi movement have limited the global supply of shipping space and containers.. The Houthi rebels have already launched attacks on more than 50 ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.. Shipping costs have soared as a result. The average cost of shipping a 40ft container now exceeds $4,000, a 140% increase from 2023, according to freight market tracker Xeneta.. Peter Sand, Xeneta's chief analyst, said that importers have learned many lessons from the pandemic including that ""the most straightforward way to protect supply chains is to ship as many of your goods as you can as quickly as possible"".. ""That is what we are seeing with some businesses telling us they are already shipping cargo for the Christmas period - in May,"" he said.. Typically, retailers start importing goods for the November Black Friday sales and Christmas shopping season between late summer and autumn.. Sue Terpilowski, from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, agreed, saying companies are realising that disruption to the Red Sea route caused by Houthi attacks could last until the autumn.. ""To avoid headlines 'Christmas is cancelled, there's nothing in the shops', people are now actually bringing forward their shipments,"" she said. ""So they'll be here in good time allowing any eventualities that might happen while they are at sea."". The attacks on ships have forced owners of vessels travelling between Asia and Europe to take a longer route around Africa, and so ships are starting their journeys earlier to allow for the extra time needed for the diversion.. ""The effects of the diversions from the Red Sea that started last December are only now becoming apparent, with vessels on the Asia-Europe trade needing more than 100 days on a rotation by circumventing Africa,"" said Dominique Nadelhofer, from Kuehne + Nagel, a major sea logistics firm.. He added that the rotation of container equipment has also been disrupted, and said only around 50% of global container shipping is currently completed on time.. As well as concerns about potential future Houthi attacks, there are also growing fears that as naval forces focus on countering the Houthi rebels, the resulting reduction in maritime patrols elsewhere may provide Somali pirates with opportunities to increase their activities.. Cheltenham's Cavendish House, which closed in April, is providing a temporary home to local traders.. Abercrombie & Fitch is enjoying its strongest growth streak in more than a decade.. Household budgets have come under pressure as prices soared in the wake of the pandemic.. The Merrion Centre is Leeds' longest-standing shopping centre..

bbc.com,Will using Western weapons on Russia help Ukraine change the war?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjll1r1el5wo,2024-06-01 21:04,"Ukraine is now allowed to use Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia. What will this decision change and how will it affect the front line in Ukraine?. Up until now, Western countries restricted the use of their weapons to military targets located inside Ukraine, including Crimea and occupied territories. They were concerned that attacking targets across the internationally recognised border with weapons provided by Nato countries would escalate the conflict.. But the latest Russian advance in the north-eastern Kharkiv region convinced Kyivï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s allies that in order to defend itself, Ukraine must be able to destroy military targets on the other side of the border as well.. Last month, Russia launched a massive ground assault in the region, opening a new front and capturing several villages. The Russian advance posed a serious threat to Kharkiv, Ukraineï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s second-largest city, which is just 30km away from the border.. The border in this region is effectively the front line as well, so the banstern weapons to hit targets beyond Ukraine enabled Russian troops to prepare for that operation in a safe environment.. Following the growing pressure from Ukraine and other European states, the US agreed to change its policy and allow Kyiv to strike Russia with Western weapons.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The hallmark of our engagement has been to adapt and adjust as necessary, to meet whatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s actually going on on the battlefield, to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, when it needs it,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Prague on Friday.. Just a few days before this announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to expand ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sanitary zonesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ in case Western long-range weapons are used to strike the Russian territory. . He said that Nato countries in Europe must remember that they have ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½states with small territories and dense populationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. . ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½They must take this factor into consideration prior to discussi he added.. Avoiding an escalation is probably the reason why the US didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t include long-range weapons such as ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) in its permission to strike Russia. These missiles have a range of 300km and could be used to hit military bases and airfields well into Russian territory.. Such limitations leave Ukraine with only the option of focusing on targets near its border.  But this is still a major policy shift by Kyivï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s main allies.. Even with a shorter range - up to 70km - multiple rocket launchers such as HIMARS can significantly disrupt Russian logistics operations and troops movement, which will ultimately slow down any offensive plans.. Now, Ukraine can ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½strike places where the enemy concentrated its troops, equipment and supply storage facilities that are used to attack Ukraine,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ says Yuriy Povkh from the Kharkiv tactical group that co-ordinates military operations in the north-east.. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stateing its troops just 90km from Kharkiv for another offensive.  . And the Institute for Study of War analysed satellite images and confirmed that there were ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½expanded activities at depots and warehousesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ in that area.  So the ability to target those facilities will seriously strengthen the capacity of Ukrainian forces to repel new attacks in the region.. Lifting the ban on Western weapons, however, is unlikely to help to protect Ukraine from Russian glide bombs known locally as KAB. They have a devastating effect and are regularly used to bomb Kharkiv and other border towns.  But to stop such attacks, Ukrainian forces must target planes that drop those deadly KABs.. The only weapon capable of intercepting those planes that Ukraine has at its disposal at this moment is the US air-defence system Patriot.  However, getting this weapon close to Kharkiv is a huge risk.  Spy drones can quickly spot it and Moscow can launch missiles such as Iskander to destroy this expensive system.. Interestingly, thece, which provide Ukraine with jointly made Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles (or Scalp as they are called in France), havenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t explicitly restricted their use.  And their range can go up to 250km. In fact, French President Emanuel Macron told journalists last week:ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We should allow [Ukraine] to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. And such rhetoric is seen as permission to use Storm Shadows/Scalps, a military aviation officer who prefers to remain anonymous, told the BBC.  So, he says, Ukraine can now hit airfields in the Kursk and Belgorod regions that border Ukraine.. However, such operations will be limited in terms of what they can achieve. Ukrainian Su-24s that are equipped with these cruise missiles will have to get close to the Russian border in order to launch them, which makes them vulnerable to Russian air defence systems. F-16 jets that are expected by the end of this year d for such tasks.  But President Zelensky admits that itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s still not clear whether Ukraineï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s partners will allow these jets to be used to attack targets in Russia.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I think that using any weapon, Western kind of weapon, on the territory of Russia is a question of time,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said at the Nordic summit in Stockholm on Friday.. Ukrainian forces are trying to develop their own weapons to hit targets in Russiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s rear.  Some of their drones have attacked oil depots and military facilities hundreds of kilometres away from the border.  . The latest attack was on a long-range radar station in the city of Orsk, which is 1800km from the Ukrainian border.. Both countries are trying to dissuade others from attending the upcoming event, Ukraine's president says.. Estonia is pouring money and weapons into Ukraineï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s war effort to try to push back the Russians.""provoking a new level of tension"" over the use of Western-supplied weapons.. The US president gives Ukraine permission to use US-supplied weapons to strike targets in Russia, but only near Kharkiv. . Several Western allies have signalled they are open to Ukraine using their weapons against Russia.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

He starred as Alan Bates in the ITV show Mr Bates vs the Post Office, which tells the story of hundreds of sub-postmasters who were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting.. Many of the reported losses in branch accounts which led to prosecutions were actually caused by faults in Horizon - the Post Office's computer system.. Jones, speaking at the Hay Festival, said Bates - a former sub-postmaster himself, who led the victims' campaign to get justice - ""doesn't want any honours until he's finished the job"".. ""I get to play a hero. Really, someone who I think of as a hero. Someone in the culture who just doesn't seem to be subject to the same forces that we all are,"" the 57-year-old said.. ""He can't be bought. He's asked to open Glastonbury. 'No, thank you'. He's asked to do these things, he doesn't want to do any of that. He says, 'I've got work to do', which is to get that stuff done."". Jones added that the values that Bates had demonstrated, such as duty and following things through are ""unfashionable"" now, but he remembered ""being lectured about"" them when he was growing up.. The Post Office Horizon scandal has been called the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history.. The four-part series, which aired at the start of the year, renewed mass public interest in the plight of the victims like never before.. Last month, a bill quashing the convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters became law just before Parliament ended ahead of the general election.. Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells also recently faced three days of questions at the public inquiry into the scandal.. When reflecting on what exactly had made the show such a hit, Jones said there was ""a feeling of disempowerment"" in the country.. ""There's a feeling of outrage, justly, and the story is told very clearly, and it's by no means obvious,"" he said.. ""Computer software malfunction is not an obvious thing to make a drama about."". He also spoke about the victims of the scandal, describing them as having ""this extraordinary dignity, considering 20 years of living in a Hitchcockian nightmare.. ""They have this incredible humble modest humility."". The 93-year-old tied the knot with his new wife Elena Zhukova in a ceremony at his Californian vineyard..

bbc.com,Zelensky accuses Russia and China of undermining summit,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722q4dn7e1o,2024-06-02 10:42,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia and China of attempting to undermine his upcoming global peace summit in Switzerland.. He said Russia was trying to dissuade other states from attending the event, and that China was working to do this as well.. Speaking at an Asian security forum, he also said there were ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½elements of Russiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s weaponryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ that come from China.. China says it does not side with either side of the Ukraine war, a position that has been increasingly questioned particularly by the US. . Beijing is accused of aiding Moscow by sending components for weapons. It is also seen as propping up the Russian economy by purchasing vast quantities of oil and gas, softening the impact of Western sanctions.. Mr Zelensky made a surprise appearance at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore attended by defence chiefs from around the world, including US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chinese defence minister Dong Jun.. The visit was aimed at drumming up support fro Besides meeting regional leaders, he also urged delegates to attend his summit due to be held later in June. . Mr Zelensky said it would focus on achieving nuclear security, food security, and the release of prisoners of war and Ukrainian children held in Russia.. So far 106 countries said they would send high-level representatives or their leaders to the summit, he said. . Russia has not been invited and China is not attending. . A formal invitation was not issued to Russia as Moscow had told Switzerland early on that it did not want to participate, the BBC understands.. Mr Zelensky claimed that Russia was attempting to disrupt the summit by pressuring countries not to attend, through threats of a blockade of agricultural goods, chemical goods, and energy.. Certain countries were assisting this ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½diplomatic disruptionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, he added.. He named China later on, and said it was ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½working for countries to not come to the peace summitï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, unlike the US which has promised to send a high-les encouraging others to attend.. Russia was doing ""everything to disrupt the peace summit"" by using ""Chinese influence on the region"" and diplomats to do so, he said.. ""It is unfortunate that such a big, independent, powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin."". China's foreign ministry had said that the conference ""should have the recognition of Russia and Ukraine"" and equal participation. ""Otherwise, it is difficult for the conference to play a substantive role in restoring peace,"" a spokeswoman said on Friday.. Mr Zelensky also said China's leader Xi Jinping had earlier promised him they would ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½stand aside in this war and would not support Russia with weaponsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. But, he added, there are now ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½elements that are part of Russiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s weaponryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ that come from China, according to various intelligence agencies. He called for China to maintain a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½consistentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ position.. The US has said that China is helping Russia make more munitions, armoured vehicles and missiles. It estimates about 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the microelectronics Russia imports come from China.. Earlier on Sunday, Chinese defence minister Dong Jun said they do not supply weapons to either party of the Ukra""strict controls"" on the exports of dual-use technology, which are items that can be used for civilian and military purposes.. ""We have never done anything to fan the flames. We stand firmly on the side of peace and dialogue,"" he said in his speech.. Mr Zelensky said he did not meet Mr Dong at the dialogue, but he did meet Mr Austin. The two discussed the USï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ decision to let Ukraine use American weapons on Russian territory, according to Mr Zelensky. . That decision comes with certain restrictions. Asked by the BBC if he requested the removal of limitations, he said he was grateful to the US for allowing Ukraine to use the HIMARS artillery rocket system by the border of the Kharkiv region which has seen intense fighting.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Is that sufficient? No,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said, adding that there were airfields from which Russia was permanently firing ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½knowing that Ukraine will not fire backï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. The US joins other Western states such as France in allowing Ukraine more leeway in using Western-supplied weapons. Russia has warned of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½serious consequencesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ of this move.. This weekend marked the second time Mr Zelensky has visited Asia since the war began. He made a surprise appearance at the G7 leaderse Supplies of electricity have been cut off in several areas and schools ordered to remain shut.. Wales will be without Laura Oï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Sullivan and Josie Green for Tuesday's 2025 Women's European Championship qualifier away to Ukraine..

bbc.com,Michael Ball thanks Steve Wright as he takes over late DJ's Sunday show,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cekkx5me3jko,2024-06-02 13:09,"Michael Ball has paid tribute to Steve Wright, calling his legacy ""immeasurable"", as he took over the the late DJ's Sunday Love Songs programme on BBC Radio 2.. Ball, a West End star who has presented on Radio 2 since 2008, was named as the show's new host after Wright died in February.. The 61-year-old said Wright was ""missed"", adding: ""He created Love Songs, and I am so, so proud to be carrying the baton for him into the future."". Wright joined the BBC in the 1970s, and went on to host shows on Radio 1 and Radio 2 for more than four decades. He also presented Top of the Pops on BBC One.. The death of the beloved presenter at the age of 69 led to an outpouring of tributes across the BBC and beyond.. Ball was among those paying tribute at the time, calling the news ""unbelievably sad and shocking"", and calling Wright ""an inspiration, a cheerleader and a lovely man"".. During the show - which is now called Love Songs with Michael Ball - the presenter revealed that the last song he played would be a tribute to Wright.. The final song on the weekly show is known as the ""last dance"". Ball said that this Sunday, it would be something ""very special"", and one of Wright's favourites.. ""So in memory of Steve, I want you to give someone a hug. Make that time for it now.. ""Your partner, your friend, (your) child, parent, even your pet.. ""And if you're on your own right now, I'm embracing you with a virtual hug.. ""And I want to take this opportunity to thank Steve, his legacy on Radio 2 is immeasurable."". He went on to play the song Wichita Lineman by Glen Campbell, a song Wright regularly used as background music for his show.. Ball said he hoped audiences would ""take a moment and maybe have a little dance along with me"".. Sunday Love Songs was a show that was dear to Wright's heart.. After his 15-year stint on Radio 1 ended, he worked in commercial radio for a short while but then joined Radio 2 as part of the weekend line-up and launched Sunday Love Songs in 1996.. He developed the format himself as a programme where he could read out listener emails and letters exactly as they were written.. When he was subsequently given the Radio 2 afternoon show - which he hosted for 23 years - he agreed a special deal that allowed him to also present Sunday Love Songs each week. And even when he was replaced by Scott Mills on the afternoon show in 2022, he again continued his Sunday stint until the day before his death.. Ball now hosts the show on Sundays from 09:00 to 11:00.. Ten finalists, including a choir and a magician, will compete in Sunday night's live final.. A seven-party debate is to be held on Friday, before a Question Time special and head-to-head event..

He added: ""Having developed a love for the countryside I'm also on a personal mission to learn more about rural skills which is so central to the foundation's work.. ""It was inspiring to hear from the King about the work of His Majesty's foundation during my recent visit to Highgrove Gardens - and compare beekeeping tips!"".

The helicopter carrying leading security personnel crashed on the Mull of Kintyre peninsula on the west coast of Scotland on 2 June 1994.. The aircraft was on its way from RAF Aldergrove near Belfast to a security conference in Inverness when it crashed into a hillside in thick fog.. The incident was the worst RAF peacetime disaster and the reasons for the crash remain unclear.. Rev Roddy McNidder, who was the parish minister at the time of the crash, delivered the sermon at Southend Parish Church and described the 25 passengers and four crew who died as ""extraordinary people who were selflessly devoted to duty in the service of their country"".. During the service, he said: ""Our service this early afternoon continues our promise that we care.. ""This church is here for you and your families and loved ones, to remember, to honour their memory and their service.. ""To bring the gift of encouragement, sensitively and graciously, and to hold fast the standards and principles they represented."". The crash came just two months before the 1994 IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland.. Passengers on RAF Chinook ZD576 included leading security personnel from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), MI5 and the Army.. The pilots, flight lieutenants Jonathan Tapper and Richard Cook, were initially accused of gross negligence over the crash.. A Scottish fatal accident inquiry (FAI) concluded it was impossible to establish the exact cause of the crash and in 2011 the pilots were exonerated.. Families of those killed previously said they had been ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½failedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ by the Ministry of Defence who did not organise a 30th anniversary memorial..

bbc.com,Mystery as doctor finds live goldfish in garden,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl448x6ly4jo,2024-06-02 14:21,"A junior doctor has ended up with a new pet after a goldfish mysteriously appeared in his garden. . Dr Ben Beska, 33, from Newcastle, said he saw a group of magpies squawking in his garden on Saturday and went out to investigate when he spotted the fish lying in the grass.. The NHS cardiology doctor retrieved the fish and placed it in a freezer drawer filled with water, and intends to keep it as a pet. . ""It's pretty mad really, finding a fish on the lawn. I have no idea how it got in the garden,"" Dr Beska said.. The fish has now been named Alice after a text message he sent to a friend regarding the animal autocorrected from ""it's alive"" to ""it's alice"".. Dr Beska said that once he spotted the fish moving on the grass he ""couldn't just leave it"".. He said he picked up the ""flapping"" fish and found an old freezer drawer which he filled with water.. ""It started to swim around so it was alive,"" he said.. ""I locked my cats out of the kitchen, obviously, I didn't want them to eat it, that would have been a terrible end to the story,"" Dr Beska added.. He went to a nearby shop and purchased a tank and some chemicals, adding: ""I think it was seconds from death so it's a lucky fish."". Dr Beska suspected a bird had picked up the fish from a nearby pond and dropped it while carrying it away.. However, he said, there were no ponds close by and he thought it must therefore have travelled a ""reasonable distance"".. The mystery of the goldfish has gone viral on X, formerly Twitter, with Dr Beska's initial post about it gaining more than 16 million views which he said was ""bonkers"".. He said: ""It's very odd, I mainly use [X] for medical stuff, so this is very, very different.. ""It's been quite funny, some of the comments are quite funny and about 1,000 people said they thought a bird dropped it."". One X user has even created a separate account for the fish, with the username alicebeska.. One post on the account for the fish reads: ""Such a wild day, booked one of those journeetrips and wound up in some northerner's lawn? I would like a refund please."". Dr Beska now intends to keep the fish as a pet, with plans to purchase a larger tank and possibly another fish to keep it company. .

bbc.com,Burrow was sporting great and inspiring MND campaigner,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/articles/crggwy1wp96o,2024-06-02 19:16,"This video can not be played. Rob Burrow was a Super League star before becoming an MND campaigner. A champion on and off the field, the determination, courage and humility of Rob Burrow guaranteed a legacy that stretches way beyond the sport he loved.. At 5ft 5in, Burrow was among the smallest men in rugby league, but he became one of its biggest names.. Father, family man, friend, competitor, campaigner. His death aged 41 comes nearly five years after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.. When Burrow learned of his illness, he told his wife Lindsey: ""Thank God it's me and not the kids."". His stoic resilience helped to transform the profile of this condition. His moving story was brought to millions by the BBC Breakfast team who became friends.. Decorated for his talents, Burrow played 492 times for Leeds Rhinos, won eight Grand Finals, three World Club Challenges and two Challenge Cups, as well as 15 England and five Great Britain caps.. Rugby league legend Burrow dies aged 41. Tributes paid to Rob Burrow following death at 41. A mural was painted on the side of Leeds Beckett University's Student Union to honour Rob Burrow. With his slight frame and diminutive stature, Burrow always stood out among the hulks of the modern rugby league game, from his junior days right through to the elite.. What he lacked in size, he made up for in devastating speed, evasiveness and skill, and he honed his tackling technique to enable him to compensate when it came to felling far bigger opponents.. One moment which best summed up his qualities was his try in Leeds' 2011 Grand Final win against St Helens, when having stepped off the bench at hooker, he ducked through the line and in full flight stepped his way past international full-back Paul Wellens to score a remarkable solo effort.. There was also the emotion of his final game in 2017, when he and long-time friend Danny McGuire - two members of Leeds' oft-referred 'golden generation' - bowed out together with Grand Final success at Old Trafford against Burrow's hometown club Castleford.. Rob Burrow (right) lifts the Super League trophy with Danny McGuire following Leeds' Grand Final win over Castleford in 2017 - their final game for the club. On Burrow's retirement that year, Leeds head coach Brian McDermott said: ""Rob will be remembered as one of the greats of our game, not just in the Super League era but throughout the history of the sport."". He initially continued to work in rugby league after hanging up the boots, helping to develop the next generation at Headingley with the club he loved.. It was his resolve and positive outlook after his career ended that brought this unique character to a wider audience.. Burrow revealed he had been diagnosed with MND in December of 2019. There is no cure.. He would gradually lose his ability to talk, to move, and to breathe easily.. ""It's heartbreaking,"" consultant neurologist Dr Agam Jung told a BBC documentary on Burrow.. ""You may not be able to speak, you may not be able to swallow, you may not be able to breathe independently, you have weakness in your arms and legs. This leads to dependency and a reduced life span."". This video can not be played. How Rob Burrow's life changed after his diagnosis - from Rob Burrow: Living with MND. Burrow married his childhood sweetheart Lindsey in 2006 and the couple had three children together.. ""He always says, 'find somebody else, you're still young',"" Lindsey said in the documentary, discussing the prospect of a future without her husband. ""There will never be anyone else. No-one can ever take Rob's place."". His parents, Geoff and Irene, would help to feed Burrow.. Alongside looking after children Macy, Maya and Jackson and working as a physio in the NHS, Lindsey was effectively his primary carer - her love shining through during the difficult days since his diagnosis.. ""Yes, it is sad, but it is a story full of love, hope and optimism,"" she said.. Burrow lost weight and could not kick a ball with his son or change a nappy, but he retained his spirit despite losing his independence.. A little smile. A defiant thumbs-up. ""My mind is so strong and positive,"" he would say via a speech recognition tool which used recorded samples of his voice.. He joined others including former rugby union player Doddie Weir and footballer Stephen Darby in raising awareness and was brutally honest about the effects of the condition.. ""I'm a prisoner in my own body,"" Burrow said. ""The lights are on, but no-one's home. I think like you, but my mind doesn't work right. I can't move my body."". This video can not be played. Rob Burrow's mother Irene with her son - from Rob Burrow: Living with MND. Burrow, together with family and friends, wanted to raise funds and awareness around a disease which affects around 5,000 people in the UK.. ""It's like a game in a way. We are here to try to beat MND and the only way we are going to win is by collective effort,"" said Weir, who died in November 2022.. Despite his illness, Burrow remained relentlessly positive.. ""Whenever you're around Rob, there's love, there's laughter, there's jokes, usually at my expense or some other big bloke,"" said former team-mate Barrie McDermott.. ""What he lacked in size, he more than made up for in his wit and sharpness."". Lindsey would help him into a swimming pool. It was the only way he could walk without suffering debilitating pain in his joints.. Burrow would joke: ""I know when you get married you say, 'in sickness and in health'. I did not think she signed up to look after me so soon."". Kevin Sinfield (right) has raised millions of pounds for motor neurone disease since his former Leeds team-mate's diagnosis. An appeal was launched to raise ï¿½ï¿½5m to build a Rob Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease in Leeds.. One of the prominent fundraisers was Kevin Sinfield, Leeds captain for the bulk of Burrow's playing career. They met when Burrow was 12 and a heartwarming friendship was formed.. When Sinfield ran seven marathons in seven days in December 2020, there was a poignant moment when he spied Burrow and family. The deep bond was clea""To see what he's had to go through has been really difficult. Rob was a champion on the field and an incredible friend,"" said Sinfield.. As a child, Burrow was told he was too small to make it as a player. It turned out his impact was bigger than anyone could have imagined.. ""I have a disease with no cure but I have too many reasons to live,"" he said of his life-limiting illness. ""I am not giving in until my last breath."". In December 2019, he was told he may have a year to live, two at most. He defied all the expectations.. This video can not be played. Burrow scores sensational try against St Helens.

There had been a three-way tie heading into what became a dramatic final day, with Australia's Minjee Lee, American Andrea Lee and Thailand's Wichanee Meechai level at the top of the leaderboard.. But Saso, 22, produced a run of four birdies from five holes on the back nine to snatch victory by three strokes, completing a two-under-par round of 68 to finish on four under at Lancaster Country Club in Pennsylvania, with compatriot Hinako Shibuno finishing second.. That gave Saso, who switched her international allegiance from the Philippines in 2022, her second LPGA Tour title - both coming at the US Women's Open.. Saso became the first Filipino player to win a major when she clinched her first US Women's Open title as a teenager in 2021..

Saso suffered an early blow on Sunday when she followed a birdie on the second by four-putting the sixth for a double bogey..

bbc.com,Muir & Reekie claim wins at Stockholm Diamond League,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cnllq42g5n2o,2024-06-02 19:20,"This video can not be played. Britain's Laura Muir wins women's 1500m at Stockholm Diamond League. Britons Laura Muir and Jemma Reekie both claimed victories at the Stockholm Diamond League, as Swedish pole vault star Armand Duplantis went close to setting another world record on home soil.. Olympic silver medallist Muir, 31, showed an impressive turn of speed as she burst clear in the final 200m to win the women's 1500m in three minutes 57.99 seconds.. ""To be running what I am now and knowing that I have a couple more months of training before the Olympics is very exciting going forward,"" said Muir, who began her outdoor season by running 3:56.35 for fourth place in Eugene last week.. ""It is all about August this year. That is when I need to be at my best."". While not an official Diamond League race - meaning no points were on offer as athletes look to qualify for September's final - Muir's fellow Scot Reekie, 26, controlled the women's 800m to win in 1:57.79.. Olympic and world champion Duplantis sought to break the men's pole vault world record for the ninth time as he was cheered on by his home crowd. . After claiming victory as the only athlete over 6.00m, the 24-year-old went agonisingly close but failed to go clear in three attempts at 6.25m.. British world bronze medallist Ben Pattison finished fourth in the men's 800m in a season's best 1:44.44. Elliot Giles was sixth in 1:45.10, while former 1500m world champion Jake Wightman clocked 1:45.35 for eighth as he continued his return to fitness following an injury-disrupted 2023.. Revee-Walcott-Nolan was sixth in the women's 1500m in a personal best 4:00.77.. Jamaica's world champion Shericka Jackson ran a season's best 22.69secs to win the women's 200m as Britain's Amy Hunt finished third in 22.92secs.. Elsewhere, Dutch world 400m hurdles champion Femke Bol posted her fastest ever season opener in 53.07 seconds.. The seventh stop of the Diamond League series in Stockholm marked the halfway stage in the road to the final in Brussels on 13-14 September.. Only three Diamond League meetings remain before the athletics programme begins at Paris 2024 in August, with Paris, Monaco and London each hosting crucial opportunities for athletes to finalise their preparations before the Olympic Games.. Lausanne, Silesia, Rome and Zurich offer the last stages for athletes to earn points as they seek to qualify for the final, where trophies and prize money will be up for grabs.. The series began in April with a double-header in China, where Duplantis opened his season in spectacular fashion by breaking the pole vault world record in Xiamen, before Briton Daryll Neita made an exciting start to her season by beating world 100m champion Sha'Carri Richardson to win over 200m in Suzhou.. British rising star Molly Caudery underlined her Olympic gold medal potential by beating reigning pole vault world champion Nina Kennedy in Doha, where Neita continued her winning start by triumphing over 100m.. The highly anticipated Prefontaine Classic in Eugene brought significant victories for British pair Josh Kerr and Keely Hodgkinson, with Kerr setting a British mile record in defeating rival Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Hodgkinson taking a commanding 800m victory over world champion Mary Moraa.. In Oslo, Matt Hudson-Smith produced a statement performance in his season opener as the world 400m silver medallist set a European record, while Ingebrigtsen responded to his Eugene loss in dramatic fashion by diving across the line to claim victory on home soil..

bbc.com,What is happening to gas and electricity bills?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58090533,2024-05-24 09:51,"Gas and electricity bills will fall by an average 7% in England, Scotland and Wales on 1 July.. The new energy price cap means the typical annual bill paid by direct debit will fall to ï¿½ï¿½1,568 per year.. However, while bills will be at their lowest for two years, they remain about ï¿½ï¿½400 higher than three years ago.. The energy price cap covers 28 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months, external by the energy regulator Ofgem.. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit.. From 1 July until 30 September, gas prices will be capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh. . The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Prices are also falling there.. Ofgem said that from 1 July, a household using a typical amount of energy and paying by direct debit, external for dual gas and electrici pay ï¿½ï¿½1,568 per year.. That is a fall of ï¿½ï¿½122 compared to the annual bill on charges between April and June.. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay more, with a typical bill of ï¿½ï¿½1,668 a year.. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. . The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, and how many people live there, are also relevant.. The Ofgem cap is""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single contract for gas and electricity, which they pay by direct debit.. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way, to help spread payments across the year.. Those who pay every three months by cash and cheque are charged more. . In March, Ofgem said it was considering a range of options for changing the current energy cap system. . From 1 July households on pre-payment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of ï¿½ï¿½1,522.. Since April they have paid the same as those on direct debit, but were previously charged more.. About four million households had prepayment meters in July 2023, according to Ofgem. . Many have been in place for years, but some meters were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay their bills. . New rules mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter, and they cannot be installed at all in certain eholds.. Although the overall cap has fallen, standing charges - a fixed daily amount which covers the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged.. Standing charges are 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region.. Ofgem said tens of thousands of customers responded to its recent consultation about how standing charges work.. The regulator is also adding ï¿½ï¿½28 to everyone's bill over the year to cover the cost of dealing with ï¿½ï¿½3.1bn of debt that customers owe to suppliers.. The fall in energy prices raised hopes that suppliers would offer cheaper, fixed-price deals.. These offer certainty for a set period, but if prices drop further, people could find themselves stuck at the higher price.. Analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have forecast a rise in the typical bill to ï¿½ï¿½1,762 in October, staying at that level in January. However, forecasts are not always correct and may change owing to events.. When considering switching to a fixed-price deal, Ofgem should seek independent advice and ""consider what is most important for them, whether that's the lowest price or the security of a fixed deal"".. Price comparison website Uswitch says it expects ""increased competition"" from suppliers, but warns that people to check any exit fees if they want to leave a fixed deal early.. Certain groups - such as pensioners and those on some means-tested or disability benefits - received extra cost-of-living payments when bills soared. . But much of that extra support has now finished. . The ï¿½ï¿½500m Household Support Fund, external, which the government introduced to help vulnerable households with costs in September 2021, had been due to end in March 2024. . However, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced a six-month extension in the spring Budget. .

However, previous changes to the way tax is calculated mean the amount people pay overall is rising. . The starting rate for NI changed from 10% to 8% for 27 million workers on 6 April 2024.. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who announced the measure in the Budget, said this was worth about ï¿½ï¿½450 a year to an employee on an average salary of ï¿½ï¿½35,000.. Two million self-employed workers also got a cut in the main rate of NI.. Contributions on all earnings between ï¿½ï¿½12,570 and ï¿½ï¿½50,270 have been cut from a rate of 9% to 6%. The government has said that is worth ï¿½ï¿½350 to a self-employed person earning ï¿½ï¿½28,200. . Your device may not support this calculator. NI was also cut at the start of the year. Since 6 January, millions of employees have been paying 10% on their earnings between ï¿½ï¿½12,571 and ï¿½ï¿½50,270, external. They previously paid 12%. . The government has said that when combined with the latest cut, a worker on ï¿½ï¿½35,000 we self-employed, Class 4 NI contributions on all earnings between ï¿½ï¿½12,570 and ï¿½ï¿½50,270 were already due to be cut from a rate of 9% to 8% in April. They will no longer pay a separate category of NI called Class 2 contributions. . The NI rate on income and profits above ï¿½ï¿½50,270 remains at 2%. . The government uses National Insurance contributions (NICs) to pay for benefits and help fund the NHS. . NI rates apply across the UK. You start paying NI when you turn 16 and earn over ï¿½ï¿½242 a week, or have profits of more than ï¿½ï¿½12,570 a year. . It is not paid by people over the state pension age, even if they are working. . Eligibility for some benefits, including the state pension, depends on the NI contributions you make across your working life, external.. The government records how many years of contributions you have made. Paying a lower rate of NI does not mean you contribute fewer years. . If you do not work, for example because you are a carer or claim benefits, you might be able to recead, which mean you will still qualify for the relevant benefits. . You can also make voluntary contributions to plug gaps in your record.. How does National Insurance work?, external. Check your National Insurance record, external. Despite the NI cuts in January and April, millions will still pay more tax overall because of changes to the tax thresholds. . These are the income levels at which people start paying NI or income tax, or have to pay higher rates. . These used to rise every year in line with inflation. . However, the NI threshold and tax-free personal allowance - the amount you can earn every year before you have to pay income tax, external - have been frozen at ï¿½ï¿½12,570 until 2028. Higher-rate tax will continue to kick in for earnings above ï¿½ï¿½50,270. . Freezing the thresholds means that more people start paying tax and NI as their wages increase, and more people pay higher rates. . It will create 3.2 million extra taxpayers by 2028, and 2.6 million more people will pay higher rates, accordhe Office for Budget Responsibility, external (OBR), which conducts independent assessments of the government's economic plans. . According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think thank, the freeze cancels out the benefits of the NI cuts for some workers. . In the upcoming financial year, an average earner will have a tax cut of about ï¿½ï¿½340 - from the combined tax changes - and people earning between ï¿½ï¿½26,000 and ï¿½ï¿½60,000 will be better off. . But by 2027, the average earner would be only ï¿½ï¿½140 better off - and only people earning between ï¿½ï¿½32,000 and ï¿½ï¿½55,000 a year would be better off..

You lose ï¿½ï¿½1 of your personal allowance for every ï¿½ï¿½2 that your income goes above ï¿½ï¿½100,000. . Anyone earning more than ï¿½ï¿½125,140 a year no longer has any tax-free personal allowance. . The additional rate of income tax is 45%, and is paid on all earnings above ï¿½ï¿½125,140 a year. . These apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.. Some income tax rates are different, external in Scotland. . In Scotland a new 45% band has taken effect. The top rate has also risen from 47% to 48%.. For most families, income tax is the single biggest tax they pay. . But for less well-off households, a greater share of family income goes on taxes on spending, known as indirect taxes. . For the poorest fifth of households, VAT is the biggest single tax paid.. You can look at the amount of tax raised as a proportion of t. In 2022 - the most recent year for which international comparisons can be made - that figure was 35.3%..

bbc.com,Five hacks to help save money on your food shop,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61798003,2023-11-29 15:53,"As price rises bite into budgets, many people are cutting back on the weekly food shop.. Makers of some popular food brands have raised prices by more than their costs over the past two years, according to the UK's competition watchdog.. As well as buying less, people are looking for ways to make their money go further and to make the most of what they have. The BBC spoke to money bloggers for their tried and tested tips.. Rosie suggests taking a good look at your cupboards before each shopping trip. ""We all know the value of making a list, but if you're adding to what you've already got in your cupboards, then you're going to spend money on things you don't need,"" she says. . ""There's no point in buying more jars of pasta sauce if you've already got five of them in the cupboard."" . Rosie Forshaw has cut her food shop down to ï¿½ï¿½40 a week. She keeps a list of what's in her cupboards in a notebook, so she always knows what she already has when she goes shopping. She says it has helped bring her weekly food shop for her, her husband and one-year-old son down to around ï¿½ï¿½40.. Lynn recommends changing how you shop when you walk into a store and to head straight for the reduced s""If you spot something there that's on your list, you can tick that off and you've already saved some money,"" she says.. She suggests then going straight to the frozen-foods section, and then the canned-produce aisle.. ""Frozen meat, fish and vegetables will almost always be cheaper than the fresh option,"" she says. ""If you get what you need from there before going on to the fresh produce aisles, you're likely to make significant savings."". According to sustainability charity Wrap, the average household wastes around ï¿½ï¿½700 every year , externalby throwing food away. Lynn says making better use of her freezer has helped her cut down dramatically on wast""If things are getting close to their use-by date you should always try to freeze them,"" she says. ""Things like milk and cheese, even fruit and vegetables, can all be frozen and kept for when you need them."". Kate Hall says freezing food can make it last. More on the basics of freezing can be found on the Food Standards Agency website, external.. Kate Hall, who runs The Full Freezer website, uses her freezer as a pause button rather than a long-term storage solution. She says that while almost all foods can be frozen, you do have to change the way you use them.. ""You can't defrost a banana or salad and expect it to be the same as when it went into the freezer,"" she explains. ""But if you think about how you could use it in puddings or in soups or in casseroles, then you're going to save a lot of money."". Rosie says that a lot of what we buy in the supermarket is packaged for their convenience and not ours.

She puts hers in a paper bag when she gets them home but says just taking off the plastic wrapping will help them last longer.. Helen White, from Wrap, which runs the Love Food Hate Waste campaign, says there are small things we can do to make food last longer, especially fresh vegetables and salads - the UK's most wasted food group. .

We asked you for your tips, here are some you sent in: . My wife and I sit with our iPads on both Asda and Tesco and put in the exact same things for our weekly delivery. We then check at the end total costs including delivery and whoever is cheapest 'wins' our order. We feel that writing a list of things you need then getting them online saves going to the shop where we would invariably end up throwing things in that we don't need. Russell, Portstewart, Northern Ireland. I highly recommend having a weekly menu, so you know what you are going to cook/prepare for your meals each week. I post this on our fridge and our family of five always knows what to expect. This not only saves money but eliminates the stress of ""what's for dinner""? I know exactly what I need to get, and I stick to my budget because I go to the supermarket with a plan, plus I check the fridge/pantry before I go shopping. Michelle Lutchman, Surrey. Tip is not about food but about cleaning products. There is much money to be saved on laundry and cleaning products. These are full of gimmicks to make us buy additional stuff. For instance, you don't need separate washing powder for coloureds. Fading is largely due to exposure to daylight rather than brighteners in washing powder. Helen Borodzicz, Lytham, St Annes.  I go to the supermarket at about 2.30 pm when they are reducing sandwiches - that's my tea sorted! Sue Tingey, Wiltshire. How is the rising cost of living changing the food you eat?

LIVE: UK inflation falls to 2.3% as energy prices cool. Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time..

For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. . Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. . In May, the Bank of England held rates at 5.25% for a sixth time..

bbc.com,How are universal credit rules changing?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41487126,2024-05-13 13:44,"Many people receiving universal credit (UC) will now have to work longer hours, as part of government plans to encourage people into employment.. However, the Turn2Us charity warned of a ""drastic impact"" on people with long-term health conditions, caring responsibilities or irregular incomes.. Universal credit is a single benefit payment for working-age people, external. . It was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people. . There were 6.4 million people on UC in January in England, Scotland and Wales, according to official government statistics., external Nearly 40% of claimants have jobs.. The government is expected to spend ï¿½ï¿½90bn on UC in 2024-25.. That compares with ï¿½ï¿½153bn on state pensions and other benefits for pensioners, ï¿½ï¿½40bn on disability benefits and ï¿½ï¿½14bn on child benefit.. For UC claimants required to work, the minimum number of hours was increased from 15 to 18, on Monday 13 May.. The rule change means 180,000 people will have to work more or risk losing their benefits, the Department for Work and Pensions says.. The 18-hour minimum applies to people earning the National Living Wage (ï¿½ï¿½11.44 for those aged 21 or over).. Someoneur can work fewer hours, as long as their total earnings meet a level called the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET)..

Sunak sets out plans to tackle 'sick note culture'. If a couple is earning less than ï¿½ï¿½1,437 between them, they will be expected to try to increase their earnings.. Claimants already risk having their benefits reduced if they don't take steps to earn more and meet regularly with a work coach.. Certain groups will remain exempt from sanctions - including people who can't work because of long-term sickness, or a disability.. Turn2Us has claimed government plans to speed up the roll-out of UC - and bring down spending on welfare - could affect vulnerable people disproportionately. . The government says its plans are necessary to get more people back in work and boost the economy, as levels of long-term sicknesncreased.. It claims that changes it is phasing in for the welfare system as a whole could save ï¿½ï¿½4bn a year. . Labour, however, says the Conservatives' failure to tackle problems facing the NHS, such as long waiting lists, should be prioritised instead.. The amount you get depends on whether you are single, or claiming as a couple, and your age. There is one standard allowance per household:. Single claimant under 25: ï¿½ï¿½311.68 a month. Single claimant 25 or over: ï¿½ï¿½393.45 a month. Joint claimants both under 25: ï¿½ï¿½489.23 a month. Joint claimants either aged 25 or over: ï¿½ï¿½617.60 a month. You may be entitled to extra money if, for example, you have children. . Extra money may also be available for rent payments, which works in different ways across the UK. . You may also be able to claim a reduction in council tax, external while on UC, or assistance to pay your mortgage, external, although you would need to meet strict criteria. . Under the UC taper, payments are reduced as claimants earn mer ""rate"" is 55%. . This means that for every additional ï¿½ï¿½1 earned over the work allowance, external, UC payments are reduced by 55p.. It is complicated to work out exactly how much UC you might receive. . Some people have found they are entitled to less money under UC than they would have been under the previous benefit arrangements. . Those with ï¿½ï¿½16,000 or more in savings are not eligible.. It usually takes about five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible.. An application for UC may put a stop to any tax credits you receive, even if it proves to be unsuccessful.. 'One click and I was worse off' from benefit claim. The main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work is new-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA)., external. This is worth ï¿½ï¿½71.70 a week if you are under 25, or ï¿½ï¿½90.50 a week if you are 25 or over..

There was speculation in the run-up to the 2023 Budget that the second increase would be brought forward, potentially to the late 2030s. .

bbc.com,When will interest rates come down?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57764601,2024-05-22 11:39,"The Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% in May, but cuts are expected later in the year, as inflation continues to fall.. Interest rates affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK.. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it.. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money.. This influences what other banks charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, and the interest they pay on savings.. The Bank of England moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - the increase in the price of something over time.. When inflation is high, the Bank - which has a target to keep inflation at 2% - may decide to raise rates.. The idea is to encourage people to spend less, to help bring inflation down by reducing demand.. Once this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them.. The Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 16 years.. However, it was higher than this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and was 17% in November 1979, external.. There have been questions about why interest rates have not been cut, as inflation is now much lower than its peak of 11.1% in October 2022.. It was 2.3% in April, down sharply from the March figure due to a drop in energy prices.. Speaking after May's decision to keep interest rates at 5.25%, the Bank's governor Andrew Bailey said he was ""optimistic that things are moving in the right direction"".. But he said the Bank needed to ""see more evidence"" that price rises had slowed further before cutting interest rates.. He left open the possibility of an interest rate cut at its next meeting on 20 June.  . However, inflation in the services sector - which includes everything from hospitality to hairdressing - remains higher than expected, so some experts think a cut later in the summer is more likely. .

bbc.com,How do I know if my smart meter is broken?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68664200,2024-03-26 15:17,"Almost four million smart meters in Great Britain were not working at the end of 2023, according to government data.. Faulty meters can mean customers rely on estimated bills, with some paying too much and struggling to get their money back.. Smart meters measure how much gas and electricity you use. You get one meter for each energy supply.. They can record half-hourly price and consumption data, external and automatically send readings to your energy supplier at least once a month.. According to the Energy Saving Trust, this means you will be billed accurately for the energy you've used.. Smart meters usually come with an in-home display, which can help you track how much energy you're using.. Almost four million smart meters not working properly. Smart meters don't use your wifi.. Instead, they include a communications hub which connects the smart meter to the in-home display as well as a secure national smart meter network.. This lets smart meters talk to different energy suppliers, says Ofgem.. Some earlier smart meters use the 3G network instead.. In-home displays, which update every 30 minutes for gas and in near real-time for electricity, external, don't affect the readings supplied to your energy company, external.. All smart meters have to be officially approved and their accuracy is monitored, external, the UK government says.. Smart Energy GB, a government-backed non-profit organisation supporting the use of smart meter technology, says they are as accurate as traditional meters, external.. According to government figures, there were almost 35 million smart meters in homes and businesses, external across Great Britain at the end of 2023. . Almost four million of those were not working properly, according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.. This means they were not operating in ""smart mode"" and sending readings to suppliers.. Martin Lewis says he believes one in five smart meters don't work. However, Martin Lewis, from MoneySavingExpert, told the BBC Radio 4 PM programme that meters with other problems - such as those sending the wrong readings, or a fault with the in-home display - should also be included in the government statistics. . This would mean that about one in five smart meters don't work, he said.. Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, says suppliers must replace faulty meters. . Unusual bills, sometimes caused by connectivity issues, and a blank screen on the meter can be signs it is not working correctly.. Your bill will also contain information that could help you find out.. According to Which?, readings on your bill should be marked ""smart"", external. . If they are marked with an ""e"", they're estimated readings, says Citizens Advice.. You can also use its smart checker tool, external to see if there is a problem between the meter and the central network.. You should contact your supplier - it should help you fix your meter.. If they fail to do so within eight weeks, Ofgem has a guide on how to complain to the Energy Ombudsman., external It advises taking manual meter readings in the meantime. . Customers who are concerned about paying their bill should also talk to their energy provider. Suppliers are required to offer tailored repayment plans and, where appropriate, payment holidays, Ofgem said.. You can also request an independent test of your meter, external, says Smart Energy GB.. Although it is free, you may have to pay your supplier for organising it if your meter is found to be working correctly.. The government says this was the case for the vast majority of meters tested in 2021. . What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?. What is the energy price cap?. Conventional energy meters need to be replaced every 10 to 20 years and most suppliers no longer install non-smart versions.. However, it is not compulsory to have a smart meter unless your current meter is faulty or at the end of its working life, says Ofgem.. You can therefore choose not to accept an offer to have one fitted. . However, if you refuse, you might find it hard to access all tariffs, external, according to Citizens Advice.. In general, suppliers must install a smart meter if they are replacing a meter or installing a meter for the first time, external, such as in a new property, says Ofgem..

bbc.com,Energy bills predicted to fall by 7% in July,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51nykexzj8o,2024-05-17 11:47,"Domestic energy bills are predicted to fall by a further 7% in July, offering some relief to households struggling with their budgets.. The bill for a home using a typical amount of gas and electricity could drop from ï¿½ï¿½1,690 a year to ï¿½ï¿½1,574, according to consultancy Cornwall Insight.. That follows previous falls and would mean a typical annual bill could be ï¿½ï¿½500 down on last summer.. The energy regulator, Ofgem, will announce the level of the quarterly price cap from July on 24 May.. Ofgem's latest quarterly price cap affects 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. Rules are different in Northern Ireland, where prices are also falling.. The price cap sets the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity but not the total bill - so if you use more, you will pay more.. Energy prices are already at their lowest level since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but - even with this predicted fall - would remain higher than pre-pande""We must recognise lower prices don't erase all the problems,"" said Craig Lowrey, from Cornwall Insight. . ""The very fact we are still seeing bill levels which are hundreds of pounds above pre-crisis levels underscores the ongoing challenges faced by households."". Looking further ahead, the consultancy has forecast bills would go up slightly in October before falling again the following January.. Ofgem is gathering views on the way the price cap is calculated, including whether there should be a change to standing charges.. They are the fixed daily charges covering the costs of connecting to a supply, which have risen sharply in some areas.. A fall in energy bills would feed through to the rate of inflation, and may create more impetus for the Bank of England to reduce interest rates.. Read more here.

bbc.com,How to get a job: Six expert tips for finding work,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64939070,2024-04-16 11:11,"If you're on the hunt for a job and not sure where to start, or how to pitch yourself you're not alone.. The rising cost of living has meant thousands of businesses have been laying off staff, with many people finding themselves out of work. . But about 10.8 million people, external are out of work, either unemployed or classed as economically inactive.. It may feel daunting to try and find a job at first so we spoke to some career experts to give you some tips.. There have been a lot of shifts in the workplace in recent years. Hybrid and flexible working means your job search can stretch a bit further, quite literally. . Yvonne Smyth, group head of diversity and inclusion at Hays Recruitment says ""Proximity isn't as important as used to be, so if you're looking for a job, search far and wide in terms of geography. . ""Also if you want to work part-time or say four days a week, don't let full-time positions put you off applying,"" she says.. ""Businesses are more flexible than you might think and if you're the right candidate that can get the job done in fewer days it makes sense for them to adapt the role."". Ms Smyth also says it's important to use key words when you're searching online.. ""For example if there's a key skill or industry like sales or retail that you're interested in, you want the algorithms on search platforms to pick up on them. . ""So daily searches on these words are important, so it identifies what you're interested in. . ""Engagement as well is key and that means clicking on jobs with the job titles or a company that you're keen on so the platform yields more of the same."". Not all jobs are made public. It's always worth sending an email or having a chat with a manager at a business that you like the look of, as you never know when an opening might be coming up. . Many businesses want to avoid the cost of advertising a job formally and may rely on word of mouth. . Miranda Kyte, a career trends expert at Glassdoor says: ""Another route is to utilise your network, let friends, ex-colleagues, family know that you're looking for a new position.. ""They may be able to check internal job boards for open roles at their own companies and refer you or they could know someone else who can help."". Lots of places still ask for a CV and a covering letter when you're applying for a job. . But now you can advertise yourself rather visibly via social media sites like Linkedin which showcase your skills and experience. . Other platforms like Twitter and Instagram can prove useful when touting yourself out to potential employers as well. . Yvonne Smyth from Hays says it's important to focus on skills.. ""Lots of people look at the years required on a job description but actually it's more important that a candidate has the right skills. Try to look for parallels and make that obvious in your application."" . It can be a little disheartening if the jobs you want require specific very specific qualifications. It may be worth having a look at if there are any ways of picking up the experience or training that you need to land a job while you're on the hunt. . Miranda Kyte from Glassdoor says: ""Lots of courses these days are free and you can do them online. Volunteering is also a great way of filling gaps on your CV or asking to do some work shadowing in companies you'd like to work for."". It's easy to get disheartened if you are knocked back after interviews time and time again, or you don't feel like you're getting through the door in the first place. . Our career experts say it's good to review how you're going about your search from time to time and try different approaches. . Career influencer, Mehar Sindhu Batra, says it's quite useful to set personal targets, like a tracker of the number of jobs to apply for in a week or a certain number of cold emails. . She's a big believer in acknowledging the little wins along the way to keep your spirits up. . ""Maybe you landed an interview, received positive feedback on your resume or cover letter, or connected with a helpful contact. Celebrating these wins can boost your confidence and keep you motivated"".. Six tips for getting a job if you're over 50. Five tips when asking for a pay rise.

bbc.com,Health leaders warn of 'catastrophic' cuts impacts,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg33qvv00n2o,2024-06-02 23:09,"Cutbacks in Northern Ireland's health service could have ""catastrophic impacts"", the chairs of the health and social care trusts have warned.. In a joint statement, the heads of NI's six trusts said they are ""deeply concerned at the financial outlook for the frontline services"" their organisations deliver.. ""It is our duty to warn of the very real potential for avoidable and serious harm being caused to people in our community who require our help, as a result of inadequate budgetary provision,"" they said.. The warning comes after the Department of Health (DoH) launched a consultation on its budget savings plans in May.. Its Permanent Secretary, Peter May, said the health service is currently facing unfunded spending pressures of ï¿½ï¿½472m, of which ï¿½ï¿½375m relates to a pay claim matching NHS England.. The chairs of NI's five regional health trusts and the NI Ambulance Service tru""intensive efforts are ongoing to deliver a significant level of savings this year"" and that ""even with these savings,"" a ""very significant shortfall remains that could only be filled by measures with high and catastrophic impacts"".. ""The reality is that without significant additional funding this year and longer-term financial security, the health service will be further destabilised and the public will bear the brunt,"" their statement added.. ""Such cutbacks would inevitably include bed closures as well as reductions in outpatient care, operating lists, domiciliary care and nursing care packages. . ""This would impact damagingly on the whole community in Northern Ireland, particularly the most vulnerable."". In February the devolved government in Northern Ireland was restored after a 24-month hiatus, during which there were no departmental ministers in place. . Chairman of the Western Trust Dr Tom Frawley told BBC News NI the absence of politicians had created difficulties regarding the transformation of Northern Ireland's health service.. ""The health service knows what the blueprint is, knows what it needs to do and has been developing the analysis to inform that,"" he said. ""But weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve had no politicians, who are required to make these judgements and finalise those judg"". Referring to strains on GP and pharmacy services as well as on hospitals, Dr Frawley said the ""whole system is under intense pressure and it is therefore not in a position to cope with a significant financial cut"".. He said ""crucial"" services will be impacted because of ""the level of cut thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s now being re"" of health trusts to make. . ""What worries me is that it is the most vulnerable who will suffer in these circumstances and those are the people we should be most concerned about,"" he added.. ""When you take a large sum of money out of the system then you reduce its capacity to respond to those pressures even further, with the implication that circumstances will become worse."" . The health trusts' warning comes after the chair of the Royal College of GPs in Northern Ireland said pressure on the health service means patients are either paying with ""their livelihoods or... their lives"".. Dr Ursula Mason said doctors cannot ""keep doing more and more with less and less"".. On Tuesday the Northern Ireland Assembly passed its first budget in three years, despite several parties voting against the move.. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the assembly's official opposition, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), refused to support it.. The previous UUP Health Minister, Robin Swann opposed it when it was agreed by other executive ministers in April.. The DoH got the largest share of day-to-day funding (ï¿½ï¿½7.8bn).. Mr Swann said that in voting against the budget, he acknowledged he would not be complying with the ministerial cod""I don't do that easily, but I have a greater responsibility to defend and protect vital services,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he s""That is why I and so many patients and health service workers took reassurance from the public statements, both before and after the restoration of the executive, that the health of our people was going to be prioritised.. ""I believe this budget does not achieve that."". In their statement the heads of NI's health trust said they ""are mindful of the growing budgetary pressures on all parts of the public sector"", but that their focus is on everyone in Northern Ireland who needs health and social care services.. ""We have a collective responsibility as leaders to highlight these concerns, on behalf of our dedicated workforce and all those who rely on the vital services our organisations provide,"" they added.. The incoming health minister said the role presents ""the ultimate political challenge"".. Almost 5,000 unpaid carers in Northern Ireland are having overpayments of the Carer's Allowance recovered from them.. Theï¿½ï¿½availability and cost of childcareï¿½ï¿½has become a significant issue for many parents and a political priority.. The law will mean that people born in or after 2009 will never be able to legally buy cigarettes.. Northern Ireland will get a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½needs-basedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ top up to its normal funding allocations..

However, Mr Swinney has called on the public to back his party's indy stance in the 4 July general election and use the vote as a direct way to remove the Conservatives from government.. He said: ""A combination of Westminster cuts and Brexit has reduced the money available for the NHS, other public services and housing.. ""Brexit alone has wiped billions from the Scottish economy compared with EU membership. And it's pushed up food and other household costs.. ""Given the UK is moving so badly in the wrong direction I would be failing in my duty if I did not set out what I believe is a better future for Scotland."". Following his election as first minister last month, Mr Swinney called for more respect to be shown in Scottish politics.. Looking ahead to the UK-wide general election, he said he believes in ""the politics of persuasion or, if that's not possible, respectful disagreement""..  He told those at the rally that ""in our wonderful, diverse, inspiring country"" everyone should have a chance to get on in life.. ""It's why I believe so strongly in eradicating child poverty,"" the first minister will say.. ""At this election it is those principles that will guide my approach. So I am asking people to vote SNP to remove the Tories from government.. ""I'm asking people to vote SNP to put Scotland's interests first. I'm asking people to vote for a future made in Scotland, for Scotland."". Mr Swinney also highlighted what the he said the SNP had achieved in government, including:. Analysis by Phil Sim, BBC Scotland political correspondent. John Swinneyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s calculation is that a Labour win is already priced in for many in this election.. At his launch event, he predicted that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the Tories are on course for a huge defeat, a wipeoutï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. The pitch is that the Tories are toast anyway, and Labour will have a big majority - so Scots donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t actually need to vote for Labour to achieve that. Indeed, he says they should vote for the SNP to keep Labour honest - to hold their feet to the fire.. Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s painting them as already being complacent - ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½they think Scotland is in the bagï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.. The question is whether this message - that people can have a Labour government without actually voting Labour - will cut through with voters, compared to the rather more straightforward ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½changeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ narrative Sir Keir Starmer is selling.. Speaking on BBC Scotland's Tilton said his party was not talking about independence during this campaign ""because literally no-one on the doorsteps is talking about it - they donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"".. He added: ""We donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t believe there should be a second referendum ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not salient to p""People want to talk about getting access to a GP at the first time of asking, or NHS dentists in their locality.. ""They want to talk about taking the sewage out of our rivers and lifting up Scottish education to where it used to be."". Speaking on the campaign trail in Renfrew, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the SNP had spent the entire campaign so far attacking Labour when the real opportunity was to ""get rid of this rotten Tory government"".. He said: ""Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s what weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re focused on ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ getting rid of Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman and the whole, rot""People across Scotland realise after 14 years of corruption, chaos, lies and sleaze from the Conservative party that this is Scotlandï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s opportunity to get rid of them. And the only way we do that is if we elect a UK Labour gover"". Mr Sarwar said he was confident previous SNP supporters would switch to Labour on 4 July.. ""I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t care how you voted in the past. I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t care how you voted in the referendum. I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t care how you would possibly vote in fut""What I care about just now is getting rid of this rotten Tory government, so letï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s go on this part of the journey together and change our co"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr Swinney had made ""a desperate attempt"" to relaunch the SNPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s election cam""in the wake of his shameful mishandling of the Michael Matheson scandal"".. Mr Matheson - a former health secretary - was last week handed a record ban from parliament for breaching Holyrood's expenses policy. . And police are now assessing a new complaint over the SNP MSP's ï¿½ï¿½11,000 iPad data roaming bill.. Douglas Ross said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Predictably, he (Mr Swinney) used it to double down on the SNPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s independence obsession, instead of focusing on the peopleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s real priorities ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As he showed in the Matheson scandal, John Swinney wil"". Mr Ross added: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Voters who have had enough of SNP incompetence and their endless sowing of division have the chance to punish them on Jul""In key seats across the country, only the Scottish Conservatives can beat the SNP and move the focus on to the issues that really matter.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

Kennedy Jr., the U.S. presidential candidate, spoke at a press conference Thursday at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas. Here are some of his comments:Donald Trump's guilty verdict""I'm going to talk about issues of broader concern. I want to focus on the economic issues and the health issues. That's what my campaign is about. I'm not going to get dragged into the dirt pile. I don't have any thoughts. I've been very disciplined in not talking about lawsuits against [Joe] Biden or Trump.""Read more: RFK Jr. Says Guilty Verdict May Help Trump's Election ProspectsThoughts on Trump's new pro-crypto stance""I'm happy about that. I think it's a good thing for our country. Commitment to crypto is a commitment to freedom and transparency. I'm not going to question if it was a political decision. I'm happy he did it, and I hope President Biden does, too.""Biggest issues facing crypto regulation in the U.S.""I think transactional freedom is one. We need sovereignty over our own wallets, transactional freedom and a currency that is transparent. We need to make sure America remains the hub of blockchain technology. I'm going to make sure cryptocurrency is regulated in a way that protects the consumer from deceptive schemes. I purchased 21 bitcoins since I started this campaign. I also bought three coins for each of my kids.""What does the future hold for crypto fans?""My objective if elected president is that crypto is a transactional currency. That people can have transactional freedom. That people have a choice as to whether they can buy it. I think it should be treated as a currency; we shouldn't be taxing it as capital gains. I think there are issues in how we do that. I believe that it should be a currency used to purchase things like apples, lunches and coffee and that people can do that.""What inspired him to run for president""I toyed with getting into politics when I was younger. For two decades I took that off the plate. I saw what happened during Covid and when the government shut down the economy. I thought it was wrong. The government shut down every church, attacked the 5th amendment, shut down business without due process ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ they shut down jury trials, they violated prohibitions and I saw this attack on the constitution and censorship, not just to me but so many people who were trying to talk. I saw that and it seemed so unethical to my country.

While President Bidenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s administration essentially carried over the same reluctant-to-the-point-of-being-nearly-hostile approach to crypto as its predecessor, ever since the bottoming out of the industry in 2022 (the year from crypto hell) it has been actively hostile. The easiest way to sum up Bidenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½whole of governmentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ attempt to wrangle in the crypto industry is with the catchphrase Operation Choke Point 2.0, coined by VC Nic Carter to describe the apparent debanking of many crypto firms.Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteBut in a matter of week with the bipartisan vote in the House and Senate to repeal the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s (SEC) much-maligned accounting bulletin (SAB121) and extending to yesterdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s reveal that the Biden administration is reportedly doing outreach to crypto firms in a late-stage attempt to hear what they have to say about what good crypto policy would look like, it has become (nearly) believable that brighter days are ahead on the political, regulatory and legislative fronts for the domestic crypto industry.See also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis) The feeling is in the air, probably because everyone appears to be voicing it out loud. For instance, yesterday on the Consensus stage, NYSE President Lynn Martin said that she doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t think that crypto will remain a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½partisanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ issue much longer. In the same way that stock and bonds are mostly apolitical, it doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t really make much sense to view crypto as inherently political (in for actually being apolitical, given the technical design of protocols like Bitcoin).However, not everyone is in alignment here. For instance, a big name crypto lawyer who works for a red hot DeFi startup, who asked not to be named given the sensitivity of his work, said he doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t think Bidenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s apparent change of heart is genuine. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll likely revert back to course, if reelected,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said. Asked whether he felt any weight off his shoulders at all, or whether his job has or will get any easier, under seemingly improving regulatory conditions, he said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½absolutely not.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Today is the same as yesterday.Austin Campbell, a Columbia University business lecturer who is plugged into the D.C. circuit, echoed this idea when noting that the seemingly parallel change in Congress is not likely permanent. In fact, if you look at how the voting on the landmark Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) happened, it largely broke down on age litive, given that younger members of Congress are more likely to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½get it,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and despite the fact that U.S. politics is a gerontocracy, the dinosaurs wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t rule the world forever.This morning, Messari founder Ryan Selkis, who recently spoke with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago Club, and Uniswap Labs chief lawyer Marvin Ammori, a longtime Democratic operative, actually debated the recent political machinations afoot on the Main Stage. Selkisï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ main argument was that any easing up on crypto by the Democrats is largely a result of Trump capturing the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½single issueï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ crypto vote, and that it should be treated as suspect. While Ammori argued that political changes donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t flip like a switch, and that things like SAB121 and FIT21 were the result of real bipartisan collaboration and successful crypto lobbying.See also: Trump Widens Lead Over With Biden (on Polymarket and PredictIt) After Courting Crypto Voteï¿½ï¿½ï¿½My point is, we don't necessarily want to be pang term,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Ammori said. In other words, crypto should be wary of aligning itself with any one party or any one candidate ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ especially considering that campaign promises are rarely kept. For his part, Selkis wanted to step out of wishful thinking (i.e., that Democrats could be suddenly supportive of crypto after so many years) and into the realm of realpolitik (i.e., that if the theory of bipartisan support were true, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d be because Demsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ needs have shifted).ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Democrats right now are like a cheating spouse; we caught them with their pants down,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Selkis said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½To reward this Democrat, mainstream party at this point in time is not only foolish, but I think it shows a profound lack of se"

Yet, he insists that the rules are very clear and don't need updating,"" he said.In 2022, the SEC kept confidential emails and notes from William Hinman's 2018 speech, which declared ether not a security. Ripple, sued by the SEC, obtained access to these redacted documents, revealing extensive internal SEC discussions about ether's status as a security.The U.S., the world's largest economy, represents, in Garlinghouse's opinion, the ""bottom decile of regulatory clarity.""""Somehow, [Gensler] believes that the Orange Grove tests from 70-80 years ago provide clear rules for crypto,"" he said, referring to the Howey Test's Floridian roots. ""It makes no sense and is a travesty because the SEC's stance has become such a political liability, affecting even the presidential race.""Garlinghouse also mentioned that last year 75% of Rippple's hiring was outside the U.S., and this year it's about 60%, with major offices in London, Geneva and Singapore.The hiring trends reflect Ripple's focus on regulatory clarity and customer locations, he said.""Getting the regulatory posture right in the United States is just critical,"" he concluded.Edited by Nick Baker."
