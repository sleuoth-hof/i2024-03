coindesk.com,The Untold Story Behind Beeple's Historic NFT Sale: 'Token Supremacy' Excerpt,https://www.coindesk.com//consensus-magazine/2024/05/24/the-untold-story-behind-beeples-historic-nft-sale-token-supremacy-excerpt/,2024-05-24 20:48,"Mike Winkelmann sank into the sofa as three cameras recorded his meltdown. The dueling identities that had once structured his life were coming into conflict as his fortunes increased by the second. Unseen crypto billionaires were bidding for his soul, or at least it felt that way. His entire artistic career was being auctioned as a compilation of five thousand digital artworks, packaged by the Christie���s auctioneers as a single non-fungible token (NFT). The winner would receive this NFT as an online certificate of ownership, a deed to 14 years inside Winkelmann���s mind. It was surreal watching his own coronation from the couch. The new crypto king was slack jawed as his net worth continued to rise by the millions on the computer screen, reckoning with the transformation of his art into an ultimate use-case for blockchain technology, bringing the metaverse into the mainstream. Two documentary crews captured his euphoric stupor, memorializing the tight choreography of this historic moment.Zacharew York Times reporter writing about the art world's relationship to money, politics and technology, is the author of ""Token Supremacy: THE ART OF FINANCE, THE FINANCE OF ART, AND THE GREAT CRYPTO CRASH OF 2022,"" published by Penguin Random House.(Penguin Random House)The artist had become a multimillionaire at that moment. It was too much to bear, and suddenly he was bolting for the out door patio, away from the living room, where his family had gathered to celebrate his success. Winkelmann needed some air.Once upon a time, the promise of a divided life held some appeal. Mike owned a lucrative business turning digital graphics and animations into branded visuals for clients like Louis Vuitton, Apple and Justin Bieber. The money he earned from those productions allowed him to live in the McMansion suburbs outside of Charleston, South Carolina. He fit comfortably there into the patterns of home, work, and hobby. He was popular with the neighbors, a plucky midwestern transplant with a wide smile, a sailor���s mouth, and a heart of gold. He would sometimes rant about politics, but otherwise focused on family, sitting pretty in a large home overlooking the palmetto trees. Mike understood the value of compartmentali, because his parents taught him midwestern manners and the importance of staying reserved in the middle-class Wisconsin village where he was born. So he kept his more libidinal thoughts inside a computer running so hot that it needed to be stored in the bathroom on a wood platform over the tub, near a jury-rigged industrial A/C unit that vented its heat into the attic.The computer expended its vast amounts of energy trying to contain Beeple, the internet crap monster responsible for Winkelmann���s cult online following. He adopted the name in 2003, after a 1980s toy that looked like the abandoned love child of Sasquatch and Chewbacca, with light sensors that triggered its blinking nose and squeaky voice whenever its eyes were covered by a hand. Winkelmann had just graduated with a computer-science degree from Purdue University in Indiana, but he found programming ���boring as sh*t.��� The 22-year-old was more interested in shooting narrative short films through a webcam than working for a she Beeple toy came to symbolize his fascination with the interplay of light and sound.In 2007, Beeple started a project that would eventually make him famous. The ""Everydays"" series began as a daily drawing habit of crude little doodles that seemed to betray his more corporate, Bill Gates appearance. The drawings were the crass products of a mind feeding on internet bile (racist caricatures, nude women, penis jokes, political satire) and tutored by magical realism (family portraits, animal studies, Jesus smoking cigarettes, Hillary Clinton wearing gold teeth). A year later, Beeple switched to Cinema4D, an animation software that allowed him to manipulate three-dimensional space. For the kid who spent hours at Toys ���R��� Us playing a demo of Super Mario��64 on the new Nintendo console, it was a dream come true to create realistic worlds on a computer. But it wasn���t until around 2011 that he started fully utilizing the program to experiment with bright colors and blurry shapes with names like Synthetic Bubblegum Tittufux. Around the same time, Beeple started releasing music videos made with Cinema4D as free source material for creative professionals; the aopular his creations had become only when, on a family vacation to Hong Kong, he saw one of his works projected outside a Hard Rock Cafe.A recognizable style finally emerged in 2017, when Beeple fully articulated his fascination with tech dystopias. Importing digital assets from other websites allowed him to createmore detailed scenes in only a couple hours. His imagination exploded with skyscrapers stacked atop cargo containers, Santa Claus clones brawling to the death, and cultists worshipping an original Macintosh computer. Celebrity sightings abound in these nihilistic tales of the future: Donald Trump���s head opens to reveal a burger brain; Mickey Mouse holds a machine gun; and Buzz Lightyear lactates in the park.See also: Beeple Sold Out. So What?All that chaos was contained in Winkelmann���s computer, sitting on a desk with its cables running into the bathroom hotbox. His home office was largely undecorated, with beige carpeting, Walmart bookshelves, and two 65-inch screen televisions thatand Fox News on mute throughout the day. He was neither the first artist to adopt lowbrow culture (Marcel Duchamp beat him there by nearly a century when he exhibited a signed urinal in 1917) nor the first to immerse himself in mass media (Andy Warhol and his silkscreens of Marilyn Monroe might like a word). What made Beeple special was his evangelism for digital art, his embodiment of the internet���s tendency toward dark absurdism, and his eagerness to build an economy around it. He had already cultivated a network of nearly two million followers on Instagram, and artist friends were repeatedly bugging him to start releasing NFTs. Why not try something new?Beeple had everything to gain and nothing to lose. In late October 2020, days before the presidential election, he released three artworks on the NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway. One piece was c""Politics Is Bullshit,"" featuring a diarrheic bull tattooed with an American flag with a Twitter bird perched upon its neck. The initial offer for this edition of 100 images was just $1.00 each.���If you need extra convincing from some BS artist���s notes wether you want to spend a dollar on this i will punch you in the god damn face,��� Beeple wrote about the offering in the lowercase, typo-ridden idiom of internetspeak. ���Smash the buy button ya jabroni.���Poof. All gone. Sold. The two other NFTs offered, including one from a video series called Crossroads, went for $66,666.66 each. Even with such a devilish price ��� decided upon with the whimsy of a speculative market willing to spend whatever ��� Winkelmann could identify his salvation in the metaverse. The most he had ever made from his artworks was $100 for a small print. Now the artist saw a potential avenue for financializing his digital art, one that built upon the lucrative market for online collectibles that companies like Dapp with the release of CryptoKitty and CryptoPunk NFTs. Executives behind those products had predicted that digital art would find online buyers, and within the two-month period from November to January 2018, CryptoKitties made $52 million. Mack Flavelle, a founder of the CryptoKitties project, pointed out why: ���There���s not that much that people can do with cryptocurrency,��� he told the New York Times reporter Scott Reyburn at the time. ���We gave them something fun and useful to do with their Ethereum.���Winkelmann���s success seemed to fulfill the prophecy that individual artists would benefit from the cryptoeconomy. But the business developers behind crypto companies were looking for the kind of legitimization that no amount of advertising could attain, and collectibles by themselves felt like little more than a bubble. They wanted the approval of legacy companies.They wanted permanence. They wanted cultural capital.In 2017, Christie���s made a Renaissance paint of postwar and contemporary art. The anachronism was supposed to convey the immediacy of the artwork���s appeal, even if art historians were more skeptical about its authenticity; nevertheless, the auction house described Salvator Mundi as a genuine Leonardo da Vinci painting, and it sold for a record $450.3 million to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. The price overtook the previous benchmark, set by a Picasso painting in 2015, by almost triple. Gasps from the salesroom confirmed the event as peak spectacle, made even more ridiculous in the coming years, as Salvator Mundi remained locked inside the crown prince���s yacht; he refused to exhibit the painting publicly, allegedly because he feared that museums might downgrade the work as belonging to a Leonardo assistant instead of the master himself.Restructuring continued in 2020, as Christie���s announced that it would merge its impressionist and modern and contemporary art departments into one office. ���Our clients don��nt,��� Guillaume Cerutti, chief executive at the auction house, told reporters at the time.The decision came at a time when impressionist and modern sales were performing far below their postwar and contemporary competitors. Combining the departments would dump collectors into one pool, changing the dynamics of the market and pushing tastes toward the present. It suddenly seemed that the most expensive artworks had paint dripping off the canvas; the artists were oftentimes women and people of color, and they were in their 30s and 40s ��� shocking for an industry that had exclusively prized dead white men for the majority of its existence. Sales of art sold within three years of its creation date grew 1,000% over the past decade to almost $260 million.Ironically, the arrival of the ultra-contemporary market occurred around the same time that Christie���s announced that it""20th Century Evening Sale"" in October 2020 would be the remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex, nicknamed Stan, which ended up selling for $31.8 million, the most ever paid for a fossil at the time.Many employees were bitter about the changes; they rolled their eyes at the little anachronisms that had become headliners. It was a successful marketing gimmick by the bigwigs to grab attention in a moment when the pandemic economy seemed on the verge of daily collapse. Those who joined the auction house to nerd out on art history hated this new approach, but others, with a sense for business, thrived in the controlled chaos.See also: Robert Alice Made NFT History, Now He's Writing About It���I have always felt like I am living in the theater of the absurd,��� Davis later confided in me. He relished the ridiculous nature of his industry. The auction world was a system of meaningless sales records, an illusion of competition that often boiled down to a handful of rich men who all knew one another competing over the bragging rights of ownoisseurship was dead. Provenance was a mirage. Dinosaur bones were being sold next to Rothko and Picasso paintings.���All I know is that I know nothing,��� Davis said, adding that the motto was actually a paraphrase of something Socrates once said and a lyric from a song called ���Knowledge��� by the California punk band Operation Ivy.So, when the salesman considered all the strange circumstances surrounding him, auctioning an NFT sounded perfectly reasonable. ���It will be fun and a little weird,��� he predicted. The auction was less than two months away, and everyone supporting the NFT sale had something to prove. Meghan Doyle, a researcher, and Ryoma Ito, the chief marketing officer, started working around the clock, feeling pressure to create the perfect auction. But the most important detail was still missing: what was Beeple going to make? The artist ""Everydays"" to commemorate 14 years of working on the project.���Cool, but maybe not as epic as it should be,��� Doyle said, declining the proposal.Winkelmann returned with a new idea. ���I had hit this perfect milestone in this massive project,��� he remembered. ���And I had just happened to hit 5,000 days of making art.��� Instead of offering a single work, he decided to combine everything he had created over the last fourteen years into a single""EVERYDAYS,"" a collage of all his work up to that date. (Christie's)���He came back to us with a magnum opus,��� Doyle said. ���With that image in hand, we were able to rally the support that we needed to develop content around the piece and get advertisements in the newspaper. We had a complete story, a complete picture.���However, Ito found the level of involvement from Christie���s marketing department lacking. Understanding the stakes of this auction for his company, he started trying to make his own luck through outreach with private collectors ��� ���whales,��� as they are called in the crypto community. Vignesh Sundaresan was one of the first names on his list.In January, Sundaresan could be found on the virtual disco floor with a champagne glass floating about the head of his digital avatar. He was partying hard in the metaverse to celebrate his $2.2-million purchase of twenty Beeple NFTs and the opening of a gallery that he had commissioned Web architects to build e was operating under a mysterious persona named MetaKovan, which translates from his native Tamil language into ���King of Meta.���Sundaresan was a serial entrepreneur in the crypto industry; he had gained his affinity for decentralized finance after a childhood in the Indian city of Chennai, where he dreamed of becoming the next Steve Jobs. He was born there in 1988, and came of age alongside the World Wide Web, which had been released the following year. Then there were a series of false starts, including the creation of ���Bitcoin ATMs,��� which enabled users to deposit physical cash and receive crypto, and a trading platform called Lendroid, which blew through its $48 million in funding within two years.In 2019, Sundaresan started investing heavily in digital properties, buying a digital representation of a diamond-studded Formula One car for an online racing game, NFT artworks and hundreds of acres in the digital real-estate market. A year later, he started using the name MetaKovs his ���exosuit��� created for ���building the metaverse.���At the virtual party in January, Sundaresan, now 33, unveiled a fund called Metapurse for investing in NFTs. The 20 Beeple artworks that he had purchased were bundled into a single asset called B.20, which was then fractionalized into ten million tokens. Buyers of the tokens were told that this would denote ownership over the metaverse���s first large-scale public art project.���We were inspired by the idea of not only being able to own historic artwork, like the Mona Lisa, but also being able to own the museum it was displayed in, and then sharing that ownership and experience with the public,��� the company said in its newsletter. ���Making money with art is fairly simple and not very imaginative. What we want to do is to decentralize and democratize art.���Ito had been watching Sundaresan for a while; he understood how the crypto millionaire operated and that he had an affinity for the gutturatant, MetaKovan wanted to leverage NFTs as a financial instrument. He was exactly the kind of person who might want to send a message about the power of digital art by spending millions on an image.Gradually, Sundaresan was coaxed into the process. He had some initial worries about going through the Christie���s ���know your customer��� process, an anti-money-laundering rule that ensures that companies keep records on the essential facts of their buyers and sellers. He expressed his reservations to Ito, fearing that he would be unmasked as MetaKovan because of the digital identity trail. But, eventually, he came to accept that this was a risk involved in doing business with an established auction house, even if the majority of bidders remain anonymous to the public unless they choose to reveal themselves. He was joined by his cofounder at Metapurse ��� another Indian crypto investor, Anand Venkateswaran ��� who played more of a backseat advisory role in the acquisition process.Thstie���s, which had initially been slow to support the sale, finally kicked into action. Winkelmann���s NFT idea had been rebranded into an event with its own subtitle, like an Avenger""Everydays: The First 5000 Days."" Doyle was receiving increasing numbers of emails from crypto collectors expressing their interest in placing a bid. The artwork had been published without a price range; instead, the auction house chose to write ���estimate unknown,��� a cheeky nod to the usual ���inquire for estimate��� phrase implying that anyone needing to ask was too poor to buy.���Estimate unknown.��� That was the truth. Winkelmann had prepared himself for the NFT to sell for somewhere near $1 million. Ito had the same gut feeling. It wasn���t until a few days before the sale, as reporters started asking if they were prepared to sell for tens of millions, that the team realized something profound was about to happen.���Noah looked at me and said, ���We are about to throw a grenade on the art world,��� ��� Winkelmann recalled.Compliance officers and executives at Christie���s were still debating the financial terms of the deal. The original plan was for the house to ium fee be paid in dollars; however, sale organizers worried that such an arrangement would discourage crypto whales from participating in the auction.Success needed to be measured with the company���s longterm goals for growth. Accepting cryptocurrency would invite scrutiny from the press, traditional collectors and government regulators; it could also be a financial risk, depending on the volatile prices of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). What ultimately became clear to decision makers was that nothing about this sale could be half-assed. Big money often requires big leaps of faith.���A decision was made at the highest levels to take the whole thing in cryptocurrency,��� Doyle said. ���The amount of cogs in the wheel for that to happen was truly mind-blowing.���The gamble worked, and the tidal waves of inquiries about the Beeple sale never stopped. Sundaresan had already confirmed his participation in the auction, but what nobody expected was another competitor willing to particus online bidding wars that the auction house had ever seen.On February 25, 2021, the auction began with a $100 opening bid. Within eight minutes, the price had reached $1 million.���I was shocked that our website could handle it,��� Doyle said. ���I had never seen that happen.���The auction had already reached the threshold for bidders at which the prospective buyers needed to be cleared financially, often with letters of references from the crypto exchanges supporting their transactions. There were nearly two dozen hopeful buyers at that point, 18 of whom were entirely new to Christie���s. Most were millennials.See also: What's Next for Beeple After Dizzying $69M NFT Sale?���It was a psychotic amount of bidding,��� Davis thought as his phone started blowing up with messages. His boss, Alex Rotter, head of 20th-and-21st-century art, even took to social media to brag about the sale. He posted a Beeple artwork to his Instagram featuring a superpowered Homer Simpson lobr vision.���Beeple leads the way,��� Rotter captioned the image. ���It���s all happening.���This excerpt has been lightly"

coindesk.com,Audrey Tang: Learning From Taiwan���s Digital Civic Experimen,https://www.coindesk.com//consensus-magazine/2024/05/22/audrey-tang-learning-from-taiwans-digital-civic-experimentation/,2024-05-22 21:19,"A new political philosophy has entered the chat.���Plurality,��� the title and central subject of a new book by Microsoft���s internal economist Glen Weyl and Taiwan���s former (as of yesterday) Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang, is the idea that collaboration-enhancing technologies should be more widely embraced both by the public and state. Societies should learn to cherish a wider range of viewpoints, the authors argue, and one of the ways to foster that state of mind is through technologies ��� perhaps blockchains ��� that enable us to come together.The book is essentially a coda to Tang���s career as a public servant as well as an outgrowth of Weyl���s previous techno-political theory meant to counter the malaise overtaking a world beset by wealth inequality and economic stagnation, laid out in ���Radical Markets.��� Tang, who entered public office to help advance Taiwan���s digital developments in 2016 (and was appointed its first dtour to speak about the theory of Plurality and educate politicians on Taiwan���s groundbreaking civic digital experiments.You may be asking yourself how it is that advocating for a diversity of opinions, healthy civic debate and technology is a novel political strategy. And you���d be right! But what sets Plurality apart is Tang���s tangible experience running large scale, open-source, public, digital infrastructure projects like the g0v project (pronounced Gov Zero), which created open source and interactive alternatives of Taiwan���s government websites, and vTaiwan, which enabled citizens to petition for policies.In other words, there is praxis to Tang and Weyl���s theory ��� a goal in action. Weyl has described Plurality as something similar to environmentalism; it only works if you do it. The dream is to get the whole world on-boarded onto this system, advancing democracy and open-source technological innovation simultaneously. The book itself is a working example of ith a number of co-authors, the book is freely available to all (here) and something they hope to add to over time.See also: Changemaker: Glen Weyl Puts His Radical Ideas Into Action���Our project will be carried out in conjunction with Plurality research and implementation,��� Tang and Weyl write in an announcement post. ���We don't just need hackers and writers, we need designers, storytellers, marketers and distributors to work with us. Under no circumstances will Glen and Audrey receive any compensation or royalties for writing this book, in keeping with the legal code that accompanies their positions; revenue will only be used to support the community and philanthropic mission we hope to build.���CoinDesk caught up with Tang (who by all accounts has had a fascinating life, which was detailed yesterday in a TIME profile and will soon be the subject of a documentary) to discuss the writing of the book, how to convince governments to embrace progressive technology and what it means tcestor.���This interview has been edited for length and clarity.To start off with an easy one: What was it like writing a book with Glen Weyl?So the book actually started two years ago even before I was appointed as minister of digital affairs. So in a sense, it grew with the ministry. As you understand, our ministry got started when the unprovoked war on Kyiv happened, when people suddenly started to care about resilience. And so a lot of the ideas from the book, like IPFS, decentralization and Web3 for redundancy, suddenly became a topic of focus when our ministry first started a year and a half ago.I think it's both very practical that those cutting edge ideas get used in Taiwan, and also highly enjoyable in the sense that people care about Taiwan. But they may not know how a civic tech ecosystem functions or how the state can fund a lot of decentralized technology as public infrastructure in the same way it builds highways and bridges.There was a lot of mutual learning. I would also point out that asult of co-writing this book, both Vitalik Buterin and Glen have become residents of Taiwan. They got gold cards, which we hand out for anyone who contributes for 8 years or more to open source or any of the internet commons.For people who would hear the gist of the book and assume that it's another form of technical libertarianism, could you describe exactly what you mean by ���plurality?���Sure, so plurality means collaborative diversity, right? It means technology that fosters diversity. So in that sense, it is a little bit similar to the idea of decentralization where everybody can host their own systems. But there's another dimension of effective collaboration and coordination, which we loosely refer to as democracy but it's not about just voting. It is about a continuous form of democracy that allows, for example, AI facilitated deliberation between people holding very conflicting ideas to build bridges for people who were originally ideologically opposed.See also: CFTC Commissioner Summer MOverzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative ActionI would say this form of collaboration sounds a little bit technocratic, that diversity sounds a little bit libertarian, but it is a unique combination of the two ��� collaborative diversity ��� that sets plurality apart.So I liked the book. It was a love letter to Taiwan in some sense, but how would you best persuade governments outside of Taiwan to adopt these democratic experimentations?Well, first of all, I think we learn from a lot of other governments as well. Our reputation system came from Reykjavik, Iceland. Our participatory budget system came from Barcelona. And of course, we were inspired by the internet consultation in Brazil from more than 10 years ago. And so there's a long tradition of working with internet technologies, not for the government to govern the internet, but using internet technologies to improve the governance of government itself.What Taiwan can contribute here is that we have advanced some of the more,, resilient defenses against polarization attacks, you know, information manipulation attacks, deep fakes, transnational fraud and pandemic misinformation ��� you name it. For example, we've managed to overcome the polarization tied to our January election, without people hating each other.That's partly thanks to participatory fact checking, where we set up a community with 1000s of contributors and music to spread the idea of super fact checking. So as you can see, in any jurisdiction where there are similar threats or a similar urgency for clarity, these ideas take hold and the grassroots community just grows from there.Just off of the idea of crowdsourcing truth. X has a version of it. Do you think these different programs are better run by the government or by private corporations?Yeah, I think that the greatest thing about Community Notes is that it really is open source. I remember Vitalik set up his own node to verify what x.com did was correct. So because it's open source, you can think of it aser. Imagine, not just for x.com, but for anybody in the fedi-verse where you can conceivably you can build a Community Notes, including Threads and other things, and in a sense making this not just a jury duty of sorts, but rather making it a alternate entry point where the Committee Notes are the default for the various different social platforms.So to your question, I see it working as a bridging system across different social networks and that the state should fund it, of course, but not control it. This is in a sense like funding running water for civil discourse, because if there is no such layer, then polarization is the default for the current generation of the social web.Responding to some of the like blockchain critics, how can the blockchain world help devise protocols that look more plural pluralistic rather than plutocratic?I think a healthy ecosystem in the blockchain world is one that is not dominated by a single implementation, right? So of course Ethereum itself has multiple implementations and also on different layer 2 solutions. I have in mind, for example, the Polkadot system, which is a distinct ecosystem, building on a kind of common meta-protocol. We need to get people to better understand that crypto really follows a toolkit approach, like the fact that you can reuse most of the governance protocols and enjoy cross-chain coordination. I think this is something that we in traditional politics find it difficult to imagine.Of course, there are things like gold cards that give people residency across multiple jurisdictions that kind of approximate this, but it is still not as nimble or mobile as, for example, Gitcoin is as far as that can identify people across multiple social presences. These examples serve as a very important proof of concept. So that when new governments start looking at quadratic voting, project funding and all sorts of ways coordination could be more thorough, they can point to those already working on-chain examples and say, ���oh, let's just copy that��� inst research from scratch.So the Daily Beast wrote a piece saying that some of Taiwan's civil tech experimentations are seeing decreasing use.Yeah, they decreased during the pandemic. That is true.I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond because I don���t think I saw a quote from you.I think it's up to the vTaiwan community to explain what happened during the pandemic and what happened after. If you want a quote, actually, because the Plurality book is co-written with them, you can just read their accountChapter 2-2, has a very comprehensive response, saying that, and I quote, ���As a decentralized, citizen-led community, vTaiwan is also a living organism that naturally evolves and adapts as citizen volunteers participate in various ways. The community���s engagement experienced a downturn following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted face-to-face meetings and led to decreased participation. The platform faced challenges due to the intensive volunteering effort required,ndates for governmental responses, and its somewhat narrow focus. In response to these challenges, vTaiwan���s community has sought to find a new role between the public and the government and extend its outreach beyond the realm of Taiwanese regulation in recent years. A significant effort to revitalize vTaiwan was its collaboration with OpenAI���s Democratic Input to AI project in 2023. Through partnerships with Chatham House and the organization of several physical and online deliberative events centered on the topic of AI ethics and localization, vTaiwan successfully integrated local perspectives into the global discourse on AI and technology governance.���Then the next paragraphs say that today a second, related platform, Join, averages about more than 11,000 unique daily visitors. So while the state e-petition platform enjoyed slightly increasing participation during the pandemic because of the ease of online voting, vTaiwan���s reliance on weekly face to face meetups did experieow they're on a bounce back.So in a sense, you���re saying there was a natural evolution of people moving to different platforms, like the shift from MySpace to Facebook?I think the good thing about g0v [pronounced Gov-Zero] is that every project is by definition open source and part of Creative Commons. And so for new generations who want to revitalize vTaiwan, they do not have to start from scratch.See also: Ethereum's New Radical: Glen Weyl Isn't Vitalik But He's Its Next Best HopeOf course, the vTaiwan community today is not the same community at launch in 2014. All of us who were part of the original thing are still around, but the people who are running it are like 10 years younger than us now. And so, to your question, I think it is not just a migration thing. It is also how each generation thinks about experimentation. The original use of vTaiwan���s Polis was considered very cutting edge in 2015 because it was very new. But now, the government regularly uses the Join platform, which has Pd in it, so it���s a sign that Polis is no longer R&D ��� public servants feel comfortable using it. The state's role is to maintain the mature open source products and make sure it's part of the public civic infrastructure.Are you familiar with Nathan Schneider?I read his tweets.So he recently wrote a book about digital democracy, and has since begun researching what would happen if digital democracy was basically everywhere online. Like, if you had to vote on any number of decisions, wouldn���t that be a nightmare?You refer to ���Governable Spaces?���Exactly.We had some conversations, not with Nathan, but with people doing similar research. I think it all depends on how top down it is. For example, the Zero Summit (which is happening today and tomorrow) almost always uses Slido, the very thin way to crowdsource Q&As. But Slido was also acquired by Webex to be just one feature during the video chats. Democratic tech becomes a very thin layer like that.See also: 'We've Seen Breakder Discusses His New Book 'Governable Spaces'People being in the same Discord workspace is also this sort of governable space as part of their toolkit; they don't even need to think about it as digital democracy. But it actually increases the throughput of coordination and makes collaboration easier and in that setting. I don't think it's particularly dystopian, because it's literally just increasing the bandwidth and reducing latency of governance. We grow from that, like from four people to 400 people to 40,000 people and so on.I have a few slightly personal questions, you don't have to answer them. Are you an extropian?How would you define it? Like someone who wants to live indefinitely?Yeah, I guess so.Well, I have a very different relationship with longevity. I was born with a heart condition that for the first 12 years of my life, whenever I went to sleep it was a 50/50 chance that I would survive. I needed to get the surgery for the condition when I was 12. So I'm good now, but it shaped my personality. I always have this compulsion to publish before I perish every night. So I publish everything. So in a sense, I think it's also extropian.Do you think Taiwan should raise taxes?I mean, our taxes are so low by OECD standards. But we're doing pretty good with a very low tax rate. Last year, we even gave everyone $100, including young people, because we got more taxes than we anticipated from TSMC and so on.How long do you intend to stay in government office?So I'm stepping out on May 20.What are you doing next?I'm on a book tour. I'm going to go to Madrid and Paris for VivaTech. And I think to Croatia, for BlockSplit and also to Helsinki, Berlin ��� I'm missing a few. So many different countries in a span of three to four weeks right after May 20.Do you hold cryptocurrencies?I did, back in 2010-11 I consulted for one bitcoin per hour. But when I became a public servant I quite explicitly got out. My consultation rates when I started, bitcoin was something like 100 U.S. dollars and then it grew to $300 0 by this time I entered the cabinet in 2016. So it was still not very significant.Obviously, you are a strong advocate for open source everything. Do you think the same arguments hold true in the world of AI?Yeah, I mean, my mainframes started as computationally expensive. Open source still managed to thrive. But of course, during those times of the Free Software movement, open source started to thrive when personal computers started to get connected to the internet circa 1997. What I'm trying to get at is that I think the fundamental freedoms, like the freedom to use software for any purpose, is doubly true when it comes to machine learning and machine training models. If a foundation model cannot be governed by the people who use it, then essentially it's the people who train those foundation models, determining its worldview, perspectives and epistemic norms of the people using the model.So for example, in Taiwan, there is the National Science and Technology Council, which aligns the Lama3 models using local crowdsourced ��� what we call the alignment assembly, which is when people���s general preferences determine how it should behave ��� like with regards to the use of imaging celebrities in advertisements. It is a mini public microcosm of our population to determine the guide rails affected by it. The ability to steer AI is very important. And that openness to steering is the key whether you call it open source, or open weights or open access.Do you think the models will establish AGI?It only makes sense if you're like placing robots in place of people, because that's that's what AGI is ��� it can do what people can do. But in the actual way we're using AI nowadays, it���s more like assistive intelligence. The email replying modem doesn't send the email on my behalf, right? It just drafts emails on my behalf, using my style.All these uses increase our collective intelligence. And if the goal is plurality, then AGI is more like a distraction.Do you think Taiwan will remain a de years or century?Of course, of course. Depending on the ranking, we're either the most democratic country in all of Asia or the second: sometimes to Japan, sometimes to New Zealand. But we're certainly among the top and in terms of internet freedom. I think it is this combination that is very rare, because many jurisdictions think to allow for this amount of internet freedom, it will surely lead to polarization and decline of democracy. But Taiwan is living proof that you can have maximal internet and also a functional democracy without polarization.I really liked your phrase ���humor over rumor.��� When is it appropriate to apply a strategy like that?I think some sort of humor, at least on a personal level, is always good. When I look at very trollish, toxic text, I automatically focus on the like three words out of 3,000 that can be construed as funny or informative. Through this lens, we can enjoy interacting with the parts that's actually enjoyable.I often find that just making fun of oneselfrming. If you go to my Flickr, there's this whole album of me making memes like this, so whenever there���s some controversy at the ministry I can quickly respond with a mimetic picture as a very funny rebuttal. We call it pre-bunk. That is that you don't need to wait for information manipulation, polarization or conspiracy theories ��� you can make a funny scoreboard of people's preferences of AstraZeneca versus BNP versus Maderna if there���s controversy over the COVID vaccine.So you have a knack for a turn of phrase. Is there one expression that you choose to live by?Oh, yeah, I would like to be a good enough ancestor.Oh, that's a good one.I think good enough means that we don't over-design and foreclose the possibility of future generations. They're going to be much more creative, but it is our job to make sure that they have a larger canvas when they are born into the world compared to when I was born into the world.See also: Bitcoin Pioneer Hal Finney Posthumously Wins New Award Named enjamin Schiller."

It had risen 20% over the course of a week amid indications of pending approval and updated odds of the ETFs getting approved. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index that tracks the biggest tokens, fell 4.5% over 24 hours and the crypto market cap lost 2.9% to $2.5 trillion.���Ethereum's sell-off on positive news is a ty""buy the rumors, sell the facts"" reaction of speculators,��� Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email to CoinDesk. ���We shouldn't be surprised if the price pulls back to the $3000 area again, returning to an important consolidation area. From these levels, large institutional investors can start building a position in ETFs.���We saw the same in January after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, which took 19% off its price in the following two weeks before there was a spectacular reversal,��� he said.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday approved key regulatory filings tied to ether ETFs, a historic milestone for the second-largest cryptocurrency. They are not, however, cleared to trade. Although the SEC approved the 19B-4 form that allows for the offering and listing of ETFs, it must still green light the funds' S-1 filings before investors can buy them.The regulator approved documents for eight ETFs ��� from VanEck, Fidelity, Franklin, Grayscale, Bitwise, ARK y and BlackRock ��� for listing on the Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX exchanges.If the ETFs are approved for trading, a significant influx of institutional capital is likely.
