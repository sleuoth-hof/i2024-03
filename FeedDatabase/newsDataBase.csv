coindesk.com,The Untold Story Behind Beeple's Historic NFT Sale: 'Token Supremacy' Excerpt,https://www.coindesk.com//consensus-magazine/2024/05/24/the-untold-story-behind-beeples-historic-nft-sale-token-supremacy-excerpt/,2024-05-24 20:48,"Mike Winkelmann sank into the sofa as three cameras recorded his meltdown. The dueling identities that had once structured his life were coming into conflict as his fortunes increased by the second. Unseen crypto billionaires were bidding for his soul, or at least it felt that way. His entire artistic career was being auctioned as a compilation of five thousand digital artworks, packaged by the Christie���������s auctioneers as a single non-fungible token (NFT). The winner would receive this NFT as an online certificate of ownership, a deed to 14 years inside Winkelmann���������s mind. It was surreal watching his own coronation from the couch. The new crypto king was slack jawed as his net worth continued to rise by the millions on the computer screen, reckoning with the transformation of his art into an ultimate use-case for blockchain technology, bringing the metaverse into the mainstream. Two documentary crews captured his euphoric stupor, memorializing the tight choreogew York Times reporter writing about the art world's relationship to money, politics and technology, is the author of ""Token Supremacy: THE ART OF FINANCE, THE FINANCE OF ART, AND THE GREAT CRYPTO CRASH OF 2022,"" published by Penguin Random House.(Penguin Random House)The artist had become a multimillionaire at that moment. It was too much to bear, and suddenly he was bolting for the out door patio, away from the living room, where his family had gathered to celebrate his success. Winkelmann needed some air.Once upon a time, the promise of a divided life held some appeal. Mike owned a lucrative business turning digital graphics and animations into branded visuals for clients like Louis Vuitton, Apple and Justin Bieber. The money he earned from those productions allowed him to live in the McMansion suburbs outside of Charleston, South Carolina. He fit comfortably there into the patterns of home, work, and hobby. He was popular with the neighbors, a plucky midwestern transplant with a wide smile, a sailor���������s mouth, and a heart of gold. He would sometimes rant about politics, but otherwise focused on family, sitting pretty in a large home overlooking the palmetto trees. Mike understood the value, because his parents taught him midwestern manners and the importance of staying reserved in the middle-class Wisconsin village where he was born. So he kept his more libidinal thoughts inside a computer running so hot that it needed to be stored in the bathroom on a wood platform over the tub, near a jury-rigged industrial A/C unit that vented its heat into the attic.The computer expended its vast amounts of energy trying to contain Beeple, the internet crap monster responsible for Winkelmann���������s cult online following. He adopted the name in 2003, after a 1980s toy that looked like the abandoned love child of Sasquatch and Chewbacca, with light sensors that triggered its blinking nose and squeaky voice whenever its eyes were covered by a hand. Winkelmann had just graduated with a computer-science degree from Purdue University in Indiana, but he found programming ���������boring as sh*t.��������� The 22-year-old was more interested in shooting narrahe Beeple toy came to symbolize his fascination with the interplay of light and sound.In 2007, Beeple started a project that would eventually make him famous. The ""Everydays"" series began as a daily drawing habit of crude little doodles that seemed to betray his more corporate, Bill Gates appearance. The drawings were the crass products of a mind feeding on internet bile (racist caricatures, nude women, penis jokes, political satire) and tutored by magical realism (family portraits, animal studies, Jesus smoking cigarettes, Hillary Clinton wearing gold teeth). A year later, Beeple switched to Cinema4D, an animation software that allowed him to manipulate three-dimensional space. For the kid who spent hours at Toys ���������R��������� Us playing a demo of Super Mario������64 on the new Nintendo console, it was a dream come true to create realistic worlds on a computer. But it wasn���������t until around 2011 that he started fully utilizing the program to experiment with bright colors and blurry shapes with names like Synthetic Bubblegum Tittufux. Around the same time, Beeple started releasing music videos made with opular his creations had become only when, on a family vacation to Hong Kong, he saw one of his works projected outside a Hard Rock Cafe.A recognizable style finally emerged in 2017, when Beeple fully articulated his fascination with tech dystopias. Importing digital assets from other websites allowed him to createmore detailed scenes in only a couple hours. His imagination exploded with skyscrapers stacked atop cargo containers, Santa Claus clones brawling to the death, and cultists worshipping an original Macintosh computer. Celebrity sightings abound in these nihilistic tales of the future: Donald Trump���������s head opens to reveal a burger brain; Mickey Mouse holds a machine gun; and Buzz Lightyear lactates in the park.See also: Beeple Sold Out. So What?All that chaos was contained in Winkelmann���������s computer, sitting on a desk with its cables running into the bathroom hotbox. His home office was largely undecorated, with beige carpeting, Walmart bookshelves, andand Fox News on mute throughout the day. He was neither the first artist to adopt lowbrow culture (Marcel Duchamp beat him there by nearly a century when he exhibited a signed urinal in 1917) nor the first to immerse himself in mass media (Andy Warhol and his silkscreens of Marilyn Monroe might like a word). What made Beeple special was his evangelism for digital art, his embodiment of the internet���������s tendency toward dark absurdism, and his eagerness to build an economy around it. He had already cultivated a network of nearly two million followers on Instagram, and artist friends were repeatedly bugging him to start releasing NFTs. Why not try something new?Beeple had everything to gain and nothing to lose. In late October 2020, days before the presidential election, he released three artworks on the NFT marketplace Nifty Gatewa""Politics Is Bullshit,"" featuring a diarrheic bull tattooed with an American flag with a Twitter bird perched upon its neck. The initial offer for this edition of 100 images was just $1.00 each.���������If you need extra convincing from some BS artist���������s notes wether you want to spend a dollar on this i will punch you in the god damn face,��������� Beeple wrote about the offering in the lowercase, typo-ridden idiom of internetspeak. ���������Smash the buy button ya jabroni.���������Poof. All gone. Sold. The two other NFTs offered, including one from a video series called Crossroads, went for $66,666.66 each. Even with such a devilish price ��������� decided upon with the whimsy of a speculative market willing to spend whatever ��������� Winkelmann could identify his salvation in the metaverse. The most he had ever made from his artworks was $100 for a small print. Now the artist saw a potential avenue with the release of CryptoKitty and CryptoPunk NFTs. Executives behind those products had predicted that digital art would find online buyers, and within the two-month period from November to January 2018, CryptoKitties made $52 million. Mack Flavelle, a founder of the CryptoKitties project, pointed out why: ���������There���������s not that much that people can do with cryptocurrency,��������� he told the New York Times reporter Scott Reyburn at the time. ���������We gave them something fun and useful to do with their Ethereum.���������Winkelmann���������s success seemed to fulfill the prophecy that individual artists would benefit from the cryptoeconomy. But the business developers behind crypto companies were looking for the kind of legitimization that no amount of advertising could attain, and collectibles by themselves felt like little more than a bubble. They wanted the approval of legacy compani of postwar and contemporary art. The anachronism was supposed to convey the immediacy of the artwork���������s appeal, even if art historians were more skeptical about its authenticity; nevertheless, the auction house described Salvator Mundi as a genuine Leonardo da Vinci painting, and it sold for a record $450.3 million to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. The price overtook the previous benchmark, set by a Picasso painting in 2015, by almost triple. Gasps from the salesroom confirmed the event as peak spectacle, made even more ridiculous in the coming years, as Salvator Mundi remained locked inside the crown prince���������s yacht; he refused to exhibit the painting publicly, allegedly because he feared that museums might downgrade the work as belonging to a Leonardo assistant instead of the master himself.Restructuring continued in 2020, as Christie���������s announced that it would merge its impressionist and modern and contemporary art departm,��������� Guillaume Cerutti, chief executive at the auction house, told reporters at the time.The decision came at a time when impressionist and modern sales were performing far below their postwar and contemporary competitors. Combining the departments would dump collectors into one pool, changing the dynamics of the market and pushing tastes toward the present. It suddenly seemed that the most expensive artworks had paint dripping off the canvas; the artists were oftentimes women and people of color, and they were in their 30s and 40s ��������� shocking for an industry that had exclusively prized dead white men for the majority of its existence. Sales of art sold within three years of its creation date grew 1,000% over the past decade to almost $260 million.Ironically, the arrival of the ultra-contemporary market occurred around the same time that ""20th Century Evening Sale"" in October 2020 would be the remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex, nicknamed Stan, which ended up selling for $31.8 million, the most ever paid for a fossil at the time.Many employees were bitter about the changes; they rolled their eyes at the little anachronisms that had become headliners. It was a successful marketing gimmick by the bigwigs to grab attention in a moment when the pandemic economy seemed on the verge of daily collapse. Those who joined the auction house to nerd out on art history hated this new approach, but others, with a sense for business, thrived in the controlled chaos.See also: Robert Alice Made NFT History, Now He's Writing About It���������I have always felt like I am living in the theater of the absurd,��������� Davis later confided in me. He relished the ridiculous nature of his industry. The auction world was a system of meaningless sales records, an illusion of competition that often boiled down to a handful of rich men who all knew one another compnoisseurship was dead. Provenance was a mirage. Dinosaur bones were being sold next to Rothko and Picasso paintings.���������All I know is that I know nothing,��������� Davis said, adding that the motto was actually a paraphrase of something Socrates once said and a lyric from a song called ���������Knowledge��������� by the California punk band Operation Ivy.So, when the salesman considered all the strange circumstances surrounding him, auctioning an NFT sounded perfectly reasonable. ���������It will be fun and a little weird,��������� he predicted. The auction was less than two months away, and everyone supporting the NFT sale had something to prove. Meghan Doyle, a researcher, and Ryoma Ito, the chief marketing officer, started working around the clock, feeling pressure to create the ""Everydays"" to commemorate 14 years of working on the project.���������Cool, but maybe not as epic as it should be,��������� Doyle said, declining the proposal.Winkelmann returned with a new idea. ���������I had hit this perfect milestone in this massive project,��������� he remembered. ���������And I had just happened to hit 5,000 days of making art.��������� Instead of offeri""EVERYDAYS,"" a collage of all his work up to that date. (Christie's)���������He came back to us with a magnum opus,��������� Doyle said. ���������With that image in hand, we were able to rally the support that we needed to develop content around the piece and get advertisements in the newspaper. We had a complete story, a complete picture.���������However, Ito found the level of involvement from Christie���������s marketing department lacking. Understanding the stakes of this auction for his company, he started trying to make his own luck through outreach with private collectors ��������� ���������whales,��������� as they are called in the crypto community. Vignesh Sundaresan was one of the first names on his list.In January, Sundaresan could be found on the virtual disco floor with a champagne glass floating about the head of his digital avatar. He was partying hard in the metave was operating under a mysterious persona named MetaKovan, which translates from his native Tamil language into ���������King of Meta.���������Sundaresan was a serial entrepreneur in the crypto industry; he had gained his affinity for decentralized finance after a childhood in the Indian city of Chennai, where he dreamed of becoming the next Steve Jobs. He was born there in 1988, and came of age alongside the World Wide Web, which had been released the following year. Then there were a series of false starts, including the creation of ���������Bitcoin ATMs,��������� which enabled users to deposit physical cash and receive crypto, and a trading platform called Lendroid, which blew through its $48 million in funding within two years.In 2019, Sundaresan started investing heavily in digital properties, buying a digital representation of a diamond-studded Formula One car for an online racing game, NFT artworks and hundreds of acres in the digs his ���������exosuit��������� created for ���������building the metaverse.���������At the virtual party in January, Sundaresan, now 33, unveiled a fund called Metapurse for investing in NFTs. The 20 Beeple artworks that he had purchased were bundled into a single asset called B.20, which was then fractionalized into ten million tokens. Buyers of the tokens were told that this would denote ownership over the metaverse���������s first large-scale public art project.���������We were inspired by the idea of not only being able to own historic artwork, like the Mona Lisa, but also being able to own the museum it was displayed in, and then sharing that ownership and experience with the public,��������� the company said in its newsletter. ���������Making money with art is fairly simple and not very imaginative. What we want to do is to decentralize and democratize art.�gtant, MetaKovan wanted to leverage NFTs as a financial instrument. He was exactly the kind of person who might want to send a message about the power of digital art by spending millions on an image.Gradually, Sundaresan was coaxed into the process. He had some initial worries about going through the Christie���������s ���������know your customer��������� process, an anti-money-laundering rule that ensures that companies keep records on the essential facts of their buyers and sellers. He expressed his reservations to Ito, fearing that he would be unmasked as MetaKovan because of the digital identity trail. But, eventually, he came to accept that this was a risk involved in doing business with an established auction house, even if the majority of bidders remain anonymous to the public unless they choose to reveal themselves. He was joined by his cofounder at Metapurse ��������� another Indian crypto investor, Anand Venkateswaran ����gstie���������s, which had initially been slow to support the sale, finally kicked into action. Winkelmann���������s NFT idea had been rebranded into an event wi""Everydays: The First 5000 Days."" Doyle was receiving increasing numbers of emails from crypto collectors expressing their interest in placing a bid. The artwork had been published without a price range; instead, the auction house chose to write ���������estimate unknown,��������� a cheeky nod to the usual ���������inquire for estimate��������� phrase implying that anyone needing to ask was too poor to buy.���������Estimate unknown.��������� That was the truth. Winkelmann had prepared himself for the NFT to sell for somewhere near $1 million. Ito had the same gut feeling. It wasn���������t until a few days before the sale, as reporters started asking if they were prepared to sell for tens of millions, that the team realized something profound was about to happen.���������Noah looked at me and said, ���������We are about to throw a grenade on the art world,���������ium fee be paid in dollars; however, sale organizers worried that such an arrangement would discourage crypto whales from participating in the auction.Success needed to be measured with the company���������s longterm goals for growth. Accepting cryptocurrency would invite scrutiny from the press, traditional collectors and government regulators; it could also be a financial risk, depending on the volatile prices of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). What ultimately became clear to decision makers was that nothing about this sale could be half-assed. Big money often requires big leaps of faith.���������A decision was made at the highest levels to take the whole thing in cryptocurrency,��������� Doyle said. ���������The amount of cogs in the wheel for that to happen was truly mind-blowing.���������The gamble worked, and the tidal waves of inquiries about the Beeple sale never stopped. Sundaresan had already confirmed his partius online bidding wars that the auction house had ever seen.On February 25, 2021, the auction began with a $100 opening bid. Within eight minutes, the price had reached $1 million.���������I was shocked that our website could handle it,��������� Doyle said. ���������I had never seen that happen.���������The auction had already reached the threshold for bidders at which the prospective buyers needed to be cleared financially, often with letters of references from the crypto exchanges supporting their transactions. There were nearly two dozen hopeful buyers at that point, 18 of whom were entirely new to Christie���������s. Most were millennials.See also: What's Next for Beeple After Dizzying $69M NFT Sale?���������It was a psychotic amount of bidding,��������� Davis thought as his phone started blowing up with messages.

coindesk.com,Audrey Tang: Learning From Taiwan���������s Digit,https://www.coindesk.com//consensus-magazine/2024/05/22/audrey-tang-learning-from-taiwans-digital-civic-experimentation/,2024-05-22 21:19,"A new political philosophy has entered the chat.���������Plurality,��������� the title and central subject of a new book by Microsoft���������s internal economist Glen Weyl and Taiwan���������s former (as of yesterday) Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang, is the idea that collaboration-enhancing technologies should be more widely embraced both by the public and state. Societies should learn to cherish a wider range of viewpoints, the authors argue, and one of the ways to foster that state of mind is through technologies ��������� perhaps blockchains ��������� that enable us to come together.The book is essentially a coda to Tang���������s career as a public servant as well as an outgrowth of Weyl���������s previous techno-political theory meant to counter the malaise overtaking a world beset by wealth inequality and economic stagnation, laid out in �����tour to speak about the theory of Plurality and educate politicians on Taiwan���������s groundbreaking civic digital experiments.You may be asking yourself how it is that advocating for a diversity of opinions, healthy civic debate and technology is a novel political strategy. And you���������d be right! But what sets Plurality apart is Tang���������s tangible experience running large scale, open-source, public, digital infrastructure projects like the g0v project (pronounced Gov Zero), which created open source and interactive alternatives of Taiwan���������s government websites, and vTaiwan, which enabled citizens to petition for policies.In other words, there is praxis to Tang and Weyl���������s theory ��������� a goal in action. Weyl has described Plurality as something similar to environmentalism; it only works if you do it. The dream is to get the whole world on-boarded onto this system, advancingith a number of co-authors, the book is freely available to all (here) and something they hope to add to over time.See also: Changemaker: Glen Weyl Puts His Radical Ideas Into Action���������Our project will be carried out in conjunction with Plurality research and implementation,��������� Tang and Weyl write in an announcement post. ���������We don't just need hackers and writers, we need designers, storytellers, marketers and distributors to work with us. Under no circumstances will Glen and Audrey receive any compensation or royalties for writing this book, in keeping with the legal code that accompanies their positions; revenue will only be used to support the community and philanthropic mission we hope to build.���������CoinDesk caught up with Tang (who by all accounts has had a fascinating life, which was detailed yesterday in a TIME profile and will soon be the subject of a documentary) to discuss the writing of the book, how to cocestor.���������This interview has been edited for length and clarity.To start off with an easy one: What was it like writing a book with Glen Weyl?So the book actually started two years ago even before I was appointed as minister of digital affairs. So in a sense, it grew with the ministry. As you understand, our ministry got started when the unprovoked war on Kyiv happened, when people suddenly started to care about resilience. And so a lot of the ideas from the book, like IPFS, decentralization and Web3 for redundancy, suddenly became a topic of focus when our ministry first started a year and a half ago.I think it's both very practical that those cutting edge ideas get used in Taiwan, and also highly enjoyable in the sense that people care about Taiwan. But they may not know how a civic tech ecosystem functions or how the state can fund a lot of decentralized technology as public infrastructure in the same way it builds highways and bridges.There was a lot of mutual learning. I would alssult of co-writing this book, both Vitalik Buterin and Glen have become residents of Taiwan. They got gold cards, which we hand out for anyone who contributes for 8 years or more to open source or any of the internet commons.For people who would hear the gist of the book and assume that it's another form of technical libertarianism, could you describe exactly what you mean by ���������plurality?���������Sure, so plurality means collaborative diversity, right? It means technology that fosters diversity. So in that sense, it is a little bit similar to the idea of decentralization where everybody can host their own systems. But there's another dimension of effective collaboration and coordination, which we loosely refer to as democracy but it's not about just voting. It is about a continuous form of democracy that allows, for example, AI facilitated deliberation between people holding very conflicting ideas to build bridges for people who were originally ideologically opposed.Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative ActionI would say this form of collaboration sounds a little bit technocratic, that diversity sounds a little bit libertarian, but it is a unique combination of the two ��������� collaborative diversity ��������� that sets plurality apart.So I liked the book. It was a love letter to Taiwan in some sense, but how would you best persuade governments outside of Taiwan to adopt these democratic experimentations?Well, first of all, I think we learn from a lot of other governments as well. Our reputation system came from Reykjavik, Iceland. Our participatory budget system came from Barcelona. And of course, we were inspired by the internet consultation in Brazil from more than 10 years ago. And so there's a long tradition of working with internet technologies, not for the government to govern the internet, but using internet technologies to improve the governance of government itself.What Taiwan can contribute here is tha, resilient defenses against polarization attacks, you know, information manipulation attacks, deep fakes, transnational fraud and pandemic misinformation ��������� you name it. For example, we've managed to overcome the polarization tied to our January election, without people hating each other.That's partly thanks to participatory fact checking, where we set up a community with 1000s of contributors and music to spread the idea of super fact checking. So as you can see, in any jurisdiction where there are similar threats or a similar urgency for clarity, these ideas take hold and the grassroots community just grows from there.Just off of the idea of crowdsourcing truth. X has a version of it. Do you think these different programs are better run by the government or by private corporations?Yeah, I think that the greatest thing about Community Notes is that it really is open source. I remember Vitalik set up his own node to verify what x.com did was correct. So because it's open source, you er. Imagine, not just for x.com, but for anybody in the fedi-verse where you can conceivably you can build a Community Notes, including Threads and other things, and in a sense making this not just a jury duty of sorts, but rather making it a alternate entry point where the Committee Notes are the default for the various different social platforms.So to your question, I see it working as a bridging system across different social networks and that the state should fund it, of course, but not control it. This is in a sense like funding running water for civil discourse, because if there is no such layer, then polarization is the default for the current generation of the social web.Responding to some of the like blockchain critics, how can the blockchain world help devise protocols that look more plural pluralistic rather than plutocratic?I think a healthy ecosystem in the blockchain world is one that is not dominated by a single implementation, right? So of course Ethereum itself has multiple implementations and also on different layer 2 solutions. I have in mind, for example, the Polkadot system, which is a distinct ecosystem, building on a kind of common meta-protocol. We need to get people to better understand that crypto really follows a toolkit approach, like the fact that you can reuse most of the governance protocols and enjoy cross-chain coordination. I think this is something that we in traditional politics find it difficult to imagine.Of course, there are things like gold cards that give people residency across multiple jurisdictions that kind of approximate this, but it is still not as nimble or mobile as, for example, Gitcoin is as far as that can identify people across multiple social presences. These examples serve as a very important proof of concept. So that when new governments start looking at quadratic voting, project funding and all sorts of ways coordination could be more thorough, they can point to those already working on-chain examples and say, ���������oh, let's just copy  research from scratch.So the Daily Beast wrote a piece saying that some of Taiwan's civil tech experimentations are seeing decreasing use.Yeah, they decreased during the pandemic. That is true.I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond because I don���������t think I saw a quote from you.I think it's up to the vTaiwan community to explain what happened during the pandemic and what happened after. If you want a quote, actually, because the Plurality book is co-written with them, you can just read their accountChapter 2-2, has a very comprehensive response, saying that, and I quote, ���������As a decentralized, citizen-led community, vTaiwan is also a living organism that naturally evolves and adapts as citizen volunteers participate in various ways. The community���������s engagement experienced a downturn following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted face-to-face meetings and led to decreased participation. The platform faced challenndates for governmental responses, and its somewhat narrow focus. In response to these challenges, vTaiwan���������s community has sought to find a new role between the public and the government and extend its outreach beyond the realm of Taiwanese regulation in recent years. A significant effort to revitalize vTaiwan was its collaboration with OpenAI���������s Democratic Input to AI project in 2023. Through partnerships with Chatham House and the organization of several physical and online deliberative events centered on the topic of AI ethics and localization, vTaiwan successfully integrated local perspectives into the global discourse on AI and technology governance.���������Then the next paragraphs say that today a second, related platform, Join, averages about more than 11,000 unique daily visitors. So while the state e-petition platform enjoyed slightly increasing participation during the pandemic because of the ease of online voting, vTaiwan��enow they're on a bounce back.So in a sense, you���������re saying there was a natural evolution of people moving to different platforms, like the shift from MySpace to Facebook?I think the good thing about g0v [pronounced Gov-Zero] is that every project is by definition open source and part of Creative Commons. And so for new generations who want to revitalize vTaiwan, they do not have to start from scratch.See also: Ethereum's New Radical: Glen Weyl Isn't Vitalik But He's Its Next Best HopeOf course, the vTaiwan community today is not the same community at launch in 2014. All of us who were part of the original thing are still around, but the people who are running it are like 10 years younger than us now. And so, to your question, I think it is not just a migration thing. It is also how each generation thinks about experimentation. The original use of vTaiwan���������s Polis was considered very cutting edge in 2015 because it was very new. But now, the government regularlyd in it, so it���������s a sign that Polis is no longer R&D ��������� public servants feel comfortable using it. The state's role is to maintain the mature open source products and make sure it's part of the public civic infrastructure.Are you familiar with Nathan Schneider?I read his tweets.So he recently wrote a book about digital democracy, and has since begun researching what would happen if digital democracy was basically everywhere online. Like, if you had to vote on any number of decisions, wouldn���������t that be a nightmare?You refer to ���������Governable Spaces?���������Exactly.We had some conversations, not with Nathan, but with people doing similar research. I think it all depends on how top down it is. For example, the Zero Summit (which is happening today and tomorrow) almost always uses Slido, the very thin way to crowdsource Q&As. But Slido was also acquired by Webex to be just one feature during the vider Discusses His New Book 'Governable Spaces'People being in the same Discord workspace is also this sort of governable space as part of their toolkit; they don't even need to think about it as digital democracy. But it actually increases the throughput of coordination and makes collaboration easier and in that setting. I don't think it's particularly dystopian, because it's literally just increasing the bandwidth and reducing latency of governance. We grow from that, like from four people to 400 people to 40,000 people and so on.I have a few slightly personal questions, you don't have to answer them. Are you an extropian?How would you define it? Like someone who wants to live indefinitely?Yeah, I guess so.Well, I have a very different relationship with longevity. I was born with a heart condition that for the first 12 years of my life, whenever I went to sleep it was a 50/50 chance that I would survive. I needed to get the surgery for the condition when I was 12. So I'm good now, but it shaped my personality. I always have this compulsion to publish before I perish every night. So I publish everything. So in a sense, I think it's also extropian.Do you think Taiwan should raise taxes?I mean, our taxes are so low by OECD standards. But we're doing pretty good with a very low tax rate. Last year, we even gave everyone $100, including young people, because we got more taxes than we anticipated from TSMC and so on.How long do you intend to stay in government office?So I'm stepping out on May 20.What are you doing next?I'm on a book tour. I'm going to go to Madrid and Paris for VivaTech. And I think to Croatia, for BlockSplit and also to Helsinki, Berlin ��������� I'm missing a few. So many different countries in a span of three to four weeks right after May 20.Do you hold cryptocurrencies?I did, back in 2010-11 I consulted for one bitcoin per hour. But when I became a public servant I quite explicitly got out. My consultation rates when I started, bitcoin was something like 100 U.S. dollars and the0 by this time I entered the cabinet in 2016. So it was still not very significant.Obviously, you are a strong advocate for open source everything. Do you think the same arguments hold true in the world of AI?Yeah, I mean, my mainframes started as computationally expensive. Open source still managed to thrive. But of course, during those times of the Free Software movement, open source started to thrive when personal computers started to get connected to the internet circa 1997. What I'm trying to get at is that I think the fundamental freedoms, like the freedom to use software for any purpose, is doubly true when it comes to machine learning and machine training models. If a foundation model cannot be governed by the people who use it, then essentially it's the people who train those foundation models, determining its worldview, perspectives and epistemic norms of the people using the model.So for example, in Taiwan, there is the National Science and Technology Council, which aligns the Lama3 models using local crowdsourced ��������� what we call the alignment assembly, which is when people���������s general preferences determine how it should behave ��������� like with regards to the use of imaging celebrities in advertisements. It is a mini public microcosm of our population to determine the guide rails affected by it. The ability to steer AI is very important. And that openness to steering is the key whether you call it open source, or open weights or open access.Do you think the models will establish AGI?It only makes sense if you're like placing robots in place of people, because that's that's what AGI is ��������� it can do what people can do. But in the actual way we're using AI nowadays, it���������s more like assistive intelligence. The email replying modem doesn't send the email on my behalf, right? It just drafts emails on my behalf, using my style.All these uses increase our collective intelligence. And if the g years or century?Of course, of course. Depending on the ranking, we're either the most democratic country in all of Asia or the second: sometimes to Japan, sometimes to New Zealand. But we're certainly among the top and in terms of internet freedom. I think it is this combination that is very rare, because many jurisdictions think to allow for this amount of internet freedom, it will surely lead to polarization and decline of democracy. But Taiwan is living proof that you can have maximal internet and also a functional democracy without polarization.I really liked your phrase ���������humor over rumor.��������� When is it appropriate to apply a strategy like that?I think some sort of humor, at least on a personal level, is always good. When I look at very trollish, toxic text, I automatically focus on the like three words out of 3,000 that can be construed as funny or informative. Through this lens, we can enjoy interacting with the parts that's actually enjoyable.I often rming. If you go to my Flickr, there's this whole album of me making memes like this, so whenever there���������s some controversy at the ministry I can quickly respond with a mimetic picture as a very funny rebuttal. We call it pre-bunk. That is that you don't need to wait for information manipulation, polarization or conspiracy theories ��������� you can make a funny scoreboard of people's preferences of AstraZeneca versus BNP versus Maderna if there���������s controversy over the COVID vaccine.So you have a knack for a turn of phrase. Is there one expression that you choose to live by?Oh, yeah, I would like to be a good enough ancestor.Oh, that's a good one.I think good enough means that we don't over-design and foreclose the possibility of future generations. They're going to be much more creative, but it is our job to make sure that they have a larger canvas when they are born into the world compared to when I was born into the world.See also: Bitcoinenjamin Schiller."

Leeds Rhinos and Great Britain rugby league great Rob Burrow has died.. Burrow, who was 41, had lived with motor neurone disease (MND) since being diagnosed in late 2019.. The diagnosis came just two years after he retired from playing, following a stellar 17-year career that included winning eight Super League Grand Finals, three World Club Challenges and two Challenge Cups.. Burrow's death was announced by the Rhinos, who called their former scrum-half and hooker ""a true inspiration throughout his life whether that was on the rugby league field or during his battle with MND"".. The Prince of Wales said Burrow would be remembered as a ""legend"" with ""a huge heart"".. In 2022, Burrow was presented with the Helen Rollason Award at the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year ceremony, with his ex-Leeds team-mate Kevin Sinfield also recognised.. Burrow was given the award for relentless fundraising and raising awareness of MND while battling the illness himself.. Burrow spent his entire club career with Leeds and made more than 400 appearances between 2001 and 2017.. This video can not be played. Burrow honoured with Helen Rollason Award while Sinfield accepts special award. One of the most successful rugby league players in history, Burrow was made an MBE in the 2021 New Year Honours for his services to the sport and for his work in the MND community.. Burrow and his great friend Sinfield were both made CBEs in the 2024 New Year Honours. The pair have helped to raise more than ��15m for MND charities since Burrow's diagnosis.. Burrow struck a defiant tone on learning he had MN""The worst thing for me is people pitying me,"" he said. ""I know it's going to come, but I want to be as normal as ever.. ""While I am able-bodied and feel fit and strong and healthy, I want to do normal things and not be treated any differently."". Burrow and wife Lindsey, who married in 2006, had children Jackson, Maya and Macy together.. In announcing his death on Sunday, Leeds said of Burrow: ""He never allowed others to define what he could achieve and believed in his own ability to do more.. ""The outpouring of love and support that Rob and the whole Burrow family have received over the last four and a half years meant so much to Rob.. ""In particular, the rugby league family and MND community have rallied around Rob to inspire him, thank you for your support.. ""For those who knew Rob throughout his life, his determination and spirit in the face of MND over the last four and a half years came as no surprise.. ""Rob never accepted that he couldn't do something. He just found his way of doing it better than anyone else.. ""He will continue to inspire us all every day. In a world full of adversity. We must dare to dream."". Burrow a sporting great and inspirational MND campaigner. 'Beacon of hope' - Sinfield's tribute to friend Burrow. Tributes paid to Rob Burrow following death at 41.

In February, it was announced that the player of the match award at this year's Super League Grand Final will be renamed after Burrow, the first player to win the trophy twice, in 2007 and 2011.. Tributes flooded in from the rugby league world, with Super League leaders St Helens calling Burrow ""a hero in every sense of the word"" and Wigan Warriors saying that ""his legacy will live on through those whose lives he touched, and his story will continue to inspire all"".. A tribute to Burrow from the Rugby Football League said: ""Since December 2019, his courage and humanity - allied to that of his family, friends and former Leeds Rhinos team-mates, led by Kevin Sinfield CBE - has transcended sport."". The Prince of Wales, who presented the CBE to Burrow and Sinfield at Headingley in a January visit this year, paid tribute on X.. The prince wrote: ""A legend of Rugby League, Rob Burrow had a huge heart. He taught us, 'in a world full of adversity, we must dare to dream.' Catherine and I send our love to Lindsey, Jackson, Maya and Macy."". The MND Association, for whom Burrow became a patron in 2021, said it was ""incredibly grateful to Rob and his family for helping to raise awareness of MND, and funds for the association, by sharing the details of their journey and by inspiring so many people both within the MND community and the wider public"".. ""In doing so much, he inspired support from so many,"" the charity added.. ""It is testament to the strength of feeling people have for Rob that the support in his name has never wavered."".

Burrow, his family and his long-term friend Sinfield used various means to tell their story and help raise awareness of Burrow���s condition.. In 2022, they contributed to a BBC documentary called Rob Burrow: Living with MND, about love, family, friendships and the reality of living with the condition.. Former team-mate Sinfield, who Burrow met when he was 12, has completed several endurance challenges which have raised a total of more than ��7m and been featured in two BBC documentaries.. Burrow began using an eye-controlled computer which put words into a version of his voice to allow him to communicate. Using that machine, he read the CBeebies Bedtime Story on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in 2022.. He also put questions to other sporting legends for an award-winning BBC podcast in 2023 called 'Rob Burrow Seven, Meets...', featuring the likes of Wayne Rooney, Jonny Wilkinson and Mike andall.. Earlier this year, Burrow and Sinfield contributed to a picture book which told the story of a friendship between two young boys named Rob and Kev, and Burrow's widow Lindsey has already written a memoir which is due to be published in 2025.. Burrow's wife Lindsey was a constant support throughout his fundraising. Matt Newsum, BBC rugby league correspondent. For such a diminutive figure, the loss of Rob Burrow casts a big shadow over rugby league - a sport he loved, conquered and championed throughout his life.. From a kid in ill-fitting padding to his highest peaks as a decorated member of the Leeds Rhinos 'golden generation', Rob defied both standard thinking and adversity to become a world-class player.. What was to some a disadvantage - his small stature - he turned into a positive. His tackle technique made him an axe-like cutter in defence, while his speed off the mark and devastating footwork left the big boys pawing at thin air as he left them in his wake. Think a sporting 'Roadrunner' and you're on the right track.. He was also brave as a player - another factor that helped him deal with his later diagnosis - and the sight of him standing up to Hull's huge forward Epalahame Lauaki remains an image many fans will recall fondly.. Burrow achieved all the success and all the glory without changing his personality. I can recall times waiting around in the bowels of Headingley after a rare Leeds loss; he would never refuse the interview, however glum the expression.. He was selfless as a player and this continued in his coaching role as he helped mould the Rhinos stars of tomorrow before his MND diagnosis forced him to step aside.. The wider public came to know what rugby league fans already knew as he challenged his disease with his defiance, shining a beacon on the condition and capturing hearts and minds with his character and spirit.. Rob Burrow was no ordinary rugby league player and certainly no ordinary human being. He was the best of both..

bbc.com,"AI fakes, abuse and misinformation pushed to young voters on TikTok",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ww6vz1l81o,2024-06-02 21:12,"Young voters in key election battlegrounds are being recommended fake AI-generated videos featuring party leaders, misinformation, and clips littered with abusive comments, the BBC has found.. With TikTok emerging as a new social media battleground in this election, the political parties have begun a war of memes on the app in a bid to reach its audience of young voters.. But a BBC project to investigate the content promoted by social media algorithms has found - alongside funny montages - young people on TikTok are being exposed to misleading and divisive content. It is being shared by everyone from students and political activists to comedians and anonymous bot-like accounts.. Videos which have racked up hundreds of thousands of views have promoted unfounded rumours that a major scandal prompted Rishi Sunak to call an early election and the baseless claim that Sir Keir Starmer was responsible for the failure to prosecute serial paedophile Jimmy Savile.. Satirical, fake AI-generated clips show Rishi Sunak declaring, ���Please don���t vote us out, we would be proper gutted!��� and making unevidenced claims about how the Conservative leader is spending public money - including how he will send his ���mates loads of dosh���.. Other AI-generated videos share misleading claims about his national service pledge for 18-year-olds, suggesting young people would be sent to current war zones in Ukraine and Gaza.. Some of these are described as satire or parody in captions, but the comments suggest some users are confused about which claims are factual.. TikTok told the BBC it had increased its investment in countering misinformation for the UK general election, including adding a fact-checking expert to existing resources and employing AI-labelling technology.. The videos were spotted as part of the BBC's Undercover Voters project, which has created profiles for 24 fictional people on all the major social media sites, based on data and analysis by the National Centre for Social Research (Natcepresent a range of voters in battleground constituencies across the UK, giving an insight into what content is promoted to different types of people. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch content relevant to their character traits informed by the Natcen research.. I examined the feeds of the profiles of three of these fictional voters in the former ���red wall��� constituency of Bishop Auckland, a target for Labour which is currently held by the Conservatives - and where our Undercover Voters are younger.. Their social media feeds revealed that, while other sites have also experienced a flurry of political content, TikTok had the most lively conversation, particularly among younger voters.. TikTok has boomed since the last election. According to media regulator Ofcom, it was the fastest-growing source of news in the UK for the second year in a row in 2023 - used by 10% of adults in this way. One in 10 teenagers say it is their most important news source.. TikTng a new generation in the democratic process. Whether you use the social media app or not, what is unfolding on its site could shape narratives about the election and its candidates - including in ways that may be unfounded.. Content promoted to Undercover Voter character Jack, a disaffected 31-year-old, include TikToks misrepresenting remarks made by Labour politicians in speech bubbles. These include comments about immigration, transgender rights, Brexit - and false claims that the shadow international development secretary called to ���abolish the Army���.. Several other videos repeated the unfounded allegations about Sir Keir and Jimmy Savile.. Other videos Jack was served on his feed included clips with threats in the comments about ���euthanizing��� Rishi Sunak and racist remarks about him.. Messages such as ���vote Reform UK��� were shared repeatedly in the comments of many videos, much more than those I saw in support of any other party. TikTok users have begun to ng the posters ���Reform bots���, suggesting they could be fake, automated accounts.. I contacted some of the commenters who had photos and names on their profiles, and they told me they were real people based in the UK with no official affiliation to Reform UK and with no encouragement or instruction from the party. But others were anonymous with no profile image and numerical usernames - common hallmarks of fake accounts - and they did not respond to my messages.. Whether they are real people or not, their comments can create the impression that their preferred party has greater support.. Another Undercover Voter character based in Bishop Auckland, 25-year-old Chloe, was created to have no prior interest in politics. But about one in 10 posts on her TikTok feed was a political meme or funny video, including official content coming from the Labour Party, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Reform UK.. These include Rishi Sunak���s first TikTok on the Conservatives��� new account abouifying that he is not forcing all 18-year-olds to join the army. . They also include a video of Cilla Black singing Surprise Surprise from the official Labour profile - with a caption saying ���POV: Rishi Sunak turning up on your 18th birthday to send you to war���.. A third Undercover Voter named Louise - in her 50s and politically undecided - was pushed more TikToks targeting political leaders with abusive comments, as well as satirical montages and parody videos about policy announcements such as national service.. I tracked down some of the people behind the videos and posts shown to our Undercover Voters.. One 16-year-old from the south of England, who made a satirical edit of that first Rishi Sunak TikTok about national service, said she was surprised how quickly her content took off.. ���I didn���t specifically create this account for the election and the reason I made the TikTok initially was just for a joke - I didn���t expect to get over 400k bloody views,��� she ted with any party and has not received any money for creating the TikTok.. ���Social media really is the only platform for young people to have a voice nowadays in my opinion.���. She said she knows satirical content can be ���controversial��� and she understands how her video ���could mislead people��� but would hope people could tell it was supposed to be a bit of fun.. Alongside the video, some users had posted threatening comments towards Mr Sunak, but the 16-year-old said she did not think anyone would actually want to harm a politician.. Dozens of other users I messaged who are creating this content are also in their late teens or early 20s, and want to get involved in creating political videos to engage other people their age in the election. . They all tell me that while they may support a political party, they have not been paid for their posts and are not officially affiliated with any of the campaigns.. One politics student tells me they ���don���t w mislead others with their opinions about other parties���.. Another person based in Coventry, who shares his videos about Reform UK, tells me he hopes to ���boost their popularity in an unofficial way��� and says he set up his account back in February. He say he is a member of the party and has not received any money for making his TikToks.. He is concerned that satirical content - including his own - might unintentionally mislead people on TikTok. His account was restricted by TikTok for posting spam.. A spokesperson for TikTok told the BBC that it had increased its investment ���in efforts to ensure reliable information can be found on TikTok���, launching a ���UK Election Centre with a fact-checking expert��� and adopting an ���industry-leading AI labelling technology���.. It also said it was introducing ���more policies to aggressively counter foreign election interference��� and that it removed 97% of videos with misinformation about elecd out more about the Undercover Voters project on Sunday's episode of Newscast here.

After days of speculation, the veteran left-winger said she was the ""adopted Labour candidate"" in Hackney North and Stoke Newington.. A bitter row over whether the party would select her as its candidate in the seat has dominated the first week of campaigning.. Ms Abbott also denied reports she was among a number of Labour MPs who had been offered peerages in return for standing aside.. Writing on X, she said: ""I have never been offered a seat in the Lords, and would not accept one if offered"".. ""I intend to run and to win as Labour's candidate,"" she added. The party is yet to comment.. It comes after Baroness Chakrabarti, a close ally, urged her to ""take some time"" to consider whether she wants to stand for Labour at the general election.. The Labour peer said the party's treatment of her ""dear friend"" had been ""appalling,"" and she hit out at briefings she would be barred from running.. Ms Abbott, a shadow cabinet minister under former leader Jeremy Corbyn, has represented the Hackney North and Stoke Newington seat since 1987.. Asked about a Sunday Times report that Ms Abbott was among Labour MPs offered peerages by the party, Ms Cooper replied: ���I don���t know anything about that���.. Leader Sir Keir Starmer said on Friday she would be free to stand for the party, after reports that its ruling body would bar her from running.. It followed days of speculation that she would be blocked from being a candidate, despite being readmitted as a Labour MP earlier this week before Parliament was dissolved.. The move came after a 13-month investigation into Ms Abbott following the publication of a letter she wrote to a newspaper saying that Jewish, Irish and Traveller people d""all their lives"".. Ms Abbott apologised and withdrew her remarks shortly after they were published.. . Speaking to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Baroness Chakrabarti said the week's to-and-fro over whether she can stand had at times been ""sordid"".. ""It���s not good for Keir Starmer���s leadership, it���s not good for"" she added.. She hit out at ���anonymous briefings by overgrown schoolboys in suits��� for the newspaper reports she would be blocked, but added s""personally assured by the leadership"" they had not been authorised by the party.. ���I hope she will take some time to consider what she wants to do. That���s literally what I���ve suggested to her as her friend, and I hope that���s what she is going to do���.. Earlier this week, Ms Abbott said she wanted to stay on as Hackney""as long as it is possible"".. Before Sir Keir confirmed she could run, she had previously accused the party leadership of wanting to ""exclude"" her from Parliament..

Mr Swinney told activists and candidates at a rally in Glasgow that Westminster decision-making had meant ""austerity, Brexit and a cost of living crisis being imposed on Scotland"".. Scotland's first minister stressed his belief in independence as a way to ensure decisions about Scotland are made in Scotland.. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said John Swinney's ""relaunch of a shambolic campaign"" proved he was more interested in his party than the people.. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accused Mr Swinney of ""pandering to his Nationalist base and pitting Scot against Scot in a bid to break up the UK"".. Meanwhile, Scottish Lib Dems leader Alex Cole-Hamilton also criticised the SNP's continued push for a second independence referendum - insisting voters simply ""don't care"".. However, Mr Swinney has called on the public to back his party's indy stance in the 4 July general election and use the vote as a direct way to remove the Conservatives from government.. He said: ""A combination of Westminster cuts and Brexit has reduced the money available for the NHS, other public services and housing.. ""Brexit alone has wiped billions from the Scottish economy compared with EU membership. And it's pushed up food and other household costs.. ""Given the UK is moving so badly in the wrong direction I would be failing in my duty if I did not set out what I believe is a better future for Scotland."". Following his election as first minister last month, Mr Swinney called for more respect to be shown in Scottish politics.. Looking ahead to the UK-wide general election, he said he believes in ""the politics of persuasion or, if that's not possible, respectful disagreement""..  He told those at the rally that ""in our wonderful, diverse, inspiring country"" everyone should have a chance to get on in life.. ""It's why I believe so strongly in eradicating child poverty,"" the first minister will say.. ""At this election it is those principles that will guide my approach. So I am asking people to vote SNP to remove the Tories from government.. ""I'm asking people to vote SNP to put Scotland's interests first. I'm asking people to vote for a future made in Scotland, for Scotland."". Mr Swinney also highlighted what the he said the SNP had achieved in government, including:. Analysis by Phil Sim, BBC Scotland political correspondent. John Swinney���s calculation is that a Labour win is already priced in for many in this election.. At his launch event, he predicted that ���the Tories are on course for a huge defeat, a wipeout���.. The pitch is that the Tories are toast anyway, and Labour will have a big majority - so Scots don���t actually need to vote for Labour to achieve that. Indeed, he says they should vote for the SNP to keep Labour honest - to hold their feet to the fire.. He���s painting them as already being complacent - ���they think Scotland is in the bag���.. The question is whether this message - that people can have a Labour government without actually voting Labour - will cut through with voters, compared to the rather more straightforward ���change��� narrative Sir Keir Starmer is selling.. Speaking on BBC Scotland's Tilton said his party was not talking about independence during this campaign ""because literally no-one on the doorsteps is talking about it - they don���"".. He added: ""We don���t believe there should be a second referendum ��� it���s not salient to p""People want to talk about getting access to a GP at the first time of asking, or NHS dentists in their locality.. ""They want to talk about taking the sewage out of our rivers and lifting up Scottish education to where it used to be."". Speaking on the campaign trail in Renfrew, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the SNP had spent the entire campaign so far attacking Labour when the real opportunity was to ""get rid of this rotten Tory government"".. He said: ""That���s what we���re focused on ��� getting rid of Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman and the whole, rot""People across Scotland realise after 14 years of corruption, chaos, lies and sleaze from the Conservative party that this is Scotland���s opportunity to get rid of them. And the only way we do that is if we elect a UK Labour gover"". Mr Sarwar said he was confident previous SNP supporters would switch to Labour on 4 July.. ""I don���t care how you voted in the past. I don���t care how you voted in the referendum. I don���t care how you would possibly vote in fut""What I care about just now is getting rid of this rotten Tory government, so let���s go on this part of the journey together and change our co"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr Swinney had made ""a desperate attempt"" to relaunch the SNP���s election cam""in the wake of his shameful mishandling of the Michael Matheson scandal"".. Mr Matheson - a former health secretary - was last week handed a record ban from parliament for breaching Holyrood's expenses policy. . And police are now assessing a new complaint over the SNP MSP's ��11,000 iPad data roaming bill.. Douglas Ross said: ���Predictably, he (Mr Swinney) used it to double down on the SNP���s independence obsession, instead of focusing on the people���s real priorities ��� fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.. ���As he showed in the Matheson scandal, John Swinney wil"". Mr Ross added: ���Voters who have had enough of SNP incompetence and their endless sowing of division have the chance to punish them on Jul""In key seats across the country, only the Scottish Conservatives can beat the SNP and move the focus on to the issues that really matter.���.

The series has, as ever, been filled with spectacular talent and incredible acts.. A magician who used to film parody videos of auditioning for Britain's Got Talent is one of the show's finalists..

bbc.com,US expects Israel will accept Gaza ceasefire plan if Hamas does,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11l590qqwo,2024-06-02 20:42,"The US government has ""every expectation"" that Israel will accept a ceasefire proposal that would begin with a six-week cessation of hostilities in Gaza if Hamas takes the deal, according to National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. . The three-part plan unveiled by President Joe Biden last week would also be a ""surge"" of humanitarian aid, as well as an exchange of some hostages for Palestinian prisoners before a permanent end to the war. . The proposal, however, has met with vocal opposition from some members of Israel's government. . The negotiations come as fighting continues in Rafah, which came under intense Israeli airstrikes over the weekend. . According to the UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, all 36 of its shelters in the Rafah area are empty after residents were forced to flee. . Another 1.7 million people are estimated to be displaced in Khan Younis and parts of central Gaza. . Speaking to ABC News on Sunday morning, Mr Kirby said that the US had ""every expectation"" that Israel would ""say yes"" to the proposed ceasefire deal if Hamas accepts. . ""We're waiting for an official response from Hamas,"" he said, adding that the US hopes that both sides agree to start the first phase of the plan ""as soon as possible"". . During that initial six-week pause in the fighting, Mr Kirby said the ""two sides would sit down and try to negotiate what phase two could look like, and when that could begin"".. In a televised address last week, Mr Biden said that the second phase of the plan would see all remaining living hostages returned, including male soldiers. The ceasefire would then become ""the cessation of hostilities, permanently"".. On Saturday, however, two far-right Israeli ministers threatened to quit and collapse the country's governing coalition if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to the deal. . Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said they were opposed to striking any deal before Hamas was destroyed.. Similarly, Mr Netanyahu has insisted that there will be no ceasefire until Hamas���s military and governing capabilities are destroyed and all hostages are released.. Hanoch Milwidsky, a senior member of the Knesset for Mr Netanyahu's Likud Party, told the BBC on Sunday that Israel's governing coalition is unified in opposition to the deal, which he c""completely unacceptable"". . ""The math of the Israeli government has not changed - that means Hamas can no longer rule Gaza, can no longer have any capability, not military not any civilian capability to be in power, and all the hostages need to come back,"" Mr Milwidsky  said. ""The war will not stop until these demands are met."" . Mr Kirby, for his part, said that US intelligence now believes that Hamas has been militarily degraded to the extent that it can no longer repeat an attack such as that which its fighters conducted on 7 October. . ""We've not said that they don't still represent a viable threat to the Israeli people. Of course they do,"" he said. ""But they don't have the military capabilities to do what they did."" . In another development on Sunday, the government of the Maldives announced it would ban Israeli citizens from the Indian Ocean island archipelago, in turn prompting a warning from Israel's foreign ministry that its citizens should avoid the country. . About 11,000 Israelis visited the Maldives last year - less than 1% of all tourist arrivals. . More than 36,000 people have been killed across Gaza since the start of the conflict, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.. The war began in October when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to Gaza as hostages.. In the US, President Biden has faced growing domestic criticism over the level of US support for Israel, as well as calls to do more to encourage the warring sides to negotiate.. The former president says he is ""okay"" with the possibility of being jailed after his New York conviction.. At least 25 people have been shot in the US city of Akron, police say.. Donald Trump's lawyer Alina Habba tells the BBC he would run for president even if he was in jail..

bbc.com,Donald Trump says hush-money trial 'very hard' on wife Melania,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nndr47kgzo,2024-06-02 20:39,"Donald Trump has said his historic trial and criminal conviction have been ""very hard"" for his wife, former First Lady Melania Trump. . Last week, jurors found Mr Trump guilty of falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments made to former porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election campaign.. With the verdict, he became the first US president to be convicted of a crime. He has repeatedly called the trial rigged and politically motivated. . In an interview with Fox News over the weekend, Mr Trump vowed that success at the upcoming November US election would be his ""revenge"". . He is slated to be sentenced on 11 July, and plans to appeal the convictions. . Speaking to Fox on Sunday, Mr Trump said his New York legal battle has been particularly difficult on his wife. . The trial included lurid details of the alleged meeting between Mr Trump and Ms Daniels. . The details included Mr Trump greeting her in silk pyjamas at his hotel suite, and Ms Daniels' claims that he did not wear protection when they allegedly had sex. . In her testimony, Ms Daniels also claimed that Mr Trump and his wife sleep in different beds. . ""She's fine, but I think it's very hard for her,"" Mr Trump said of his wife, adding that ""in many ways, it's tougher on them [his family] than it is me"". . Under New York law, each of the 34 felony counts Mr Trump was convicted of could result in up to four years in prison - though this is not considered a likely outcome. . In his interview on Fox, Mr Trump acknowledged the possibility of being imprisoned, saying that he is ""okay with it"" but that he is ""not sure the public would stand for it"". . ""I think it would be tough for the public to take,"" he said. ""You know, at a certain point there's a breaking point."" . In another interview published over the weekend, the woman at the heart of the New York case - former adult film actress Stormy Daniels - said she was ""shocked"" at how quickly the jury reached a verdict. . In her first public remarks since the convictions, Ms Daniels told UK newspaper The Mirror that she believes Mr Trump ""should be sentenced to jail and some community service working for the less fortunate"".. ""Or being the volunteer punching bag at a woman's shelter,"" she added. . Even after the conviction, Ms Daniels said that the case is ""not over"" for her. . ""It's never going to be over for me,"" she said. ""Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy."" . Mr Trump is still facing dozens of other charges in three other criminal cases, including a Georgia case in which he is accused of conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat by President Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 election. That case is currently tied up in appeals. . In Florida - where he faces a federal case over his alleged mishandling of classified documents - a judge has indefinitely postponed the trial, saying setting a date before resolving questions about evidence would be ���imprudent���.. The White House believes Hamas has been weakened to a point that it cannot repeat the 7 October attack. . At least 25 people have been shot in the US city of Akron, police say.. He warned China not to cross a red line as their standoff in the South China Sea escalates.. It would begin with a six-week ceasefire and the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas. .

bbc.com,Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch marries for fifth time,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9ee487k1eyo,2024-06-02 14:19,"Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch has married for a fifth time in a ceremony at his Californian vineyard.. Mr Murdoch, 93, tied the knot on Saturday with his new wife Elena Zhukova, 67, a retired Russian biologist.. He was rumoured to be dating Ms Zhukova soon after his engagement to ex-police chaplain Ann Lesley Smith was abruptly called off in April 2023.. Australian-born Mr Murdoch, who has six children, is chairman emeritus of News Corporation, which owns Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the Sun and the Times.. He stepped down as chairman of Fox and News Corp last year, leaving his son Lachlan to head both companies.. Mr Murdoch and Ms Zhukova are said to have met at a party hosted by one of his ex-wives, Chinese-born entrepreneur Wendi Deng.. His other former spouses are Australian flight attendant Patricia Booker, Scottish-born journalist Anna Mann, and US model and actress Jerry Hall.. Ms Zhukova was previously married to Russian oil billionaire Alexander Zhukov, while their daughter Dasha - a socialite and businesswoman - was married to the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich until 2017.. Rupert Murdoch began his career in Australia in the 1950s - eventually buying the News of the World and the Sun newspapers in the UK in 1969.. He later purchased a number of US publications including the New York Post and Wall Street Journal.. In 1996, he launched Fox News - now the most-watched TV news channel in the US.. Through News Corp, which was founded in 2013, Mr Murdoch remains the owner of hundreds of local, national and international media outlets.. His career has not been without controversy. One of his most damaging moments was the notorious UK phone-hacking scandal that erupted after it emerged that the News of the World had listened to murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler's voicemails.. Last September, Mr Murdoch announced he was stepping back from the leading role in his media empire - handing the reins to his son Lachlan and later taking on the role of Chairman Emeritus of both Fox and News Corp..

bbc.com,South Africa president faces up to poor poll result,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx99vww50y5o,2024-06-02 22:22,"South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has admitted his African National Congress (ANC) party has suffered a challenging election result, after the party lost its majority for the first time since apartheid ended 30 years ago.. The ANC, once led by Nelson Mandela, won 159 seats in the 400-seat parliament in Wednesday's election, down from 230 in the previous assembly.. Mr Ramaphosa still described the results as a victory for democracy, calling on rival parties to find common ground - apparently preparing for coalition talks. . The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party has said it is open to coalition talks with Mr Ramaphosa, but it opposes a number of his government's key priorities. . With all the votes counted, the ANC finished on 40% - down from 58% at the previous election, the electoral commission announced on Sunday.. This was lower than the party's feared worst-case scenario of 45%, analysts said. The ANC now must go into a coalition to form the next government.. . ""Our people have spoken, whether we like it or not, they have spoken,"" Mr Ramaphosa said.. ""As the leaders of political parties, as all those who occupy positions of responsibility in society, we have heard the voices of our people and we must respect their wishes."". He added that the voters wanted the parties to find common ground.. ""Through their votes, they have demonstrated clearly and plainly that our democracy is strong and it is enduring,"" he said.. South Africa's political parties have two weeks to work out a coalition deal, then the new parliament will sit to choose a president.. The centre-right DA remains the second-largest party in parliament with 87 seats, and has said it is open to talks of a coalition.. ""We urge all others who love our constitution and all it represents to set aside petty politics and narrow sectarian interests and join hands now,"" DA leader John Steenhuisen said.. However, his party opposes two of the ANC's key priorities - its black empowerment policies, which aim to giving black people a stake in the economy following their exclusion during the racist apartheid era, and the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill, which promises universal healthcare for all. . The ANC has said both policies are non-negotiable in coalition talks. . Former president Jacob Zuma, who now leads the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party that came third with 58 seats, did not attend the results announcement and had suggested that he might challenge them.. The MK has said it would be prepared to work with the ANC, but not while it was led by Mr Ramaphosa.. He replaced Mr Zuma as both president and ANC leader following a bitter power struggle in 2018.. In a BBC interview, Patrick Gaspard, who was the US ambassador to South Africa in 2013-16, described the two politicians as ""sworn enemies"".. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Zuma called for an election rerun and said the electoral commission should not announce the final results.. On Saturday, he warned the commission that it would ""be provoking us"" if it ignored his demand for a fresh election, and for an independent investigation into his party's claims that it was rigged.. ""Don���t start trouble when there is no trouble,��� he said.. There are now concerns over how Mr Zuma's supporters may respond to the results.. The 82-year-old has been the political wildcard in this election - and he is preparing to flex his muscles as the kingmaker in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal, where the MK party has wrestled a huge chunk of votes from the ANC.. Formed just a few months ago, results show that for the national election, it has taken the largest share of the vote in the province - 44% to the ANC's 19%.. Local issues could have been a big factor in that shift, with some community members turning their backs on the ANC party because it had failed to fix acute water shortages.. Parts of the province, such as Trenance Park, which is a mere 20 minutes' drive from the main city of Durban, have had no tap water for 10 months.. Residents rely on water tankers that sometimes do not deliver water on time.. People in KwaZulu-Natal hope that now the election is over, the problem will  good.. Earlier, South Africa's police chief warned that threats to destabilise the country would not be tolerated.. ""There cannot be any room for threats of instability in order to register objections or concerns about the electoral processes,""  Police Minister Bheki Cele said at a news conference.. The ANC has always polled above 50% since the country's first democratic elections in 1994, which saw Nelson Mandela become president.. But support for the party has been dropping significantly because of anger over high levels of corruption, unemployment and crime.. ""There are tens of millions of young people in that country who are called the Born Free generation, born after 1994 after the end of apartheid, and they feel that their country underwent a political transformation, but not an economic one,"" Mr Gaspard told the BBC. . He added that back in 2015 ""it was already becoming abundantly clear that there was a downward trajectory for the ANC because it was failing to deliver on essential services in the country"", specifically mentioning rolling blackouts.. The full schedule, including start time and venues, and results for the Men's T20 World Cup 2024. . The ANC has dominated South Africa for the past 30 years but now it has to look to the future.. Cyril Ramaphosa has led the ruling ANC to its worst result since it won the first democratic vote in 1994.. The T20 World Cup is more than cricket's attempt to crack America, it is also the game finally opening its doors to the whole planet, says Stephan Shemilt..

bbc.com,New blood test 'can predict' breast cancer return,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjjjnxdv188o,2024-06-02 15:12,"An ""ultra-sensitive"" new blood test can predict if breast cancer will return years before the disease shows up on scans, researchers say.. It picks up traces of a tumour's DNA before a full relapse and was found to be 100% accurate at predicting which patients would see their cancer return.. It is hoped that the test can allow treatment to start earlier and improve survival rates.. The UK research has been branded ""incredibly exciting"" by experts but is still in its early stages.. Breast cancer is the most common form of the disease worldwide, with 2.26 million women diagnosed in 2020 and 685,000 deaths in the same year, according to Breast Cancer UK. . A team of researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) London conducted the trial on 78 patients with different types of early breast cancer.. The ""liquid biopsy"" looked for 1,800 mutations in the patients' blood which are released by cancer cells. . These circulating tumour DNA were found in 11 women, who all saw their cancer relapse. No other women saw their cancer return. . On average, the blood test detected cancer 15 months before symptoms appeared or the illness showed up on scans,  according to results presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago on Sunday.. The earliest detection was 41 months before a scan confirmed the diagnosis. . Lead researcher Dr Isaac Garcia-Murillas, from the ICR, said: ""Breast cancer cells can remain in the body after surgery and other treatments but there can be so few of these cells that they are undetectable on follow-up scans."". He added that the cells can cause patients to relapse many years after their initial treatment.. Dr Garcia-Murillas said the study lays the groundwork for better post-treatment monitoring and potentially life-extending treatment.. Researchers tested blood samples at the point of diagnosis, then again following surgery and chemotherapy.. These tests were then repeated every three months for the next year and every six months for the next five years.. Dr Simon Vincent, director of research, support and influencing at Breast Cancer Now - which part-funded the study - said: ""Early detection is one of our greatest weapons against breast cancer and these initial findings, which suggests new tests could be able to detect signs of breast cancer recurrence over a year before symptoms emerge, are incredibly exciting."". Though acknowledging that the research was still in its early stages, he said catching breast cancer recurrence earlier means treatment is much more likely to destroy the cancer and stop it spreading to other parts of the body and becoming incurable. . Dr Vincent continued: ""With around 11,000 people dying every year in the UK from secondary breast cancer, breakthroughs like these are urgently needed so that we can stop people losing their lives to this devastating disease."". It is unclear when the test could become widely available. . The news follows a number of developments in cancer research in the past week.. It comes after saliva tests carried out at home were found to be better at identifying men at higher risk of prostate cancer than standard blood tests.. And on Friday it was announced that thousands of NHS cancer patients in England are expected to get access to trials of a new type of treatment using personalised vaccines to fight their disease.. But on Monday a cancer charity said the number of melanoma skin-cancer cases in the UK was expected to hit record levels.. Colin Burgin-Plews hopes to do more races in the future after recovering from cancer operation.  . A father who survived cancer is joined by his teenage son and two friends for Voyage of Hope..

bbc.com,Tories pledge new GP surgeries in community care boost,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2289vk0n1o,2024-06-01 21:32,"The Conservatives have promised to build 100 new GP surgeries in England and boost the number of available appointments by allowing more treatments in the community if they win the election. . The party says it would also expand the number of treatments pharmacies can offer without people seeing their GP first. . Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the plan would make it easier for patients to get the care they need and help relieve pressure on hospitals.. Labour said the announcement was the ""latest empty promise"" from the Tories on health.. . The Tories said they wanted to expand the Pharmacy First scheme, which was launched in January and allows people in England to go to their local pharmacy for seven common conditions, rather than their GP, as well as get a prescription for the oral contraceptive pill. . Under the party's plans for the next parliament, pharmacies would also be able to offer contraceptive patches and injections, as well as treatment for more conditions, including acne and chest infections. . It said this would free up 20 million GP appointments once fully rolled out. . The party has also pledged to build 50 new Community Diagnostic Centres, which it said would deliver a further 2.5 million tests a year once scaled up. . The Tories said its plans - expected to cost ��1bn per annum - would be paid for by cutting the number of NHS managers to pre-pandemic levels and halving management consultancy spend across government. . It said an overhaul of planning guidance would also help pay for 100 new GPgeries and 150 surgery modernisations, by ensuring health gets a bigger proportion of contributions from housing developers. . Mr Sunak said: ���As part of our clear plan we are investing in community services making it quicker, easier and more convenient for patients to receive the care they need and help to relieve pressure on hospital ser"". Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said: ���Pharmacies, GPs and Community Diagnostic Centres are the backbone of our NHS. Because of bold action we have taken, they are more accessible in more places for more p"". The National Pharmacy Association said the plan to extend the pharmacy scheme was an ""affordable way to cut waiting times"". . But the association's chief executive, Paul Rees, said community pharmacies were currently ""chronically underfunded"" and more investment to was needed to prevent closures and the system being ""irreparably damaged���.. The Conservatives said 98% of pharmacies had signed up to the scheme and those already involved were receiving more funding.. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting accused the Conservatives of  breaking their last manifesto promise to recruit more GPs.. He said: ���Labour will train thousands more GPs and cut the red tape that ties up GPs time, so we can bring back the family doctor.���. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have pl""ticking time bomb"" for the NHS with a funding boost for health checks. . The party's manifesto will include a commitment to increase the Public Health Grant, which it says will help fund health checks for 40-74-year-olds, health visits for infants and their mothers, and wider access to blood pressure tests. . The grant provides funding to local authorities to spend on preventative services to improve public health. . Deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the policy would reverse the ""scandalous"" cuts made by the Conservatives since 2015. . ""It is time to recognise that it is far cheaper to prevent ill health than to treat it,"" she said.. The party said ��1bn of investment in the grants per year would be funded through a crackdown on tax evasion. .

bbc.com,Starmer promises to cut net migration if Labour wins election,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn331vd99lzo,2024-06-02 17:35,"Labour is promising to cut net migration to the UK if it wins the election next month, but will not set an overall target.. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her party would reduce the need for overseas workers by improving training of British workers.. She argued that not setting a target was ""sensible"" because the Conservatives had ""discredited the whole system"" by previously missing targets.. But the Tories said ""no-one believes Keir Starmer is serious about tackling immigration"". . Speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Cooper acknowledged that new salary levels announced by the government were yet to ""play through"" and would further restrict companies' access to work visas.. But she added that Labour wanted to go further to cut reliance on foreign workers in sectors including construction, IT, social care, health and engineering.. The party says if it wins power, it will pass a new law to force different parts of the government to draw up skills improvement plans in high-migration sectors. It is not yet clear how these plans would be enforced.. Ms Cooper said Labour wanted to see ""significant changes in place��� across the economy to reduce reliance on overseas workers.. But she added the party would not set a migration target because the Conservative""ended up being totally all over the place"" when they did.. She also argued that other factors would produce variations ���from one year to an"" citing the pandemic and the UK's decision to accept Ukrainian refugees as recent examples.. Leader Sir Keir Starmer told the Sun on Sunday: ""Mark my words, a future Labour government will bring down net migration."". Last year, net migration - the number of people coming to the UK, minus the number leaving - was 685,000, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.. Earlier this year, the government introduced new laws designed to cut immigration numbers.. They included increasing the minimum salary requirement for some skilled work visas by nearly 50%, as well as increasing the salary requirement for skilled workers to bring family dependents with them.. Ms Cooper said Labour supported those changes, acknowledging they would ""lead to further restrictions on visas"".. Labour also wants to lengthen the bans on hiring foreign workers that can be handed down to firms that breach employment law, such as by paying below the minimum wage.. A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said the Labour policy announced on Sunday was a ""U-turn"" on Sir Keir's principles.. ""This is the man who called all immigration laws racist and voted against tougher border controls 139 times,"" the spokesperson said.. That refers to a book review Sir Keir wrote when he was a lawyer in the late 1980s, in which he said the author had highlighted the ""racist undercurrent which permeates all immigration law"".. Alison Thewliss, from the SNP, said: ���Instead of coming forward with policies based on Scotland���s needs, Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are both amping up the far-right belief that migrants are to blame for all of our problems - but it���s not migrants, i"". ""From our care sector and our NHS to our economy, the cruel immigration policies that both the Tories and Keir Starmer���s Labour have now adopted directly harm Sco"" she said..

bbc.com,"Focus on GDP not way to fairer society, say Greens",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511lz64rrpo,2024-06-02 13:50,"The co-leader of the Green Party has told the BBC that finding different ways to measure economic success would help build a fairer society.. The party has long argued that economic growth drives over-exploitation of resources and should not be the default aim for governments.. Adrian Ramsay said relying on gross domestic product (GDP) to judge the state of the economy was a ""blunt instrument"".. He added that a ""wider range of economic measures"" should be reflected when deciding what policies to pursue. . It marks a contrast with other political parties, which usually put their plans to boost economic growth front and centre in election campaigns.. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Ramsay defended his party's approach, adding they had a ""strong message about the sort of economy we want to see"".. ""The principle for Greens is that just using GDP as a measure of economic success is a blunt instrument,"" he added.. He added that the statistic ""doesn���t tell us about how unequal our socie"" or whether public services are working, or measure impacts on the environment.. ""We need to have a wider range of economic measures which are about health and happiness, prosperity, jobs, public services,"" he added.. He added that policies such as its proposed tax on the wealthiest 1% would help fund improvements to the NHS.. The UK's main GDP measure is produced by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and tries to measure the overall size of the economy.. It plays an important role in deciding tax and spending decisions, because the government relies on official forecasts for GDP to work out which policies are affordable.. It is also expected to play a major role in the UK's general election campaign. . Rishi Sunak cited economic growth figures in his speech announcing the poll, whilst Labour has made achieving the ""highest sustained growth"" in the G7 club of wealthy nations one of its five missions for power. . In recent years, a number of alternative measures have been developed that try to capture other aspects of the economy.. Since 2010, the ONS has also measured well-being, external alongside economic growth. This assesses health, relationships, education and skills, as well as people's personal finances and the environment.. However, critics say GDP still occupies too important a role in debates about the economy. . In documents setting out their philosophy, the Greens say it promotes a focus on ""consumerism"" and other indicators would better capture the extent to which economic policies protect nature and improve well-being.. . The Green Party of England and Wales is separate to the Scottish Greens, which stands candidates in Scotland.. It is aiming to run in every English and Welsh seat for the first time, requiring it to pick 103 more candidates than at the last election in 2019.. However, it is expected to focus on a small number of target seats, including the new seat of Waveney Valley, where Mr Ramsay is the party's candidate.. Other targets include the new seat of Bristol Central, North Herefordshire, and Brighton Pavilion, where the Greens only current MP, Caroline Lucas, is standing down..

It comes after the Conservative candidate for High Peak in Derbyshire, Robert Largan, put out a social media post on Saturday in red Labour colours saying ""Labour for Largan"".. He also put out a social media post, using the colours of Reform UK, with the slogan ""Reform for Robert"".. The Conservative Party said: ���The materials clearly carry imprints, as required by electora"".

Mr Sunak's announcement ended months of speculation about when the UK would go to the polls.. The general election is to elect Members of Parliament - or MPs - to the House of Commons..

bbc.com,What do candidate selections tell us about Starmer's Labour?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c800g7qlrjzo,2024-06-02 00:22,"Sir Keir Starmer has been accused of freezing out left-wingers and promoting his supporters, as Labour heads into the general election.. The party now has a full slate of candidates in place after scrambling to fill vacancies following the surprise announcement that the election is taking place on 4 July.. The process has been dominated by a bitter row over whether veteran MP Diane Abbott, an ally of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, will be allowed to stand.. At the same time, the party has been accused of ""parachuting"" Starmerite candidates into seats over the wishes of local Labour members.. The full list of candidates will now have to be endorsed at a meeting of the national executive committee (NEC), the party's ruling body, on Tuesday.. But has Sir Keir really banished the left - and what do the selections tell us about what the party would look like in Parliament if it wins power? . The Labour leader cannot hire and fire candidates at will ��� but he does have a lot of power over the kind of people that get chosen.. The vast majority of the party's election candidates were already in place before the election was called, selected by local branches from centrally-approved longlists.. But the short time before polling day on 4 July has reduced the role of local members, with the national party following an accelerated process to fill target seats, or where MPs are standing down or suspended.. In this case it is a panel of NEC members - a committee dominated by Starmer supporters - who review applications and choosparty's candidate. . The roll call of new faces contains potential clues as to what a Starmer government would look like if the Labour leader enters the doors of Downing Street in five weeks' time.. Candidates close to the Labour leadership include Heather Iqbal, a former adviser to Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, and Chris Ward, Sir Keir's former deputy chief of staff. . Mr Ward has been chosen to fight Brighton Kemptown, the seat which was held by Lloyd Russell-Moyle. . The left-winger says he has been made a ""sacrificial lamb"" after he was suspended by the party this week over a complaint about his behaviour, which he said was ""vexatious and politically motivated"". . In Chingford and Woodford Green another figure on the left of the party - Faiza Shaheen - was blocked from standing and replaced with a Starmer supporter. . Shama Tatler, a councillor in Brent, is co-chair of the Labour To Win group, which was launched to support Sir Keir's leadership after his election.. Perhaps the most politically on-brand selection is Georgia Gould, the leader of Sir Keir's local Camden council and daughter of Blair-era strategist Lord Philip Gould.. As head of the north London authority, she has championed the ""mission-driven"" approach to governing, with teams organised around broad long-term goals, which Sir Keir has put at the heart of his plan for power.. Policy experts from Starmer-friendly think tank Labour Together are also on the list.. These include Josh Simons, who resigned as a party policy adviser after seven months under Mr Corbyn's tenure and is now its candidate in the safe seat of Makerfield.. Long-regarded as a sounding board for the Starmerite wing of the party, Labour Together has donated staff to several shadow cabinet ministers and is expected to be influential in shaping the party's manifesto.. Another candidate from the think tank world is Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, which has a focus on low pay.. One other eye-catching feature of recent selections is those who have a military background, perhaps reflecting Sir Keir's focus on the importance of national security. . These include former Royal Marine Colonel Alistair Carns and RAF pilot Calvin Bailey. . The installation of pro-Starmer candidates - and the blocking of some left-wingers - has led to accusations of a last-minute ""purge"" before the election.. But the Starmification of the Labour machine has been going on under the radar for some time. . Elections to the NEC in 2020 were a key moment, with Sir Keir solidifying his grip on the committee through the election of candidates who stood on a pro-leadership platform. . Several of these NEC members have now been chosen to fight very winnable parliamentary seats. . Labour To Win activists Luke Akehurst and Gurinder Singh Josan, who have been vocal Starmer supporters, have been chosen as the candidates for North Durham and Smethwick, which both have healthy Labour majorities. . But while the left of the party has no doubt been weakened by the ousting of key figures like Mr Corbyn, it has not been obliterated altogether. . Sir Keir has now said Ms Abbott will be allowed to stand for Labour if she chooses to. . More than 25 members of the Socialist Campaign Group remain Labour candidates, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Richard Burgon and Zarah Sultana. . If Labour wins power, the smaller its majority the more powerful this bloc will be as Sir Keir may have to rely on their votes to pass legislation. .

We're now well into the election campaign, and Parliament has officially been dissolved, but there's been no real shift in the polls since Rishi Sunak fired the starting gun on 22 May, writes BBC senior political analyst Peter Barnes.. On average, Labour has been on 44% or 45% since then and the Conservatives have been on 23% or 24%.. The other parties haven't seen any movement either.. There has been quite a big spread between the different pollsters though. Labour's lead has been as low as 12% in one poll but as high as 27% in others.. Much of this difference is down to how the different polling companies handle people who say they don't know how they'll vote.. As we get closer to polling day, the number of undecided voters should fall which might mean that the polls begin to converge.. However, it's unclear whether this will have an impact on the parties' average poll ratings.. All polls are based on a sample of people interviewed, typically more than 1,000, which is then weighted to be representative of the country.. There is always a margin of error, meaning the real percentage could be higher or lower than any one poll suggests..

The polls we include have come from BMG, Deltapoll, Electoral Calculus, Find Out Now, focaldata, Ipsos, JL Partners, More in Common, Opinium, Panelbase, People Polling, Redfield and Wilton Strategies, Survation, Techne, Verian (formerly Kantar Public), WeThink (formerly Omnisis), Whitestone Insight and YouGov.. We only include the headline percentages on voting intention, which pollsters calculate by excluding those people who answered ""don't know"" or ""won't vote"".. Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK. People surveyed do not get the option to choose parties which only stand in Northern Ireland.. We include data that is in the public domain. Some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time.. Where polling companies have stated in their data tables who their client is, we have included this in our table. It is common for polling companies to do their work for news organisations, television programmes and campaign groups. . The true position for the Conservatives and Labour might be within five percentage points of our average.. Nine out of 10 polls just before election day have been within that range of the eventual national vote shares in the 2010 to 2019 general elections.. The gap has been smaller for other parties which campaign throughout Great Britain and smaller still for the SNP and Plaid Cymru.. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls.. A party's share on any given day is the average of their results from polls taken over the previous fortnight. We only take the most recent poll from each company for that day's averages.. All opinion polls will differ a bit because they are interviewing different people. There are also other things that can lead to differences between polling companies. For example:. Different companies find the people who take part in their polls in different ways. The precise wording of the question varies between pollsters, and some pollsters ask more than one question to reach their voting intention figures. Pollsters apply ""weights"" to their data to try to make their results reflect the make-up of the voting population. So if a particular poll has a smaller proportion of female respondents than there are in the wider population, their responses will be given extra weight in the final results. But different companies take different factors into account. The companies have different ways of treating people who initially say they do not know how they will vote, or are not certain if they will vote.. For voting intention, polling companies typically ask interviewees a question along the lines of: ""If a general election were held tomorrow, which party would you vote for?"". Some polling companies have not given their interviewees the choice of some parties, including them within the ""other"" category.. For example, Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party until 2021, has only been included as an option in every poll featured in our tracker since autumn 2022, while support for Plaid Cymru is included among ""other"" parties in polls released by Techne..

bbc.com,SNP's Swinney to urge voters 'to put Scotland's interests first',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crggnq0yq99o,2024-06-02 16:41,"John Swinney has urged people to ""vote SNP to put Scotland's interests first"" as he formally launched the party's general election campaign.. Mr Swinney told activists and candidates at a rally in Glasgow that Westminster decision-making had meant ""austerity, Brexit and a cost of living crisis being imposed on Scotland"".. Scotland's first minister stressed his belief in independence as a way to ensure decisions about Scotland are made in Scotland.. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said John Swinney's ""relaunch of a shambolic campaign"" proved he was more interested in his party than the people.. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accused Mr Swinney of ""pandering to his Nationalist base and pitting Scot against Scot in a bid to break up the UK"".. Meanwhile, Scottish Lib Dems leader Alex Cole-Hamilton also criticised the SNP's continued push for a second independence referendum - insisting voters simply ""don't care"".. However, Mr Swinney has called on the public to back his party's indy stance in the 4 July general election and use the vote as a direct way to remove the Conservatives from government.. He said: ""A combination of Westminster cuts and Brexit has reduced the money available for the NHS, other public services and housing.. ""Brexit alone has wiped billions from the Scottish economy compared with EU membership. And it's pushed up food and other household costs.. ""Given the UK is moving so badly in the wrong direction I would be failing in my duty if I did not set out what I believe is a better future for Scotland."". Following his election as first minister last month, Mr Swinney called for more respect to be shown in Scottish politics.. Looking ahead to the UK-wide general election, he said he believes in ""the politics of persuasion or, if that's not possible, respectful disagreement""..  He told those at the rally that ""in our wonderful, diverse, inspiring country"" everyone should have a chance to get on in life.. ""It's why I believe so strongly in eradicating child poverty,"" the first minister will say.. ""At this election it is those principles that will guide my approach. So I am asking people to vote SNP to remove the Tories from government.. ""I'm asking people to vote SNP to put Scotland's interests first. I'm asking people to vote for a future made in Scotland, for Scotland."". Mr Swinney also highlighted what the he said the SNP had achieved in government, including:. Analysis by Phil Sim, BBC Scotland political correspondent. John Swinney���s calculation is that a Labour win is already priced in for many in this election.. At his launch event, he predicted that ���the Tories are on course for a huge defeat, a wipeout���.. The pitch is that the Tories are toast anyway, and Labour will have a big majority - so Scots don���t actually need to vote for Labour to achieve that. Indeed, he says they should vote for the SNP to keep Labour honest - to hold their feet to the fire.. He���s painting them as already being complacent - ���they think Scotland is in the bag���.. The question is whether this message - that people can have a Labour government without actually voting Labour - will cut through with voters, compared to the rather more straightforward ���change��� narrative Sir Keir Starmer is selling.. Speaking on BBC Scotland's Tilton said his party was not talking about independence during this campaign ""because literally no-one on the doorsteps is talking about it - they don���"".. He added: ""We don���t believe there should be a second referendum ��� it���s not salient to p""People want to talk about getting access to a GP at the first time of asking, or NHS dentists in their locality.. ""They want to talk about taking the sewage out of our rivers and lifting up Scottish education to where it used to be."". Speaking on the campaign trail in Renfrew, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the SNP had spent the entire campaign so far attacking Labour when the real opportunity was to ""get rid of this rotten Tory government"".. He said: ""That���s what we���re focused on ��� getting rid of Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman and the whole, rot""People across Scotland realise after 14 years of corruption, chaos, lies and sleaze from the Conservative party that this is Scotland���s opportunity to get rid of them. And the only way we do that is if we elect a UK Labour gover"". Mr Sarwar said he was confident previous SNP supporters would switch to Labour on 4 July.. ""I don���t care how you voted in the past. I don���t care how you voted in the referendum. I don���t care how you would possibly vote in fut""What I care about just now is getting rid of this rotten Tory government, so let���s go on this part of the journey together and change our co"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr Swinney had made ""a desperate attempt"" to relaunch the SNP���s election cam""in the wake of his shameful mishandling of the Michael Matheson scandal"".. Mr Matheson - a former health secretary - was last week handed a record ban from parliament for breaching Holyrood's expenses policy. . And police are now assessing a new complaint over the SNP MSP's ��11,000 iPad data roaming bill.. Douglas Ross said: ���Predictably, he (Mr Swinney) used it to double down on the SNP���s independence obsession, instead of focusing on the people���s real priorities ��� fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.. ���As he showed in the Matheson scandal, John Swinney wil"". Mr Ross added: ���Voters who have had enough of SNP incompetence and their endless sowing of division have the chance to punish them on Jul""In key seats across the country, only the Scottish Conservatives can beat the SNP and move the focus on to the issues that really matter.���.

bbc.com,Labour plans apprenticeship funding shake-up,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511058gzdpo,2024-06-01 21:31,"Labour is promising to give businesses more flexibility over how they spend government money currently earmarked for apprenticeships if they win the July election.. Shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson says the party will allow businesses to use up to 50% of the cash provided by the government to fund apprenticeships or training for existing staff.. Labour previously outlined the plan to ""tackle skills shortages"" but the announcement gives more detail on how it hopes it would work in practice.. It comes after the Conservatives said they would scrap some university courses to fund more apprenticeships.. The Conservative Party said Labour���s proposa""ill thought through"".. Apprenticeships are partly funded by money raised through taxes, as well as through an ""apprenticeship levy"" paid by bigger businesses with an annual wage bill of more than ��3m.. Those firms, as well as smaller businesses, can then use that money to train apprentices.. Labour's plans for what it has terme""growth and skills levy"" involve giving businesses the choice to spend up to half of the money they receive to train existing staff in ""high-level technical skills"" such as retrofitting or engineering.. Under the plans, employers could also offer ""pre-apprenticeship training"" courses to prepare people for full apprenticeships or jobs.. A minimum of 50% of the money from the levy would still be reserved for apprenticeships.. They say that any courses will need to be from an approved list of essential skills, which could include areas like digital and green skills, social care or childcare and that businesses would not be able to use it on internal training such as HR or health and safety.. Labour said that if businesses used just 3% of the additional flexibility, it could generate 150,000 traineeships for young people.. Bridget Phillipson said the plans would create a ""golden age of lifelong learning"".. She added: ""Labour will put businesses in the driving seat of creating the opportunities people need to get on in work."". A spokesperson for the party said they had no plans to increase the levy.. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said Labour's plans would halve the number of apprenticeships and disadvantage small and medium-sized businesses.. ���Since 2010, we have built a world-class apprenticeship system from the ground up... creating pathways to 70% of occupations through apprentice"" . The Liberal Democrats said its own plans involved giving every adult a ""pot of money"" over their working life to spend on education and retraining.. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that in order for apprenticeship plans laid out by any party to be a success, more businesses need to be convinced to take up the funding available.. Imran Tahir, a Research Economist at the IFS, said: ���Both main parties have now set out aspirations to increase the number of employees - and especially young employees - in training or apprenticesh""Ultimately, employers will decide how to use the funding, and presently many are choosing not to take up the funding that is available. . ""If these new programmes are to benefit the youngest employees, either party would have to convince employers shift their current patterns, which see nearly half of apprenticeships funded by the levy being taken by employees aged 25 and up."". David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said the plans were a ""good first step"" in transforming the current apprenticeships levy which, he says, ""has not delivered for young people"".. He added: ""I would like to see more commitment to grow training and skills funding in colleges for those adults who need to learn in a rapidly changing world. . ""Without an urgent and significant growth in opportunities in colleges, millions of adults risk being left behind as technology changes."". According to the IFS, average employer spending on training has fallen by 27% in real terms since 2011, and public spending on adult education and skills is down 31% over the same period.. The number of adults on further education courses has declined by around 50% since 2010, from roughly 3.5 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2023.. The number of people completing apprenticeships has also fallen in recent years.. In England, 54.6% of apprentices completed and passed a final assessment in 2022-23, which is far below the government's 67% target by the end of 2024-25.. A report by the Department for Education in March 2022 suggested that four in 10 people who did not complete their apprenticeships cited personal reasons such as mental health issues, caring responsibilities or career changes. . However, about four in 10 also said that the apprenticeship was badly run, they were not given enough time for training or that it did not meet their expectations.. There are no UK-wide figures for the number of apprentices, but there were 752,200 in England in 2023, which is higher than during disruption from the Covid pandemic, but lower than in the mid-2010s..

bbc.com,Labour's long war inflicts Starmer's first campaign stumble,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7220exjzvno,2024-05-31 23:04,"���We���ll have to take them apart, piece by piece.���. A former Labour cabinet minister almost spat the words out in anger. I have never forgotten that conversation, even though it was nearly 10 years ago, because their fury was so hot, coming off them in waves.. The senior politician who was spitting chips in the summer of 2015 was apoplectic that the Left had propelled their man, Jeremy Corbyn, to Labour���s top job.. They were frustrated that Ed Miliband had allowed thousands of new Labour Party members to flood in, paying only ��3 to join up, many of whom had gone on to elect Mr Corbyn leader. They were also depressed at the prospect of having to go through, as he saw it, the long, painful process of dismantling the Left all over again.. Memories of election drubbings in the 1980s and late-night party meetings in crowded rooms above South London pubs, as he and his allies battled to take the Left apart ���piece by piece���, were still raw.. This week���s row over the future of Diane Abbott must be understood in the context of the decades-long battle for supremacy between different wings of the Labour Party.. It���s a fight between the radical flank on the left and those who believe their tradition is closer to the public���s heartbeat. History suggests the outcome of that battle can have a direct impact on their election results. The party���s two worst defeats in modern times were under Michael Foot and Jeremy Corbyn, both from the left-wing tradition. Of course, there were particular circumstances in both cases.. Sir Keir Starmer may have been part of Mr Corbyn���s team but the Left���s power has waned under his leadership. He has sought to prise their fingers from the party machine and gain control, you might say, ���piece by piece���.. But the latest piece of that process has resulted in a ���massive own goal���, as one Labour source described it to me. It was widely thought that after a long career as the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, Diaarliament and an icon on the Left - would want to stand down from her seat at this general election.. Just after the election date was announced, she was brought back into the fold as a Labour MP after a long suspension over comments she made in a letter to a newspaper that were seen as antisemitic and also offensive to Irish and Traveller people.. Now, it was thought, she could depart politics with dignity, rather than being handed her P45. But all that changed when a newspaper report appeared suggesting she would be banned from standing even if she wanted to.. ���She was looking for a way to stand down with dignity then it was blown all up,��� one shadow cabinet member told me.. Keir Starmer faced a backlash from the left of his party and others ��� but repeatedly insisted she had not been banned ��� and it would be up to Labour���s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) to decide Ms Abbott���s fate.. . Listen to Laura read this piece: Labour's long war inflicts Starmey afternoon he tore up that position and declared that Ms Abbott was free to be a Labour candidate if she wanted to be.. This move threatens to give the impression that Sir Keir has picked a fight with the Left but wasn���t quite strong enough to win it.. The Tories have a shiny new attack line to hurl at Labour. And it has allowed the Labour left, who Starmer had kept at bay, to crow, with the campaign group, Momentum straight out of the blocks with a triumphant statement: ���You come at the Queen you better not miss!���. It might have been preferable to back down publicly when he did, rather than allowing this row to run until Tuesday when the NEC was meant to make the final call.. A senior ally of the leader argued on Friday afternoon ""Everyone was aware of the symbolism. We had to to draw a line, it couldn���t just go on a"". But it is still not official that Ms Abbott will definitely be a Labour candidate in Hackney. It���s a messy, partial end to a fight the Labour leadership didn���t need to have.. Whatever happens to Diane Abbott, the left-right argument has roared back, just as Labour should be hitting its campaigning stride.. There are public screams of ���purge���, from parts of the Left and on some of the front pages. A senior union figure told me the leadership is ���using the chance to settle scores, it is obvious what is going on. It is a real power move���.. But the official story from Team Starmer is that they are just trying to find the best possible candidates for the election. If that, by implication, means saying cheerio to some existing MPs, so be it.. But another Labour source told me: ���Keir is more interested in competence than ideology��� there is obviously a role for the left of the Labour Party but it has to be as part of a team rather"". The truth of what is going on?. It���s perhaps a mixture of both.. The ���blue suits��� as they are sometimes nicknamed, the (mainly) youngish men who eagerly work for Keir Starmer, not surprisingly, do want to make sure that the party is standing candidates who will work hard and well, and once elected, will be part of the project, not push against them.. That has involved in some parts of the country imposing candidates on local parties, backing former party staffers and activists closely connected with Starmer���s team as the next MP.. Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.. But is it a ���purge���, when so far only a small handful of former MPs have actually been blocked?. One experienced source on the Left tells me, there are ���elements of a purge, but elements of the leader wanting to bring in a group of people who reflect what he wants and what he wantst simply jobs for the boys, it is also a more strategic objective to assist the general direction,��� the source says.. But not everyone in the party is happy with that calm, gently critical analysis.. One former NEC member tells me: ���Labour has had great left MPs throughout its history and they���ve shut down that broad church.. ���The purge is not about change, it���s about what has been said by the leader��� they cannot let the Left get in the driving seat again.���. Labour would argue there are valid reasons why left wingers such as Lloyd Russell Moyle and Faiza Shaheen have been barred from standing at the last minute. But that is not how these former candidates and their allies on the Left see it.. Others on the Left have seen their Labour careers ended. Most notably Jeremy Corbyn himself. He was suspended by the party in 2020 over his response to an inquiry into antisemitism in the party and will now stand for parliament as an independent.. The left leaning Mle forced by boundary changes. She was defeated by Gerald Jones, a shadow minister under Keir Starmer���s leadership.. And Jamie Driscoll, who won the 2019 North of Tyne mayor contest as a Labour candidate, was barred from standing for the party in 2024.. The way Diane Abbott has been treated stands in awkward contrast to the way a string of Tories, including Natalie Elphicke, Dan Poulter and Mark Logan, have been welcomed into Labour with open arms in recent weeks.. These arguments are happening in public at deafening volume because we are in a general election campaign, when Labour wants to be seen above all else as a sensible, credible force, and when many of the public will be taking a proper look at Keir Starmer for the first time.. The worst possible time to indulge in a big, fat ��� and avoidable ��� row. The plight of Diane Abbott could have been decided many months ago. The indecision looks like ���the boys have treated her shabbily��� says one party source.. A member ofnly a few voters so far have brought the subject up on the doorstep, although they warn, ���you have to be careful how this "". One focus group conducted by the polling group More in Common on Thursday night reported the issue was raised unprompted by members of the public thinking about who to choose.. One voter switching from Conservative to Labour said: ���I worry if I was going to change from one party to another, would I trust somebody that's basically stabbing their own party member in the back?���. The group of voters it might concern the most, identified as the ���progressive activist��� by More In Common, makes up about 12% of the voting public, the most left-wing portion.. Two thirds of them, by their calculation, chose Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, in 2019. That figure has already slid to a 60%, with evidence of many shifting across to the Greens.. The local election results already demonstrated there���s been a cost from Labour���s position on Gaza, in terms of lost seats, and there���s been disappointment among some environmental activists at the party shifting on its plans, althns have been watered down.. The relief for Labour is that most of the voters who the so-called ���purge��� might upset live in big cities and student towns where they already rack up chunky majorities.. So perhaps discontent over candidate selection will not make much of a difference on polling day. There is an argument too, still made by the most enthusiastic advocates of Starmer���s efforts to distance himself from Jeremy Corbyn, that having a massive public barney with one of Mr Corbyn���s friends is evidence of how much the party has moved on.. But this argument may be too clever by half, in the context of a campaign where every vote matters.. ���Never buy into the idea that it���s a masterplan,��� says another Labour source, ���no one ever wants any public messiness - it doesn���t help���.. And, as one senior Labour MP suggested to me, the risk is the public will not come away with the impression that Starmer is different to Corbyn, they will julso to attack the Tories for fighting amongst themselves.. Does this saga also risk Keir Starmer sowing bad seeds for the future?. A powerful figure in the Labour movement told me ���some solid, middle of the road people are unhappy, people they need to keep their head when things get tough further on. There will be blowback���.. Labour have been miles ahead in the polls for many months, ���they should just chill,��� says another, ���they are more paranoid than they need to be���.. It���s suggested by that source that provoking a row over the exit of a few of Jeremy Corbyn���s fellow travellers is making the classic political mistake, fighting the last war.. If Keir Starmer is on the brink of Number 10, as the polls still suggest, maybe the logic of going after the remnants of the Corbyn regime is past its sell by date.. He has been fighting as Labour leader to show he is safe, different to the Tories but not too different. Promising change, but sensible and cre who���d previously chosen the Conservatives, to broaden the party���s appeal.. But the next Parliament may well present him with a completely different political terrain, with less Tory pressure and more from the ���broader Left���, in his own party and from the Lib Dems, Greens, SNP and Plaid too.. Souring the atmosphere as the Abbott saga threatens to do may create an uneasy ���impression of what the leadership is really prepared to do,��� as one source put it.. The fuss over one politician, Diane Abbott, is unlikely to change the result on 4 July.. Keir Starmer has successfully turned the Labour Party to concentrate on the country not its own woes, but the Abbott saga shows that internal disputes can snap back, exposing painful and ancient roots.. Political leaders have to establish their power over their parties and then demonstrate it to the public.. But wearing a party rosette is not the same as carrying blind faith in the leader - that  authority has to be proven anece by piece..

The party said the promise was in response to rising ticket prices and streaming subscription costs. . The Lib Dems said fans who wanted to watch games on TV may have to pay hundreds of pounds per year as games are split across different subscription streaming platforms including Sky Sports, TNT Sports and Amazon Prime Video. . But it is likely any change to existing arrangements would be subject to intense opposition from the Premier League and paid-for streaming platforms.. . The Lib Dems said its manifesto would promise to put 10 Premier League games back on free-to-air channels like the BBC and ITV, as well as 10 games from the Scottish Championship and 20 games from the English Football League, such as the Championship.. The party told the BBC to implement their plans they would amend the Broadcasting Act 1996, which gives the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport the power to draw up a list of sporting events which are in the ""national interest"". . Broadcast rights to these events must be offered to the main free-to-air terrestrial broadcasters on ���fair and reasonable terms���. . This would require the majority of MPs to back a change to the law. . However, in practice lobbying from the Premier League and streaming companies would be likely to sway any political debate on this issue.. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: ���The Conservative government has completely failed football fans, from breaking their promise to create a football regulator, to allowing greedy broadcasters to hide Premier League football away from millions.. ���We need to tear down the paywall and give Premier League football back to the country. It is a scandal that the country is locked out of "". Plans to set up an independent football regulator, which would have the power to sanction clubs who break financial rules, were dropped after the surprise election announcement as there was not time to pass the new law. . A Conservative Party spokesman said: ���The Liberal Democrats are just making things up at this point. They can't force TV companies to reduce subscription prices, or football clubs to make tickets cheaper, and the government remains committed to delivering the Independent Football Regulat""This is sad, desperate stuff from a party that people are struggling to take seriously."".

bbc.com,Prince William's role is changing - what does he really want to do with it?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggx4vnj43o,2024-06-01 23:41,"When Prince William presented the men���s FA Cup trophy at Wembley last weekend, he���d have been forgiven for thinking how life can come at you fast - compared with when he appeared at the same fixture last year.. A year ago he was still in the summery afterglow of the Coronation, in which the Prince of Wales had played a central role, rather tenderly supporting his father the King. The pair had been seen joking together during rehearsals.. Fast forward to summer 2024 and there have been massive unexpected pressures. Within the quartet at the heart of the monarchy ��� King Charles, Queen Camilla, Prince William and Catherine ��� both the King and Princess of Wales have""There can't be too many people whose wife and father have been diagnosed with cancer so close together. It must feel as if he is in a lonely place at times,"" says royal commentator Richard Palmer.. It���s meant that Prince William has focused much of his attention on looking after his wife and young family, understandably putting many of his other engagements on hold.. The need to avoid the politics of the UK���s general election has meant even more of his plans being curtailed, including a visit that would have focused on tackling homelessness.. While the King has returned to work with a burst of energy, it���s unavoidable that there will still need to be adjustments for his health. That���s going to mean Prince William being pushed ever more clearly into the role of hei""It must feel like the weight of the world is on him. The future of the monarchy rests on his shoulders,"" says royal author Prof Pauline Maclaran.. It doesn���t help that there���s an ocean-wide gap between Prince William and his brother Prince Harry.. And swirling around the Princess of Wales���s illness, as she continues with cancer treatment, has been a toxic swamp gas of social media gossip and crazy speculation.. It must have felt as though the royal world, used to travelling at the sedate pace of a carriage, had turned into a white-knuckle ride.. At the centre of this storm, what does Prince William himself want to achieve? If you turn off all the background noise about the royals, what does he want to do with his role?. The key word, according to sources close to the prince, is ���impact���. Rather than ribbon-cutting, photo opportunities and easy gimmicks, he wants to deliver projects that make a tangible, measurable difference.. ���He���s asking: ���How can I use my platform for good, to create positive change,��� says a royal source.. ���He hat means his projects to reduce homelessness, promote mental health issues and support environmental business through his Earthshot project.. Prince William has described his role as ���social leadership��� and his visits have been labelled as ���community impact days���.. It���s a millennial vision of monarchy, taking off the tie and actively promoting a social agenda, with language that wouldn���t be out of place in a campaigning charity.. A microcosm of his approach was seen last month, when the prince, now responsible for the Duchy of Cornwall, helped with the breaking of ground for a new health centre on the Isles of Scilly.. He���d worked with the local council to get this project at St Mary���s Community Hospital under way.. ���He's rolled up his sleeves and played a fundamental role in ensuring the work begins as soon as possible,��� says a royal source, with the impact being that ���people don't have to go to the mainland for care��ended to reduce homelessness.. It���s not particularly glitzy. Campaigners against the monarchy once described the royals as ���state-funded reality television��� ��� but the type of projects Prince William has been backing are often much less glamorous or even media-friendly.. Maybe that fits with another part of his character. He doesn���t always take the easiest path.. It���s like his football team, Aston Villa. He���s described supporting the team as a deliberate decision not to back the boringly predictable usual winners. He preferred the ���emotional rollercoaster moments��� of teams that went down as well as up.. Mind you, his father has gone a step further with this philosophical footballing ethos, supporting Burnley, who were relegated this year.. Prince William���s approach also risks criticism.. The anti""crass and hypocritical... given the excessive wealth we gift him"".. There's also the accusation that any ambition to tackle housing problems will always ultimately depend on political interventions which are outside his remit.. ���It���s a tall order and it���s not entirely clear how he���s going to achieve it. But many people will think he should be applauded for trying,��� says Richard Palmer.. . Another nagging friction is the tension between Team William and Prince Harry and Meghan, who can almost seem like a rival Californian court. While William was digging away in Cornwall, they were getting the rock star treatment in Nigeria.. Prince William has the challenge of getting serious ideas across, when he���s caught up in an improbably scripted soap opera.. There���s another generational pressure for Prince William that is only likely to increase.. A significant part of the public popularity of the monarchy now depends on the Prince and Princess of Wales. They���re like politicians who are more popular than their party.. Thh that showed Prince William and Catherine as having approval ratings of over 70%, while support for the monarchy as an institution was at 56%.. Among younger people support for the monarchy is only 34% - and it���s not until the over-50s that a majority see it in a positive way.. The significance of Prince William and Catherine���s popularity is that it stretches across age groups and different regions, at a time when a significant minority are sceptical about the monarchy.. ���The monarchy has to be relevant and he wants to modernise it,��� says Prof Maclaran.. As heir to the throne, he will also have to look in the longer term to his own reign.. ���The next few years will see him thinking through what kind of monarch he wants to be and what kind of monarch the country will need to have in the mid-21st Century,��� says historian Sir Anthony Seldon.. ���He has been defining his own agenda, much of it overlapping with his father���s interests and passions,�� unknowns for Prince William, who has such a big public platform but now has to find his own voice..

bbc.com,Evan Davis: Successful entrepreneurs don���t worry about being dif,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gg58j2yd0o,2024-06-02 00:00,"You want to step out of the world of wage slavery, and set up a business of your own? Preferably a business that will be more than a mere lifestyle for you - one that you can sell and from which you can retire on the proceeds?. Well, in thinking about your chances of success, it helps to look at those who have trodden that path and ended up with a flourishing enterprise to their name.. In the interview series The Decisions That Made Me a Leader, we spoke to half a dozen successful entrepreneurs - too small a sample from which to draw statistically useful generalisations, but large enough to spot some interesting patterns.. I was struck by three intriguing attributes that may not guarantee business success, but which do seem to help.. First, I noticed the degree of rebelliousness exuded by several of them. They never quite fitted in - perhaps not into school, or university, or into the first jobs they tried.. Duncan Bannatyne, famous as one of the original big stars of the Dragons Den TV series, certainly never fitted into the navy, from which he was court-martialed and dishonourably discharged after getting into a fight with an officer. ���I just thought it was right thing to do - he was poking me and shouting at me,��� recalls Mr Bannatyne.. His attitude, he tells me, is that ���authority should not be accepted���.. Simon Beckerman, founder of online marketplace Depop, draws a similar conclusion about himself. ���I'm quite a disob"" he says. ""I think I am unemployable."". And it���s true that when you don���t find it easy to work for anyone else, going it alone is the obvious alternative career route.. Before she created the tea mixology brand Bird & Blend Tea Co, Krisi Smith had stumbled through many jobs - including cleaning out cat pens in a cattery (even though she is allergic to cats) and w""shot girl"" selling spirits to club-goers.. ""I was always asking questions and wanting to know why we were doing something and making suggestions,��� she recalls. ���And I think that that tended to put peopl"" After seeing her employers treat staff and customers badly, she decided she wanted to run her own business ethically.. The second attribute that I noticed was a kind of impatience hard-wired into their personalities. It seems there is always an itch. They never stand still.. . But if you thought their success in business came out of some kind of life-plan upon about which they had reflected and consciously embarked, you would be missing the point.. These entrepreneurs grabbed at opportunities, and indeed grabbed opportunities to make opportunities for themselves.. Timo Armoo, who set up the social media marketing company FanBytes, says he started his first venture at school, charging other pupils to help them with their maths assignments. Then, at the age of 17, he managed to secure interviews with Sir Richard Branson, Lord Sugar and James Caan after emailing the organisers of a business summit and offering to set out chairs in exchange for a press pass.. ���I sent it and within 20 minutes I get back al saying, ���You're crazy and yes, let's d"" recalls Mr Armoo.. The impatience that one can observe even extends to the entrepreneurs leaving the very businesses they created. Self-aware founders understand the skills they have and do not have, and know that when a business matures, it often needs a management that can do the painstaking work of delivering sustainable growth, rather than one with the flair of creation and discovery.. At that point, impatience is exactly the wrong attribute. And anyway, the entrepreneurs we spoke to, being impatient, are ready to move on once the business is solid, so their minds wander to selling.. Take Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of Lastminute.com at the height of the dot-com boom during the late 1990s. She was the poster child of a new youthful entrepreneurial culture that sprung up at that time, as kids showed the grown-ups exactly what the internet was capable of.. But at the age of 31, she made the decision to step down as managing director of the company. ���It was like being in a pop band where you had thimega hit, and I didn't want that to be the only thing that defined my life,"" she says.. So to a third and final entrepreneurial attribute, which follows from the others: it���s a willingness to actually do things, rather than merely think about them. Or overthink them.. I feel this is what marks out those people - in business or perhaps even in charities or public service - that are of a genuine entrepreneurial spirit. They are the people who seem to get things done.. Some of it comes down to a kind of optimism. They believe that their own actions have a good chance of achieving something, so they are less likely than most of us to descend into a fatalistic stupor. It gets them out of bed in the morning.. Richard Walker comes from a family with a track record in business - his father was the founder of the supermarket chain Iceland, where Richard is now executive chairman. But as a young qualified chartered surveyor, Richard ""I also had this entrepreneurial itch to do my own thing"".. He was advised by the legendary property developer Tony Gallagher to move to Poland. ���So I did, because they just joined the EU. They were the size of Germany, 40 million people, very well-educated. There were no Brits living out there full-time running a private property company. So I decided I "". I���ve met a lot of entrepreneurs, and I sometimes wonder if they are deluded in their optimism. Many massively overrate their chances of success, and they often can���t even imagine the many things that may go wrong with the next idea they are toying with. They have too vivid a picture of what can go right.. But as delusions go, optimism is a blessing if you refuse to be daunted by the disappointments.. Of course, the far biggest attribute anyone in business needs is good luck. Things eventually worked out for all our guests and luck surely played a part in that.. We have not heard from the unknown names who tried to build a business, but whose efforts foundered. They may have had great judgement, business nous, all the right characteristics - but just hit the wrong product at the wrong time. That doesn���t have to have been their own fault. Things sometimes turn out bad. In business, they mostly turn out bad. . Entrepreneurs are not some kind of special breed. We all have our eccentricite and we all get things done. And we don���t want to be fatalistic in thinking that you are either born with entrepreneurship or you���re not. The skills of business can be learned and developed to some extent.. But if you are asking yourself, whether you are cut out to venture into a life like those of the stars of our series, it is certainly worth examining the characters they have - the flaws that turn out to be strengths and the work they have put in..

bbc.com,Global tourism is booming. These people would rather it wasn��,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl55vdjv2j3o,2024-05-31 00:28,"The message was scrawled on a makeshift wooden placard with black marker pen and was in block capitals. It said: ""Everywhere you look everyone is foreign.���. Police said there were 10,000 marchers on the streets of Palma in Majorca on the last weekend of May at the start of the summer holiday season. Their message was that tourism was making life in Palma unliveable for locals.. But why does there suddenly seem to be such a strong sense of grievance in places where for decades large numbers of tourists have been the norm?. The answer, it would seem, is complicated. A Covid hangover is definitely a factor. But so too is the fact that, globally, many more people now have the money to travel. This presents big questions about the future of tourism.. The year 2024 is set to be a record-breaking one for tourism, surpassing the previous high in 2019. It appears that the travel and tourism industry is back with a vengeance after the pandemic, with any lingering doubts over the safety of travelling now banished.. In Spain���s Balearic Islands - which include Majorca - pent-up demand post pandemic has contributed to  to such an extent that locals say they are being priced out of living in their own home towns. The BBC has reported on the story of a chef in Ibiza who has lived in his car for the past three years. Nurses, doctors and police officers are also said to be struggling to afford local rents.. It���s not hard to see why locals can end up feeling like extras in their own movie.. In spite of recessionary pressures, more people in the West feel they can afford regular foreign trips ��� indeed, some see it as an essential purchase and a virtual human right.. The sentiment is similar around 1,500 miles away on the Canary Islands. They have been a favourite for Brits for decades and tourism has become a vital part of the economy. Today it accounts for 35% of the archipelago���s GDP and 40% of its jobs.. The cost of living for locals is an issue here too.. Chris Elkington is the editor of the local newspaper for English speakers, The Canarian Weekly. He started living in Tenerife in 1991 as an 18-30 hoseen tourism flourish over the years.. But with that unchecked growth comes a downside: rental prices are too high for many locals and the average income in the Canaries is the lowest in Spain. Many hospitality staff have been forced to move away.. Mr Elkington says a constant increase in tourist accommodation has come at a price.. ���A lot of landlords are now very wary and are moving away from renting their properties out long term and turning to holiday lets via online platforms,��� he says. ���The actual number of properties available has decreased massively and the price has increased exponentially. And unfortunately it's made finding somewhere to live very, very expensive.���. But in the Canaries, affordability is not the only issue. The environmental impact of tourism is also viewed by some as increasingly unsustainable.. At a demonstration attended by 20,000 people at  the end of April, a spokesperson for the Canaries Have Had Enough collective said the situation has reached a e reached the point where the balance between the use of resources and the welfare of the population has broken down, especially over the last year.���. Mr Elkington points to the fact that tourist areas with their large number of hotels and pools can use up to six times more water than resident areas.. ���They keep building more hotels and expanding the area of tourism,��� he says. ���But unfortunately the resources that are here can't actually cope with it.���. The Tourist Trap. . The travel industry is booming with millions more people holidaying abroad each year. How can we stop overtourism and protect the planet from its impact on the environment?. . Listen now on BBC Sounds. In the Italian city of Venice, a Unesco World Heritage site, school teacher Marta Sottoriva used to get into a small boat to block the huge cruise liners that regularly entered the city centre and offloaded thousands of day-trippers. That battle has been won - cruises are now restricted to the city�a wer than 50,000 people actually live in Venice, compared to more than 150,000 in the 1970s.. Despite the cruise ship ban, Ms Sottoriva is not happy. ���I know a lot of people who even if they have money, they have an income, they can���t find houses,��� she says.. ���We are at the level at which there are more tourist beds than there are beds for locals.���. The great danger of tourism is that an area is starved of a living flourishing mixed community with schools, local amenities and regular shops and instead becomes a historic theme park. ���Disneyfied��� is the description used by a lot of protestors.. So what measures are being taken to counter overcrowding in popular destinations?. One approach is to try to regulate the flow of visitors at peak times. This can be done by charging admission fees for day-trippers and providing data to potential visitors as to when the busiest times to avoid will be. Venice has just introduced a trial ���5 fee for day trippers historical attractions are raising their charges to tourists.. The new mantra being banded around by tourist boards is ���high value, low volume���. This means catering to travellers who will spend a lot of money and are mindful of their presence in a fragile environment.. Another solution is to encourage people to avoid peak season travel and come in the ���shoulder season���. Staggering school holidays could also prevent so many families descending on the same resort over an intense six-week period.. Many in the tourism industry also talk of ���dispersal���. This means persuading tourists to go to alternative - similar, but less busy - destinations. Limiting car parking space is becoming a favoured approach to reduce the viability of coming just for day trips.. That doesn���t prevent tourist buses dropping off big groups, however. And it is hard to see how a tourist from, say South Korea, would not want to visit the Eiffel Tower and Venice, on their hard-earned firly in places that have been on the tourist trail for years that locals are feeling overwhelmed.. Hallstatt in Austria is an undeniably picturesque little lakeside Alpine village with a gorgeous panoramic view that could come out of a fairytale book. The common urban myth is that the town is the basis for Arendelle, the village in the hugely popular Disney movie Frozen.. I met a mother from South Korea who had brought her two young daughters dressed up as princesses for this very reason.. There are around 800 residents in Hallstatt who are simply dwarfed by the 10,000 or so daily visitors - many of whom descend from large tourist buses and proceed to walk around, sometimes through residents gardens, in search of the perfect selfie.. Some locals have had enough and last year a demonstration blocked the tunnel that leads road traffic into the town.. Dr Friedrich Idam, a long-time resident and urban architect, was one of them. He lives in a house on a hill that overlooks the lake. He told me that he doesn��irt tourists who only come for a day trip. He says they spend little money and have made life unbearable for him. ���There���s no more public space for me and my co-inhabitants,���""In the churchyard tourists take selfies and pose on the graves. The problem of Hallstatt is that it is so Instagrammable. If you come in your car and stay only for an hour, I say you are not welcome here.���. The mayor, Alexander Schuetz, is sympathetic but feels helpless: ���Everybody knows it���s just too much but we can���t just block the street and tell people you can���t come in because it���s a public right of way. It���s not a dead end because people go through Hallstatt going to other towns.���. Last year there was a short lived plan to stop congestion at a famous ���selfie��� site by the local council who put up a fence to block that particular viewpoint. They had to take it down when too many residents complained it blocked their own view of their beautiful lake.. And then there is the emergence of new tourist markets with the disposable income and desire to explore the world as they have never been able to before.. Tourists from China firsation in the early part of this century. And an even bigger source of international tourism is supplanting them in terms of impact.. India is the world���s fastest-growing major economy and now has the world���s largest population.  A burgeoning affluent middle class in a country of 1.4 billion people is splashing the cash on dream trips to distant destinations.. Last year, 27 million Indian tourists travelled internationally and that���s predicted to soar to 70 million by 2030. Indian airlines have placed orders for almost a thousand new aircraft in anticipation of a big rise in demand.. Deepti Bhatnagar, who started India���s first ever travel show in 2000, says social media has played a major role in fuelling demand for travel among Indians. ���They want to go to certain places to get the selfie or they think, ���That���s one of the most photographed spots,��� and they have to be there,��� she says.. The vast majority of the Indian population cannot affy requires the tiny fraction of wealthy and even super-wealthy to enter the travel market and global figures are immediately significantly boosted. There are around 500 billionaires and a million millionaires in India. And many have expensive tastes.. It���s striking that while most things in life are becoming ever-more expensive, short-haul flying remains very cheap, sometimes less than a round of drinks in the pub. Orders for new commercial planes around the world are soaring. It���s estimated 3% to 4% of greenhouse emissions are caused by aviation and that figure is expected to rise as other industries go greener faster.. Meanwhile, there is an ethical conundrum to consider here - and with it a charge of hypocrisy. Many in the West, myself included, have enjoyed the fruits of the post-war travel boom, exploring far flung parts of the world without thinking of the unwanted consequences of mass tourism. So who are we now to preach to younger generations for whom gap years and backpacking are almof passage and indeed life enhancing experiences?. And who are we to lecture people from developing economies who can only now afford to do the same?. There appears to be no simple answer to who should be where and when, something nodded to by another of those placards back in Palma..

bbc.com,Italy���s PM says fascism is ���consigned to history���. Not e,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cljj4j84r9go,2024-05-30 05:01,"They line up in military-like formation: a thousand strong, most dressed in black, some with tattoos on shaved scalps.. At the spot in Milan where Sergio Ramelli, a far-right student, was killed almost 50 years ago by anti-fascists, a leader summons his battalion of loyalists to attention. He shouts ""camerata"", or ""brother-in-arms"", and Ramelli���s name, as if delivering a roll-call. And then it comes: stiff right arms outstretched and raised, palms facing down, the fascist salute in the heart of Italy���s second city, and the crowd reply on the dead man's behalf w""Present! Present! Present!"". It's 2024, but this has frightening echoes of a century ago. While it may seem extraordinary to an outsider ��� and it was staggering to me, watching it close up ��� it is not out of the ordinary in Italy, where commemorations of this type take place every year.. Italy's current government is led by the Brothers of Italy party, which has roots in post-war fascism. Its leader, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has said her movement has completely changed and it is clear her politics are not those of the people raising their arms in Milan. But some fear she and her party have not moved far enough away from their political origins and that what was once considered the extreme is becoming m""Fascism did not die in 1945 ��� it was militarily defeated but it continued to live in the mind of many Ita"" says Paolo Berizzi, a journalist for the Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica. He has lived under 24-hour police protection for the past five years, after receiving threats from extremist groups. ""Italy has never truly come to terms with its past,"" he says.. It's now more than a century since the country���s fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, nicknamed Il Duce, or The Leader, swept to power. His totalitarian regime was marked by a brutal repression of all opponents, concentration camps and invasions abroad. Antisemitic laws persecuted Jews, and after Mussolini allied with Hitler's Germany, thousands were sent to their deaths during the Holocaust. Italy capitulated to the Allies, plunged into civil war and Il Duce was eventually captured and killed.. The country���s post-war constitution banned Mussolini's fascist party, but the movement was allowed to continue in different guises. The Movimento Sociale Italiano, or MSI, was set up by the dictator's supporters with the aim of reviving fascism and fighting communism. Officials from Mussolini's regime took jobs in state institutions. Not a single Italian was brought before war crimes tribunals.. A 1952 addition to the constitution, called the Scelba Law, prohibited groups that pursued anti-dem, glorified the principles or leaders of fascism, or used violence in its service. But it has rarely been invoked. In Germany, the law is clear that making the fascist salute is punishable by up to three years in prison. In Italy, however, it is left up to judges to decide whether the gesture is a criminal offence: a grey area that means its use has continued.. For decades, neo-fascist politicians were largely sidelined. But the decision by then-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to bring them into his coalition in 1994 marked the start of their growing legitimisation in public opinion.. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose political life began in the MSI youth wing and was the national leader of its successor movement, once praised Mussolini as ""a good politician"", adding that ""everything he did, he did for Italy"". In 2008, Mr Berlusconi appointed her a government minister.. Ms Meloni's Brothers of Italy party bears the same three-coloured flame logo adopted by neo-fascist groupings after the war, but she has progressively shifted her movement away from the far right.. Her previous rhetoric against ""ethnic substitution"" of Italians by migrants, and a supposed ""LGBT lobby"", has softened since her election as Prime Minister in 2022. She now uses language more aligned with the mainstream European right, such as talk of protecting borders and boosting Italy's birth rate.. She has dropped her criticism of the Eurozone, has formed close relationships with leaders from Washington to Brussels, and has been forthright in her support for Ukraine after its invasion by Russia. But her critics say she still winks to her political roots.. And that, some believe, makes her even less likely to support a crackdown on extremist groups. Many feel the Scelba law should have been applied in 2021, after the headquarters of Italy���s main trade union, CGIL, was violently attacked during a protest against Covid restrictions by a crowd that included members of Forza Nuova, a fringe far-right party. Demonstrators smashed windows and tried to force themselves into the building in a move reminiscent of Mussolini���s era, when the unions were attacked by his blackshirt mobs.. Forza Nuova, whiaround for more than a quarter of a century, is much further to the right than Ms Meloni���s party, advocating a total halt to immigration, and leaving NATO and the EU. Its members speak warmly of Vladimir Putin.. The party has never attracted enough votes to have MPs elected to parliament but its visibility in protests and the actions of its members, including violence against immigrants, make it and other extremist groups a thorn in the side of Italian politics. At a recent funeral, a member's coffin was draped in a swastika flag. The birthday of another official was celebrated with a cake decorated by a swastika and the Nazi s""Sieg Heil"".. Forza Nuova���s founder, Roberto Fiore, tells me the party attacked CGIL because the union had backed mandatory Covid vaccination certificates for all wor""Everyone thought of us as real freedom fighters, not fascists attacking a trade union,"" he claims.. I challenge him directly: Is he a fascist? ""If you asked me like that, I probably would say yes,"" he replies, ""but I have to complete the term and say I���m a revolutionary. Italy hasn't got the intelligence and the courage to say, well OK, fascism was good on this and that and maybe not good in other things��� I accept, I don't refuse the term"". Over the course of our interview, I push Mr Fiore on the criminal nature of Mussolini���s regime. He denies it was violent, and claims that fascist internment camps""things that happen with war"". He goes on to say that Ukraine should be part of Russia. When I put it to him that his party would be banned in countries such as Germany, he says: ""Freedom is freedom."". Out of the Shadows: Awaking Italy's Past. Mark Lowen explores whether the extreme is becoming mainstream. Watch on the BBC News channel at 13:30 on Saturday 1 June.. Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK only). . At Forza Nuova's local headquarters in the northern city of Verona, the walls are draped in racist and extremist symbols, from the US Confederate flag, to those of the self-declared pro-Russian Donetsk and Luhansk People���s Republics, along with scarves bearing the ""White Power"" and ""We are fascists - a call to arms"". The party���s deputy leader, Luca Castellini, proudly shows me a Mussolini calendar, which he claims is the most-sold calendar in Italy.. He also heads up Veron""Ultras"" - hardcore football fans. Italian stadiums have long been breeding grounds for political extremism. When the club, Hellas Verona, was promoted six years ago, Mr Castellini was filmed shouting jubilantly to supporters that the person who had paid for their success and gifted them victory had a name: ""Adolf Hitler!"" The fans cheered and began their own chant: ""We���re a fantastic team in the shape of a swastika. How great it is to be trained by Rudol"" - Hitler���s deputy. Mr Castellini was banned from the stadium after claiming that a black player could nev""truly Italian"".. When I confront him on all this, he says he would happily repeat the same Hitler chant, because it was ruled not to have been a crime. How would a descendant of Italian Jews deported to the Holocaust feel, I ask? ""I don���t know - but wars have always existed and there have always been d"" he replies. ""It can���t be my pr"". Ms Meloni���s party has distanced itself from Forza Nuova. The prime minister condemned the sacking of the trade union building and Forza Nuova���s leaders openly criticise her for some of her positions, including her steadfast support for Ukraine.. And before the election, she sought to reassure critics by releasing a video message in which she said the Italian right had ���consigned fascism to history��� and vigorously condemned the suppr""ignominious anti-Jewish laws"".. However, Ms Meloni has not discarded her heritage entirely: she still uses the fascist-era slogan ""God, homeland, family"", for example.. ""Brothers of Italy is not a fascist party ��� but it is an ideological heir to the post-fascist trad"" says journalist Paolo Berizzi. Extremist groups feel legitimised by this, Mr Berizzi adds.. Brothers of Italy is riding high in the opinion polls ahead of the upcoming European elections, way ahead of any other Italian party. If, as is expected, her grouping of European right-wingers makes resounding gains in the vote, she will entrench her political dominance in Italy and her position as a figurehead for other right-wing and far-right politicians aiming to lead their own countries.. Her critics point to the fact that she has never directly called herself an ""anti-fascist"". But Nicola Procaccini, a Member of the European Parliament with Brothers of Italy and one of Ms Meloni���s oldest political allies, insists there���s a good reason""Being anti-fascist during fascism was a very brave act, for freedom and democracy. But being anti-fascist during democracy has sometimes meant violence, and a lot of young students killed,"" he says, referring to often bloody clashes between extremist groups, and murders carried out in Italy���s post-war decades.. He insists she���s always condemned fascism - but hits out at wh""an obsession"" with the term, which he claims is whipped up by the left to scaremonger before elections.. That's vigorously denied by opponents in places like Bologna, historically the heart of anti-fascism. On the wall of the city hall are the black and white photos and names of those who died defending Bologna from fascism during the civil war of 1943-45. Beside it is another memorial, for the 85 victims of Italy���s worst terror attack: the bombing in 1980 of Bologna���s train station by neo-fascists.. Emily Clancy, the city's deputy mayor, says the fight against fascism is still profoundly rele""The far right, not only in Italy, but also around the world, is trying to find a scapegoat for people's difficulties by attacking the stranger or the migrant,"" she says. There are similarities with the early days of fascism, she says, pointing to ""attacks on the freedom of the press, censorship, freedom for the LGBT community and attacks on the liberty of women to determine what they can do on their own bodies"".. I ask whether she and her side are losing to the far right, which is making advances across the world. ""I think it���s a struggle - we haven���t lost, but definitely we have to unite and not take for granted what i"" she replies.. And what of the fascist salutes that still crop up so regularly in demonstrations? ""It���s incredible that this ha"" she adds, ""and that what should be seen as a crime of apology of fascism is downplayed as just nostalgic, or a tribute. We���re not addressing the gravity of these episodes as we s"". However, Nicola Procaccini, the MEP, says banning the gesture would be ""crazy"", adding that it���s not a call to re-introduce fascism, but a historical gesture derived from Ancient Rome - though it is one that was later adopted by the fascist re""This is cancel culture that we do not share."". And so the symbols live on - as does the belief among some that the established narrative needs rewriting. In Predappio, the birthplace of Benito Mussolini, a pilgrimage of sorts takes place every year on the anniversary of his death, where participants in military berets and clutching red roses visit his tomb.. Susanna Cortinovis, one of the mourners, praises Mussolini for introducing social security and maternity payments. ""If you���re telling me that being a mother, a Christian, paying my taxes - does that mean I���m a fascist, then yes, I�"" she says. ""And I salute, in my Roman way, my one and only head of state."". Many countries have their nostalgists, their revisionists, their conspiracy theorists - and Italy is no exception. The numbers of Duce devotees are perhaps few. But there is crossover between Mussolini propagandists and modern neo-fascists. In a society that still tolerates such ideas, images, and beliefs, the question is how much this is becoming normalised - at a time when right-wing parties elsewhere in Europe are looking to Italy as an example.. ""Fascists have always nurtured a desire for revenge,"" says the journalist Paolo Berizzi. ""And they say: 'Very well, we return to power, we are not dead, we have not disappeared.' They pursue a revenge on history."". BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

bbc.com,Burrow was sporting great and inspiring MND campaigner,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/articles/crggwy1wp96o,2024-06-02 19:16,"This video can not be played. Rob Burrow was a Super League star before becoming an MND campaigner. A champion on and off the field, the determination, courage and humility of Rob Burrow guaranteed a legacy that stretches way beyond the sport he loved.. At 5ft 5in, Burrow was among the smallest men in rugby league, but he became one of its biggest names.. Father, family man, friend, competitor, campaigner. His death aged 41 comes nearly five years after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.. When Burrow learned of his illness, he told his wife Lindsey: ""Thank God it's me and not the kids."". His stoic resilience helped to transform the profile of this condition. His moving story was brought to millions by the BBC Breakfast team who became friends.. Decorated for his talents, Burrow played 492 times for Leeds Rhinos, won eight Grand Finals, three World Club Challenges and two Challenge Cups, as well as 15 England and five Great Britain caps.. Rugby league legend Burrow dies aged 41. Tributes paid to Rob Burrow following death at 41. A mural was painted on the side of Leeds Beckett University's Student Union to honour Rob Burrow. With his slight frame and diminutive stature, Burrow always stood out among the hulks of the modern rugby league game, from his junior days right through to the elite.. What he lacked in size, he made up for in devastating speed, evasiveness and skill, and he honed his tackling technique to enable him to compensate when it came to felling far bigger opponents.. One moment which best summed up his qualities was his try in Leeds' 2011 Grand Final win against St Helens, when having stepped off the bench at hooker, he ducked through the line and in full flight stepped his way past international full-back Paul Wellens to score a remarkable solo effort.. There was also the emotion of his final game in 2017, when he and long-time friend Danny McGuire - two members of Leeds' oft-referred 'golden generation' - bowed out together with Grand Final success at Old Trafford against Burrow's hometown club Castleford.. Rob Burrow (right) lifts the Super League trophy with Danny McGuire following Leeds' Grand Final win over Castleford in 2017 - their final game for the club. On Burrow's retirement that year, Leeds head coach Brian McDermott said: ""Rob will be remembered as one of the greats of our game, not just in the Super League era but throughout the history of the sport."". He initially continued to work in rugby league after hanging up the boots, helping to develop the next generation at Headingley with the club he loved.. It was his resolve and positive outlook after his career ended that brought this unique character to a wider audience.. Burrow revealed he had been diagnosed with MND in December of 2019. There is no cure.. He would gradually lose his ability to talk, to move, and to breathe easily.. ""It's heartbreaking,"" consultant neurologist Dr Agam Jung told a BBC documentary on Burrow.. ""You may not be able to speak, you may not be able to swallow, you may not be able to breathe independently, you have weakness in your arms and legs. This leads to dependency and a reduced life span."". This video can not be played. How Rob Burrow's life changed after his diagnosis - from Rob Burrow: Living with MND. Burrow married his childhood sweetheart Lindsey in 2006 and the couple had three children together.. ""He always says, 'find somebody else, you're still young',"" Lindsey said in the documentary, discussing the prospect of a future without her husband. ""There will never be anyone else. No-one can ever take Rob's place."". His parents, Geoff and Irene, would help to feed Burrow.. Alongside looking after children Macy, Maya and Jackson and working as a physio in the NHS, Lindsey was effectively his primary carer - her love shining through during the difficult days since his diagnosis.. ""Yes, it is sad, but it is a story full of love, hope and optimism,"" she said.. Burrow lost weight and could not kick a ball with his son or change a nappy, but he retained his spirit despite losing his independence.. A little smile. A defiant thumbs-up. ""My mind is so strong and positive,"" he would say via a speech recognition tool which used recorded samples of his voice.. He joined others including former rugby union player Doddie Weir and footballer Stephen Darby in raising awareness and was brutally honest about the effects of the condition.. ""I'm a prisoner in my own body,"" Burrow said. ""The lights are on, but no-one's home. I think like you, but my mind doesn't work right. I can't move my body."". This video can not be played. Rob Burrow's mother Irene with her son - from Rob Burrow: Living with MND. Burrow, together with family and friends, wanted to raise funds and awareness around a disease which affects around 5,000 people in the UK.. ""It's like a game in a way. We are here to try to beat MND and the only way we are going to win is by collective effort,"" said Weir, who died in November 2022.. Despite his illness, Burrow remained relentlessly positive.. ""Whenever you're around Rob, there's love, there's laughter, there's jokes, usually at my expense or some other big bloke,"" said former team-mate Barrie McDermott.. ""What he lacked in size, he more than made up for in his wit and sharpness."". Lindsey would help him into a swimming pool. It was the only way he could walk without suffering debilitating pain in his joints.. Burrow would joke: ""I know when you get married you say, 'in sickness and in health'. I did not think she signed up to look after me so soon."". Kevin Sinfield (right) has raised millions of pounds for motor neurone disease since his former Leeds team-mate's diagnosis. An appeal was launched to raise ��5m to build a Rob Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease in Leeds.. One of the prominent fundraisers was Kevin Sinfield, Leeds captain for the bulk of Burrow's playing career. They met when Burrow was 12 and a heartwarming friendship was formed.. When Sinfield ran seven marathons in seven days in December 2020, there was a poignant moment when he spied Burrow and family. The deep bond was clea""To see what he's had to go through has been really difficult. Rob was a champion on the field and an incredible friend,"" said Sinfield.. As a child, Burrow was told he was too small to make it as a player. It turned out his impact was bigger than anyone could have imagined.. ""I have a disease with no cure but I have too many reasons to live,"" he said of his life-limiting illness. ""I am not giving in until my last breath."". In December 2019, he was told he may have a year to live, two at most. He defied all the expectations.. This video can not be played. Burrow scores sensational try against St Helens.

bbc.com,Can South Africa's ANC reinvent itself after dismal election result?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpeel805l49o,2024-06-02 11:13,"Mavuso Msimang read the writing on the wall last year and now the people of South Africa have confirmed what he saw.. The veteran of the African National Congress (ANC) resigned from the party in December after 66 years, citing endemic corruption, and warning that the ANC was on the ���verge of losing power���.. The party has lost the position of unrivalled political power it���s held since the end of apartheid 30 years ago, with a sharp drop in support.. As South Africans digest a pivotal moment in their history, they are looking back at what this means for the former liberation movement, and forward to what it means for the future of the country.. ���I think all of us can agree it's about time we have change,��� says Lerato Setsiba, a computer science student at Johannesburg���s University of Witwatersrand.. ���But I think a majority of the people at the moment, we���re quite scared��� we don't know what's going to happen.���. Mr Msimang���s er ��� a life-size painting of Nelson Mandela, a coffee-table book bearing his name.. Mr Msimang served in the ANC���s armed wing uMkhonto weSizwe in the 1960s and was appointed to several government positions after the 1994 elections that brought the movement to power.. He���s now the deputy president of the ANC veterans league, which has strongly advocated for action against corruption in the party���s ranks.. ���There was always a tendency to not deal with issues of accountability,��� he says, but the economic mismanagement that resulted ���affected people very directly���.. ���When I saw those long queues [of voters] which are almost similar to what happened in 1994, I didn't think that they were queuing to celebrate the ANC. It became very clear to me that something bad is coming.���. ���I���m very disappointed,��� he told me. ���I don���t know how the ANC���s legacy will be retrieved. I hope this is not forevtion legacy��� - the ANC���s leading role in overthrowing white-minority rule.. They also remember its progressive social welfare policies that lifted millions of black families into the middle-class and expanded basic services such as water, electricity and welfare to millions more.. But the party began to attract people interested in power and political patronage. . Its downfall really began under former President Jacob Zuma, who resigned in disgrace amid allegations he���d allowed business associates to infiltrate government ministries. He denies the allegations.. Mr Zuma was replaced by Cyril Ramaphosa, who has been accused of not taking strong enough action to root out corruption from the party.. Nevertheless Mr Msimang, has not given up on the ANC, which his veteran comrades convinced him to rejoin.. ���I don't think all is lost. There is time for the ANC to regroup,��� says Mr Msimang.. ���But the renewal of the ANC would take the form of making sure that elements whm the organization. We���ve really failed to act decisively to do that - we have not heeded the pleas of the people.���. Nevertheless, Mr Msimang is worried about the absence of a strong alternative to the party: ���There is this fragmentation, which is going to leave the country very unstable if this persists.���. At the elections results centre near Johannesburg the numbers tick up on a dashboard tracking the vote-count. . Its giant screen towers over a hall crowded with journalists, party officials and analysts such as Susan Booysen. She found a quiet place to speak with me.. The topic is coalition politics, which South Africa has not had at the national level for two decades. Though the ANC is still by far the largest party, it will need to share power in order to continue governing.. The political landscape is tricky, and fraught with consequences because the major parties have different visions for the country.. The pro-business Democratic Alliance is not an easy fit because of id its reputation as a party for the white community and other minority groups.. The next two biggest parties are on the radical left. Mr Zuma's new uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) - a name it adopted from the ANC's military wing - and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). They talk about seizing white-owned land and nationalizing mines and banks.. The ANC regards the EFF as ���too erratic in its orientation, too in your face, and too unreasonable in its policy demands,��� says Ms Booysen.. And there���s too much ���bad blood��� between the ANC and MK, which has said it won���t partner with the ANC as long as Mr Ramaphosa remains its leader.. Unseating Mr Ramaphosa is ���the MK party's main objective at this stage, and the ANC is collateral damage in that process as far as they are concerned,��� she says.. Mr Zuma���s comeback, despite presiding over a decade of rampant corruption, has thrown a wildcard into the mix. He swept into the convention centre on Saturday nigme of what���s expected to be turbulent coalition talks could decide between two very different directions for South Africa.. On the campus of Wits University, a troupe of student actors is performing a pop-up parody of the election.. People turned out in large numbers to vote here - many of them, like medical student Nobuhle Khumalo, for the first time.. She���s excited about change but doesn���t know what it means: ���We���re just going to see what it looks like as it unfolds.���. We���re chatting on the grounds in front of the library with two of her friends, Mr Setsiba and music student Silka Graetz.. They hope a coalition government will bring more accountability and transparency, but are wary it might result in greater political instability and dysfunction.. ���I think the increase of votes with other parties definitely creates a healthy competition,��� says Ms Graetz.  . ���And I think with healthy competition comes better service, just an imp of whom did not experience apartheid, were more willing than their parents to abandon the ANC, powered by concerns about their future. . Some 45% of South Africa���s youth are unemployed, the highest recorded rate in the world.. ���When it���s campaign time you���re not speaking to issues that concern young people,��� says Mr Setsiba, criticizing government budget cuts to education in recent years. . ���Pour funds into universities, stimulate entrepreneurship, and make it a thriving country for new businesses!���. Ms Graetz warns that it will be important to restore investor confidence in the country in order to improve the economy.. Both she and Mr Setsiba are preparing to graduate, so launching into the job market is at the top of their minds.. Ms Graetz is acutely aware that her future will be formed in the next four or five years, the time period before the next election.. ���The one question I have is: 'How long we have to wait to see something [change]?'pude shift. How much longer until that's put into action?���. It took 30 years for the ANC to be held to account for its failures. South Africa���s younger generation is not prepared to wait that long.. . President Ramaphosa says the result was a victory for democracy, but the ANC lost its majority for the first time.  . The full schedule, including start time and venues, and results for the Men's T20 World Cup 2024. . Ivory Coast's Aboudia beat the likes of Damian Hirst to the top spot of a best-sellers list.. Students are seeing savings eroded by a Nigerian currency crisis, leaving them unable to pay fees.. The T20 World Cup is more than cricket's attempt to crack America, it is also the game finally opening its doors to the whole planet, says Stephan Shemilt.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,Mexicans vote in election likely to see first woman president,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4475gwny1o,2024-06-02 20:19,"Mexicans are voting in an election which is almost certain to see the country's first female president elected. . Both the front runner, Claudia Sheinbaum, and her main rival, X��chitl G��lvez, are far ahead in the polls of the only male candidate, Jorge ��lvarez M��ynez.. Voters will also elect all members of Mexico's Congress and governors in eight states, as well as the head of Mexico City's government.. The campaign has been overshadowed by violent attacks, which the government says have resulted in more than 20 local candidates being killed across Mexico, although private surveys put the total at 37.. Two people were reported killed in two attacks on polling stations in the state of Puebla on Sunday, officials said.. Ms Sheinbaum, a 61-year-old scientist who served as mayor of Mexico City from 2018 to 2023, has the backing of the outgoing president, Andr��s Manuel L��pez Obrador.. Mr L��pez Obrador, who has been in power since 2018, cannot run for the top office again, as undesidents are limited to a single six-year-term.. The popular leader - recent polls suggested he had an approval rate of close to 60% - has instead thrown his weight behind Ms Sheinbaum, who is part of his Morena party.. While many of the promises President L��pez Obrador made upon taking office have remained unfulfilled, his efforts to reduce poverty and help elderly Mexicans have been popular with beneficiaries of these social programmes. . Having the backing of the president may have considerably widened Ms Sheinbaum's base of voters, but it has also raised questions about how independent she is of the sometimes overpowering leader.. Ms Sheinbaum has stressed that she is very much her own woman, while at the same time promising to continue building on what she says are Mr L��pez Obrador's many achievements. . Their party, Morena, boasts about how millions of Mexicans have been lifted out of poverty during the past six years. . Morena says the number of people living in poverty is dwindling thanks to cies, such as more than doubling the minimum wage. . But economists have pointed out that there are also other factors at play, such as a rise in remittances being sent by Mexicans living abroad to their friends and family at home. . Taking on Ms Sheinbaum at the polls is senator and businesswoman X��chitl G��lvez.. Ms G��lvez, 61, was chosen by a broad coalition of parties who share a desire to put an end to the rule of the Morena party.. She and the Strength and Heart for Mexico coalition she is running for have been critical of the rise in violence the country has experienced in the run-up to the election.. Speaking at her closing rally, she told Mexicans that if they voted for her they""the bravest president, a president who does confront crime"".. And while she has repeatedly derided the strategy Mr L��pez Obrador laid out at the start of his presidency, when he promi""hugs not bullets"" in the battle against crime, Ms G��lvez has provided little detail as to how she would combat the powerful criminal groups which are behind much of the violence which is blighting the country. . She has said that she would offer better pay to the police and invest more in security in general. . But what has arguably made her more popular with voters critical of the outgoing president is her promise to strengthen institutions she says Mr L��pez Obrador tried to weaken, such as the constitutional court and the National Electoral Institute.. Ms G��lvez has accused Mr L��pez Obrador of being authoritarian and of undermining Mexico's democratic institutions, calling""arrogant and overbearing"".. Polls close at 01:00 BST (18:00 local time) and the winning candidate will take office at the end of September.. . A video posted on social media claims to show Jon Benjamin aiming a weapon at another man, while looking down the rifle's sight.. Who is elected as Mexico's next president on Sunday will have repercussions on US-Mexico relations.. Polls show that immigration is a primary electoral concern for many voters ahead of the 2024 election. .

bbc.com,Young French leader's rise and Belgium's future existence: What to watch in EU elections,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0wwepv5l6xo,2024-06-01 23:31,"When Europeans vote in elections for the European Parliament this coming week, their choices will reflect the national mood in 27 different countries.. Right and far-right parties are set to make gains, but the picture is widely different across the continent. Here is a snapshot of what to expect from BBC correspondents ahead of the vote.. Hugh Schofield in Paris. The main point of suspense in France is how big will be the victory of the far right under its 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella.. President Macron is certain to take a thumping. The question is whether his Renaissance party can limit the damage by at least retaining second place.   . It is far from a given, with the Socialists under a strongly performing Rapha��l Glucksmann snapping at the heels of Macron���s little-known champion Val��rie Hayer. In the polls, they are each at about 15% or thereabouts, while other parties are hovering a little above the 5% cut-off, below which they will return no MEPs at all.. Meanwhile, Jordan Bardeal Rally are consistently polling at 32% plus -  more than double their nearest rivals.. The far right also won the last European elections in France in 2019, but by only a tiny lead over President Macron���s party.. This time it looks like being a crushing victory. Clearly many voters who want to give a kicking to the president think that the most effective way is to choose the far right. Any inhibitions that might have checked that vote in the past have all but vanished.. Bruno Boelpaep in Brussels. Most Belgians have no idea whether the election posters are after their vote at a European, federal or regional level. Because on 9 June, Belgians are electing MPs for seven different parliaments.. Only one vote has got the country talking. And it's not the European election but the federal vote, because the future of Belgium might well be at stake in Flanders, the Flemish north. . To be able to govern and choose a prime minister, Flemish and French-speaking parties will have to form a coalition at the fedevel.. However, all the polls indicate that far-right party Vlaams Belang will come first. It wants the independence of Flanders and therefore the end of Belgium.. Until now, the traditional parties have kept a pact to keep it out of the ruling coalition. But as the prospect rises of Vlaams Belang coming first, so does the pressure on the other parties to let them have a seat at the table.. Adam Easton in Warsaw. Polling suggests Russia���s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine is the issue over the last decade that has most changed the way Poles see the future.. That may explain why Poland���s centrist, pro-EU prime minister Donald Tusk has made national security and Russia���s threat the number one issue in his election campaign.. He���s trying to break a run that���s seen the Eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party win the last nine elections, including October���s parliamentary and April���s local elections, although PiS���s lack of coalition partners saw it lose parties are keen to get their core voters out. . For PiS, that means playing on fears of abandoning the Polish zloty for the euro, rising energy prices and the impact of the EU���s climate policies on farmers. . Opinion polls put Donald Tusk���s Civic Coalition and PiS way out in front, tied on around 30% each.. Rob Cameron in Prague. Slovaks vote next Saturday amid a strange, muted and at times tense atmosphere that has descended on their country since the assassination attempt on Prime Minister Robert Fico.. The centre-right opposition immediately suspended campaigning after the 15 May  shooting, when Mr Fico went to greet supporters in the town of Handlova. He has only recently left hospital.. His left-populist Smer party is now leading the opinion polls following the shooting, which authorities say was politically motivated.. Smer opposes sending weapons to Ukraine and instead styles itself as the ���peace��� party.. It has eclipsed the centre-right opposition Progressive Slovakiamecka was previously a deputy chairman of the European Parliament.. Last year���s election campaign was marred by insults, threats and even a punch-up between ex-prime minister Igor Matovic and Mr Fico���s deputy Robert Kalinak, who is now de facto acting prime minister.. Politicians on all sides are now under pressure to keep the temperature lower.. Bethany Bell in Vienna. ���Stop EU Chaos, Asylum Crisis, Climate Terror, War-mongering, Corona Chaos,��� declares one poster for the far-right opposition Freedom Party (FP��), who lead the polls here.. Another image shows the head of the European Commission embracing the Ukrainian president. The governing conservative People���s Party (��VP) has condemned the image as Russian propaganda.. Political analyst Thomas Hofer says in the past the Eurosceptic FP�� has had trouble mobilising its supporters for EU elections. But now 27% of Austrians say they will vote for the party, ahead of the People's Party and the opposition So%.. The Green Party is struggling, after questions arose about its lead candidate, Lena Schilling, a 23-year-old climate activist. She was accused of spreading damaging rumours and being disloyal to the Greens, which she denies.. With Austria's general election this autumn, this vote is being watched very carefully.. By Laura Gozzi. At the last European elections, Matteo Salvini���s League came out top with over 34% of the vote. Giorgia Meloni���s Brothers of Italy (FdI) hovered around 6%.. The situation is now about to be reversed. FdI is set to win 27% of the vote ��� largely at the expense of the League, which will tumble down to just over 8%.. It is a remarkable result for Ms Meloni, who in the space of five years has gone from being a noisy but relatively minor opposition figure to prime minister and leader of Italy���s ruling coalition ��� in which the League is a junior partner.. While Mr Salvini seems condemned to espousing increasingly radical positions in an attempt to Meloni finds herself in the enviable position of being courted by French National Rally leader Marine Le Pen and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, both of whom want her support on the European stage.. Ms Meloni has already reshaped Italy. She might now get the chance to do the same to the EU.. Damien McGuinness in Berlin. Frieden, or peace, is the word most often cropping up on campaign posters here. For radical, left-wing parties that means a halt to arming Ukraine.. But for Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is presenting himself as ���peace chancellor���, it���s about calming voters��� fears of escalation. . His government is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine in Europe, but he has repeatedly set red lines on some weapons, tapping into his centre-left SPD party���s anti-war heritage.. ���Warmonger��� is the graffiti scrawled on his face on some posters. ���Ditherer��� is the accusation from some critics in parliament and the media.. His party, like all three governing coalition parties, is set to get fewer votes than last time. . The conservative opposition leads the polls, and the big question is whether the far-right AfD, despite a string of recent scandals, will beat Mr Scholz���s SPD into second place.. Nick Thorpe in Budapest. Hungarian leader Viktor Orban���s Fidesz party hoped to romp home with an easy victory, then help reshuffle Europe���s right wing.. Pushed out of the EU���s centre-right European Peoples Party, Fidesz wants a new group with Italy���s Giorgia Meloni and France���s Marine Le Pen that would be ���a force for Europe���.. Mr Orban���s plans have been dented but not destroyed by the emergence of former Fidesz insider Peter Magyar and his new TISZA party.. Peter Magyar has been touring the country, drawing large crowds and striking a deep chord with tirades against Fidesz corruption, the disastrous state of schools and hospitals, constant emigration, and growing queeze the Fidesz vote now then defeat Mr Orban in the next national election in 2026. Fidesz is on 44% and falling; TISZA is on 26% and still rising. . The Hungarian PM says EU leaders and the US are warmongers over Ukraine ��� and 9 June is a simple vote between peace and war.. Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid. The conservative People���s Party (PP) looks likely to make the most gains, as it takes votes from the struggling Ciudadanos, which could lose all eight of its seats.. For PP leader Alberto N����ez Feij��o, this is an opportunity to pile the pressure on Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S��nchez, whose government he is seeking to portray as corrupt ��� because of a judicial investigation into his wife, Bego��a G��mez ��� and in hock to Catalan nationalists.. Mr S��nchez hopes recent foreign policy set-pieces, such as the announcement of a large military package for Ukraine and his government���s recognition of a Palestinian state, will help ensure a reason surrounding Spain���s territorial issue and with the government���s controversial amnesty for Catalan nationalists hogging the headlines recently, polls suggest it is going to make gains.. A new far-right party, Se Acab�� la Fiesta (The Party���s Over) led by online agitator Alvise P��rez, could secure a seat.. Anna Holligan in The Hague. Billboards along canals and bike lanes display a patchwork of candidates. A record 20 parties are taking part, but many here are tired of politics and turnout is likely to be low.. The Netherlands is still reeling from the twists and turns in forming a new government after November's parliamentary elections.. The issues of that vote haven't gone away: immigration, a nationwide housing shortage, climate change and the future of farming.. Geert Wilders��� far-right Freedom Party (PVV) won the 2023 election and has  dropped a longstanding pledge to hold a ���Nexit��� vote, recognising there is limited appetite for a Dutch Brexit.. The that are set to form the next Dutch government ��� the liberal conservative VVD, the centrist New Social Contact and the Farmer Citizen Movement (BBB)) ���  will almost half the 31 Dutch seats in the European Parliament.. In a politically polarised society, it's the Eurosceptic right and pro-EU left that are poised to make the greatest gains.. Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen.

bbc.com,'Darkest period of my life': Gay conversion therapy in Italy,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2995x14r85o,2024-06-01 23:04,"Rosario Lonegro was only 20 years old when he entered a Catholic seminary in Sicily as an aspiring priest preparing to be ordained. But while he was there he fell in love with another man and his superiors demanded that he undergo conversion therapy intended to erase his sexual preferences if he wanted to continue on the path to the priesthood.. ���It was the darkest period of my"" he told the BBC, recalling his seminary experience in 2017. . Haunted by guilt and fears of committing a sin in the eyes of the Catholic Church, Rosario said he ""felt trapped with no choice but to suppress my true self���.. ���The psychological pressure to be someone I was not was insurmountable. I could not change no matter how hard I tried.���. For more than a year, he was compelled to take part in spiritual gatherings outside the seminary, some over several days, where he was subjected to a series of distressing activities intended to strip him of his sexual proclivities. . These included being locked in a dark closet, being coerced to strip naked in front of fellow participants, and even being required to enact his own funeral. . During these rituals, he was tasked with committing to paper his perceived flaws, such as ���homosexuality���, ���abomination���, ���falsehood��� - and even more explicit terms, which he was then obliged to bury beneath a symbolic gravestone.. The World Health Organization (WHO) removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1990. Subsequent scientific research has largely re not only ineffective but also harmful.. In France, Germany and predominantly Catholic Spain, conversion therapies have been officially banned, and efforts are under way both in England and Wales to outlaw such practices.. Today in Italy, it's nearly impossible to determine the precise extent of these practices, reported mostly by men, but some women too, and there is no standard legal definition of them.. In recent months, however, the BBC has conducted interviews with several young gay men across the country who have shared their experiences of being subjected to pseudoscientific group meetings or individual therapy sessions aimed at turning them into heterosexuals.. One 33-year-old man who attended this type of meeting for over two years expressed his initial motivation, saying: ���I wanted to reconcile with myself. I didn���t want to be homosexual. I thought I needed to be cured.���. ���I saw that as my sole path to acceptance,��� said another. He was not trying to become ag acceptance in his daily life.. Gay conversion therapy is not limited to one specific region of Italy - group meetings and individual therapy sessions run across the country, some even run by licensed psychotherapists. In some cases, these gatherings and therapy sessions are unofficial and covert, often promoted through discreet conversations and secret referrals.. Other courses are publicly advertised, with known figures within Italy���s conservative circles actively seeking followers online and on social media platforms to promote their ability to change sexual orientations.. In Sicily, Rosario Lonegro was primarily subjected to meetings organised by the Spanish group Verdad y Libertad (Truth and Freedom), under the leadership of Miguel ��ngel S��nchez Cord��n. This group has since disbanded, having incurred the disapproval of the Catholic Church.. However, the Italian priest who originally pushed Lonegro into these practices was given a senior position within the Church, while others conpiration from S��nchez Cord��n���s methods in Italy.. Many of the people the BBC spoke to were referred to Luca di Tolve, a ���moral/spiritual trainer��� who gained recognitio""I was gay once. In Medjugorie I found myself"".. On his website, Di Tolve and his wife boast that they are a ""contented couple"" seeking to ""aid anyone whose sexual identity is in turmoil, helping them to genuinely exercise their freedom in determining who they wish to be as a person���. When contacted by the BBC, Di Tolve did not respond.. Another active individual promoting ways to tackle perceived sexual orientation is Giorgio Ponte, a well-known writer in Italy���s ultra-conservative circles. He says he wants to help people overcome their homosexuality and be liberated, by telling his own story as a man with homosexual drives who is on his ���potentially life-long��""In my experience, homosexual attraction stems from an injury to one's identity that conceals needs unrelated to the sexual-erotic aspect but rather tied to a distorted perception of oneself, reflecting across all aspects of life,"" he told the BBC.. ""I believe that a homosexual person should have the freedom to try [to become heterosexual], if they want, knowing, however, that it may not be possible for everyone,"" he added.. In recent years, dozens of young men and women have sought guidance from the likes of Di Tolve, Ponte and S��nchez Cord��n. Among them is 36-year-old Massimiliano Felicetti, a gay man who grappled with attempts to change his sexual orientation for more than 15 years. . ���I started to be uncomfortable with myself from a very early age, I felt I would never be accepted by my family, society, Church circles. I thought I was wrong, I just wanted to be loved, and these people of"" he said.. Felicetti said he had tried different solutions, consulting psychologists and clergy members who offered to help him become heterosexual. However, about two years ago, he decided to stop. A friar who knew of his struggle encouraged him to start dating a woman, but it didn���t feel natural.. ���When I kissed her for the first time, it felt unnatural. It was time to stop pretending,��� Felicetti said.. Only a few months ago he came out as gay to his family. ���It took years, but for the first time I am happy to be who I am.���. Despite attempts from previous governments to promote a bill to oppose conversion therapies, no progress has been made in Italy. Italy���s right-wing government led by Giorgia Meloni has so far adopted a hostile stance toward LGBT rights, with the prime minister herself vowing to tackle the so-called ���LGBT lobby��� and ���gender ideology���.. Such lack of progress comes as no surprise to Michele Di Bari, a researche says that Italy is structurally much slower to implement change compared with other countries in Western Europe.. ���This is a very elusive phenomenon, given that it is a practice prohibited by Italy���s order of psychologists itself. Yet, in the Italian legal system, it is not deemed illegal. People carrying out such practices can���t be punished.���. Despite the complexity of the issue, experts believe that partly due to Italy���s strong Catholic influence, the country has been more hesitant to prohibit these controversial practices.. ���This may be one of the elements that, along with a strongly patriarchal and male chauvinist culture, makes the broader understanding of homosexuality and LGBT rights more difficult,��� said Valentina Gentile, a sociologist at Rome���s LUISS University.. ���However, it is also fair to say that not all Catholicism is hostile to the inclusion of diversity and the Church itself is in a period of strong transformation in thie Catholic Church is open to everyone, including the gay community, and that it has a duty to accompany them on a personal path of spirituality, but within the framework of its rules.. However, the Pope himself was reported to have used a highly derogatory term towards the LGBT community when he told a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops that gay people should not be allowed to become priests. The Vatican issued an official apology.. Rosario Lonegro has left Sicily behind and also lives in Milan. Following a nervous breakdown in 2018, he left both the seminary and the conversion therapy group.. While he still believes in God, he no longer wants to become a priest. He shares an apartment with his boyfriend, he studies philosophy and undertakes occasional freelance work to pay for university. However, the psychological wounds inflicted by such activities still run deep.. ���During those meetings, one mantra haunted me and was repeated over and over: ���God didn���t make me that way. God dmosexual. It���s only a lie I tell myself,��� I thought I was evil,��� he said. . ���I will never forget that.���.

bbc.com,Shops rush for Christmas stock as shipping costs surge,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqee78djzmro,2024-06-02 00:45,"European retailers are rushing to place their Christmas orders early as soaring shipping costs and trade route disruption threaten holiday deliveries, experts say.. For the last few months, vessels belonging to Western firms have been attacked in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels backing Hamas in its war with Israel, driving shipping prices up.. Container prices, which peaked in January and briefly declined, have rebounded sharply in recent weeks.. One business told the BBC that increased costs were likely to feed through to the price of big-ticket items such as white goods.. Nick Glynn, boss of the Buy It Direct group, owns several online retailers including Appliances Direct and Laptops Direct, which are having to plan and book well in advance to make sure their shipments arrive on time.. Because they are planning ahead, he said he didn't think Black Friday and Christmas stock would be affected.. But he said: ""It impacts cash and warehouse space as suddenly you have to store the goods for longer. You can't risk ordering later."". Mr Glynn explained that the spot rate - the current price for immediate delivery of goods - has dramatically increased in recent weeks from $4,500 to $7,500 (��3,500 to ��5""This makes a massive impact on big bulky items, especially those that have low margins such as furniture, barbecues, and kitchen appliances,"" he said.. There was ""no way"" most online retailers could absorb those price increases on big-ticket items, he said.. ""So unfortunately for consumers, the next few months will see significant rises on these big-ticket items,"" he added.. Disruptions caused by Yemen's Houthi movement have limited the global supply of shipping space and containers.. The Houthi rebels have already launched attacks on more than 50 ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.. Shipping costs have soared as a result. The average cost of shipping a 40ft container now exceeds $4,000, a 140% increase from 2023, according to freight market tracker Xeneta.. Peter Sand, Xeneta's chief analyst, said that importers have learned many lessons from the pandemic including that ""the most straightforward way to protect supply chains is to ship as many of your goods as you can as quickly as possible"".. ""That is what we are seeing with some businesses telling us they are already shipping cargo for the Christmas period - in May,"" he said.. Typically, retailers start importing goods for the November Black Friday sales and Christmas shopping season between late summer and autumn.. Sue Terpilowski, from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, agreed, saying companies are realising that disruption to the Red Sea route caused by Houthi attacks could last until the autumn.. ""To avoid headlines 'Christmas is cancelled, there's nothing in the shops', people are now actually bringing forward their shipments,"" she said. ""So they'll be here in good time allowing any eventualities that might happen while they are at sea."". The attacks on ships have forced owners of vessels travelling between Asia and Europe to take a longer route around Africa, and so ships are starting their journeys earlier to allow for the extra time needed for the diversion.. ""The effects of the diversions from the Red Sea that started last December are only now becoming apparent, with vessels on the Asia-Europe trade needing more than 100 days on a rotation by circumventing Africa,"" said Dominique Nadelhofer, from Kuehne + Nagel, a major sea logistics firm.. He added that the rotation of container equipment has also been disrupted, and said only around 50% of global container shipping is currently completed on time.. As well as concerns about potential future Houthi attacks, there are also growing fears that as naval forces focus on countering the Houthi rebels, the resulting reduction in maritime patrols elsewhere may provide Somali pirates with opportunities to increase their activities.. Cheltenham's Cavendish House, which closed in April, is providing a temporary home to local traders.. Abercrombie & Fitch is enjoying its strongest growth streak in more than a decade..

bbc.com,Will using Western weapons on Russia help Ukraine change the war?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjll1r1el5wo,2024-06-01 21:04,"Ukraine is now allowed to use Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia. What will this decision change and how will it affect the front line in Ukraine?. Up until now, Western countries restricted the use of their weapons to military targets located inside Ukraine, including Crimea and occupied territories. They were concerned that attacking targets across the internationally recognised border with weapons provided by Nato countries would escalate the conflict.. But the latest Russian advance in the north-eastern Kharkiv region convinced Kyiv���s allies that in order to defend itself, Ukraine must be able to destroy military targets on the other side of the border as well.. Last month, Russia launched a massive ground assault in the region, opening a new front and capturing several villages. The Russian advance posed a serious threat to Kharkiv, Ukraine���s second-largest city, which is just 30km away from the border.. The border in this region is effectively the front line as well, so the banstern weapons to hit targets beyond Ukraine enabled Russian troops to prepare for that operation in a safe environment.. Following the growing pressure from Ukraine and other European states, the US agreed to change its policy and allow Kyiv to strike Russia with Western weapons.. ���The hallmark of our engagement has been to adapt and adjust as necessary, to meet what���s actually going on on the battlefield, to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, when it needs it,��� US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Prague on Friday.. Just a few days before this announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to expand ���sanitary zones��� in case Western long-range weapons are used to strike the Russian territory. . He said that Nato countries in Europe must remember that they have ���states with small territories and dense population���. . ���They must take this factor into consideration prior to discussi he added.. Avoiding an escalation is probably the reason why the US didn���t include long-range weapons such as ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) in its permission to strike Russia. These missiles have a range of 300km and could be used to hit military bases and airfields well into Russian territory.. Such limitations leave Ukraine with only the option of focusing on targets near its border.  But this is still a major policy shift by Kyiv���s main allies.. Even with a shorter range - up to 70km - multiple rocket launchers such as HIMARS can significantly disrupt Russian logistics operations and troops movement, which will ultimately slow down any offensive plans.. Now, Ukraine can ���strike places where the enemy concentrated its troops, equipment and supply storage facilities that are used to attack Ukraine,��� says Yuriy Povkh from the Kharkiv tactical group that co-ordinates military operations in the north-east.. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stateing its troops just 90km from Kharkiv for another offensive.  . And the Institute for Study of War analysed satellite images and confirmed that there were ���expanded activities at depots and warehouses��� in that area.  So the ability to target those facilities will seriously strengthen the capacity of Ukrainian forces to repel new attacks in the region.. Lifting the ban on Western weapons, however, is unlikely to help to protect Ukraine from Russian glide bombs known locally as KAB. They have a devastating effect and are regularly used to bomb Kharkiv and other border towns.  But to stop such attacks, Ukrainian forces must target planes that drop those deadly KABs.. The only weapon capable of intercepting those planes that Ukraine has at its disposal at this moment is the US air-defence system Patriot.  However, getting this weapon close to Kharkiv is a huge risk.  Spy drones can quickly spot it and Moscow can launch missiles such as Iskander to destroy this expensive system.. Interestingly, thece, which provide Ukraine with jointly made Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles (or Scalp as they are called in France), haven���t explicitly restricted their use.  And their range can go up to 250km. In fact, French President Emanuel Macron told journalists last week:���We should allow [Ukraine] to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked.���. And such rhetoric is seen as permission to use Storm Shadows/Scalps, a military aviation officer who prefers to remain anonymous, told the BBC.  So, he says, Ukraine can now hit airfields in the Kursk and Belgorod regions that border Ukraine.. However, such operations will be limited in terms of what they can achieve. Ukrainian Su-24s that are equipped with these cruise missiles will have to get close to the Russian border in order to launch them, which makes them vulnerable to Russian air defence systems. F-16 jets that are expected by the end of this year d for such tasks.  But President Zelensky admits that it���s still not clear whether Ukraine���s partners will allow these jets to be used to attack targets in Russia.. ���I think that using any weapon, Western kind of weapon, on the territory of Russia is a question of time,��� he said at the Nordic summit in Stockholm on Friday.. Ukrainian forces are trying to develop their own weapons to hit targets in Russia���s rear.  Some of their drones have attacked oil depots and military facilities hundreds of kilometres away from the border.  . The latest attack was on a long-range radar station in the city of Orsk, which is 1800km from the Ukrainian border.. Both countries are trying to dissuade others from attending the upcoming event, Ukraine's president says.. Estonia is pouring money and weapons into Ukraine���s war effort to try to push back the Russians.""provoking a new level of tension"" over the use of Western-supplied weapons.. The US president gives Ukraine permission to use US-supplied weapons to strike targets in Russia, but only near Kharkiv. . Several Western allies have signalled they are open to Ukraine using their weapons against Russia.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

He starred as Alan Bates in the ITV show Mr Bates vs the Post Office, which tells the story of hundreds of sub-postmasters who were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting.. Many of the reported losses in branch accounts which led to prosecutions were actually caused by faults in Horizon - the Post Office's computer system.. Jones, speaking at the Hay Festival, said Bates - a former sub-postmaster himself, who led the victims' campaign to get justice - ""doesn't want any honours until he's finished the job"".. ""I get to play a hero. Really, someone who I think of as a hero. Someone in the culture who just doesn't seem to be subject to the same forces that we all are,"" the 57-year-old said.. ""He can't be bought. He's asked to open Glastonbury. 'No, thank you'. He's asked to do these things, he doesn't want to do any of that. He says, 'I've got work to do', which is to get that stuff done."". Jones added that the values that Bates had demonstrated, such as duty and following things through are ""unfashionable"" now, but he remembered ""being lectured about"" them when he was growing up.. The Post Office Horizon scandal has been called the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history.. The four-part series, which aired at the start of the year, renewed mass public interest in the plight of the victims like never before.. Last month, a bill quashing the convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters became law just before Parliament ended ahead of the general election.. Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells also recently faced three days of questions at the public inquiry into the scandal.. When reflecting on what exactly had made the show such a hit, Jones said there was ""a feeling of disempowerment"" in the country.. ""There's a feeling of outrage, justly, and the story is told very clearly, and it's by no means obvious,"" he said.. ""Computer software malfunction is not an obvious thing to make a drama about."". He also spoke about the victims of the scandal, describing them as having ""this extraordinary dignity, considering 20 years of living in a Hitchcockian nightmare.. ""They have this incredible humble modest humility."". The 93-year-old tied the knot with his new wife Elena Zhukova in a ceremony at his Californian vineyard..

bbc.com,Zelensky accuses Russia and China of undermining summit,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722q4dn7e1o,2024-06-02 10:42,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia and China of attempting to undermine his upcoming global peace summit in Switzerland.. He said Russia was trying to dissuade other states from attending the event, and that China was working to do this as well.. Speaking at an Asian security forum, he also said there were ���elements of Russia���s weaponry��� that come from China.. China says it does not side with either side of the Ukraine war, a position that has been increasingly questioned particularly by the US. . Beijing is accused of aiding Moscow by sending components for weapons. It is also seen as propping up the Russian economy by purchasing vast quantities of oil and gas, softening the impact of Western sanctions.. Mr Zelensky made a surprise appearance at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore attended by defence chiefs from around the world, including US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chinese defence minister Dong Jun.. The visit was aimed at drumming up support fro Besides meeting regional leaders, he also urged delegates to attend his summit due to be held later in June. . Mr Zelensky said it would focus on achieving nuclear security, food security, and the release of prisoners of war and Ukrainian children held in Russia.. So far 106 countries said they would send high-level representatives or their leaders to the summit, he said. . Russia has not been invited and China is not attending. . A formal invitation was not issued to Russia as Moscow had told Switzerland early on that it did not want to participate, the BBC understands.. Mr Zelensky claimed that Russia was attempting to disrupt the summit by pressuring countries not to attend, through threats of a blockade of agricultural goods, chemical goods, and energy.. Certain countries were assisting this ���diplomatic disruption���, he added.. He named China later on, and said it was ���working for countries to not come to the peace summit���, unlike the US which has promised to send a high-les encouraging others to attend.. Russia was doing ""everything to disrupt the peace summit"" by using ""Chinese influence on the region"" and diplomats to do so, he said.. ""It is unfortunate that such a big, independent, powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin."". China's foreign ministry had said that the conference ""should have the recognition of Russia and Ukraine"" and equal participation. ""Otherwise, it is difficult for the conference to play a substantive role in restoring peace,"" a spokeswoman said on Friday.. Mr Zelensky also said China's leader Xi Jinping had earlier promised him they would ���stand aside in this war and would not support Russia with weapons���.. But, he added, there are now ���elements that are part of Russia���s weaponry��� that come from China, according to various intelligence agencies. He called for China to maintain a ���consistent��� position.. The US has said that China is helping Russia make more munitions, armoured vehicles and missiles. It estimates about 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the microelectronics Russia imports come from China.. Earlier on Sunday, Chinese defence minister Dong Jun said they do not supply weapons to either party of the Ukra""strict controls"" on the exports of dual-use technology, which are items that can be used for civilian and military purposes.. ""We have never done anything to fan the flames. We stand firmly on the side of peace and dialogue,"" he said in his speech.. Mr Zelensky said he did not meet Mr Dong at the dialogue, but he did meet Mr Austin. The two discussed the US��� decision to let Ukraine use American weapons on Russian territory, according to Mr Zelensky. . That decision comes with certain restrictions. Asked by the BBC if he requested the removal of limitations, he said he was grateful to the US for allowing Ukraine to use the HIMARS artillery rocket system by the border of the Kharkiv region which has seen intense fighting.. ���Is that sufficient? No,��� he said, adding that there were airfields from which Russia was permanently firing ���knowing that Ukraine will not fire back���.. The US joins other Western states such as France in allowing Ukraine more leeway in using Western-supplied weapons. Russia has warned of ���serious consequences��� of this move.. This weekend marked the second time Mr Zelensky has visited Asia since the war began. He made a surprise appearance at the G7 leaderse Supplies of electricity have been cut off in several areas and schools ordered to remain shut..

bbc.com,Michael Ball thanks Steve Wright as he takes over late DJ's Sunday show,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cekkx5me3jko,2024-06-02 13:09,"Michael Ball has paid tribute to Steve Wright, calling his legacy ""immeasurable"", as he took over the the late DJ's Sunday Love Songs programme on BBC Radio 2.. Ball, a West End star who has presented on Radio 2 since 2008, was named as the show's new host after Wright died in February.. The 61-year-old said Wright was ""missed"", adding: ""He created Love Songs, and I am so, so proud to be carrying the baton for him into the future."". Wright joined the BBC in the 1970s, and went on to host shows on Radio 1 and Radio 2 for more than four decades. He also presented Top of the Pops on BBC One.. The death of the beloved presenter at the age of 69 led to an outpouring of tributes across the BBC and beyond.. Ball was among those paying tribute at the time, calling the news ""unbelievably sad and shocking"", and calling Wright ""an inspiration, a cheerleader and a lovely man"".. During the show - which is now called Love Songs with Michael Ball - the presenter revealed that the last song he played would be a tribute to Wright.. The final song on the weekly show is known as the ""last dance"". Ball said that this Sunday, it would be something ""very special"", and one of Wright's favourites.. ""So in memory of Steve, I want you to give someone a hug. Make that time for it now.. ""Your partner, your friend, (your) child, parent, even your pet.. ""And if you're on your own right now, I'm embracing you with a virtual hug.. ""And I want to take this opportunity to thank Steve, his legacy on Radio 2 is immeasurable."". He went on to play the song Wichita Lineman by Glen Campbell, a song Wright regularly used as background music for his show.. Ball said he hoped audiences would ""take a moment and maybe have a little dance along with me"".. Sunday Love Songs was a show that was dear to Wright's heart.. After his 15-year stint on Radio 1 ended, he worked in commercial radio for a short while but then joined Radio 2 as part of the weekend line-up and launched Sunday Love Songs in 1996.. He developed the format himself as a programme where he could read out listener emails and letters exactly as they were written.. When he was subsequently given the Radio 2 afternoon show - which he hosted for 23 years - he agreed a special deal that allowed him to also present Sunday Love Songs each week. And even when he was replaced by Scott Mills on the afternoon show in 2022, he again continued his Sunday stint until the day before his death.. Ball now hosts the show on Sundays from 09:00 to 11:00.. Ten finalists, including a choir and a magician, will compete in Sunday night's live final.. A seven-party debate is to be held on Friday, before a Question Time special and head-to-head event..

The former England captain said the pair met at the monarch's Highgrove home in Gloucestershire to discuss the work of the King's Foundation.. Beckham has now been made an ambassador of the charitable foundation to help promote its work.. He said he was ""excited"" to be taking on the role, adding: ""I'm particularly looking forward to supporting the foundation's education programmes and its efforts to ensure young people have greater access to nature."". Photographs released to mark the announcement show Beckham with the King on the doorstep of Highgrove.. He is also seen demonstrating his carpentry skills with foundation students at the Snowdon School of Furniture, which is part of The King's Foundation's..

bbc.com,Service held to mark 30 years since RAF Chinook disaster,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqqq0x69gego,2024-06-02 13:55,"A service has been held to remember the 29 people killed in an RAF Chinook helicopter crash on the 30th anniversary of the disaster.. The helicopter carrying leading security personnel crashed on the Mull of Kintyre peninsula on the west coast of Scotland on 2 June 1994.. The aircraft was on its way from RAF Aldergrove near Belfast to a security conference in Inverness when it crashed into a hillside in thick fog.. The incident was the worst RAF peacetime disaster and the reasons for the crash remain unclear.. Rev Roddy McNidder, who was the parish minister at the time of the crash, delivered the sermon at Southend Parish Church and described the 25 passengers and four crew who died as ""extraordinary people who were selflessly devoted to duty in the service of their country"".. During the service, he said: ""Our service this early afternoon continues our promise that we care.. ""This church is here for you and your families and loved ones, to remember, to honour their memory and their service.. ""To bring the gift of encouragement, sensitively and graciously, and to hold fast the standards and principles they represented."". The crash came just two months before the 1994 IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland.. Passengers on RAF Chinook ZD576 included leading security personnel from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), MI5 and the Army.. The pilots, flight lieutenants Jonathan Tapper and Richard Cook, were initially accused of gross negligence over the crash.. A Scottish fatal accident inquiry (FAI) concluded it was impossible to establish the exact cause of the crash and in 2011 the pilots were exonerated.. Families of those killed previously said they had been ���failed��� by the Ministry of Defence who did not organise a 30th anniversary memorial.. The MoD said it was a ��"" and said it does not fund new memorials.. A special act of remembrance is being held at a memorial cairn at the crash site on Sunday afternoon.. Mr McNidder added: """"Each name inscribed on this cairn and which shines out every time the sun reflects upon it, calls us to remember the unique person whose name is written there, and to acknowledge our memories, experiences and encounters with them, along with the hopes of what might have been over these 30 years, and years still to come."".

bbc.com,Mystery as doctor finds live goldfish in garden,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl448x6ly4jo,2024-06-02 14:21,"A junior doctor has ended up with a new pet after a goldfish mysteriously appeared in his garden. . Dr Ben Beska, 33, from Newcastle, said he saw a group of magpies squawking in his garden on Saturday and went out to investigate when he spotted the fish lying in the grass.. The NHS cardiology doctor retrieved the fish and placed it in a freezer drawer filled with water, and intends to keep it as a pet. . ""It's pretty mad really, finding a fish on the lawn. I have no idea how it got in the garden,"" Dr Beska said.. The fish has now been named Alice after a text message he sent to a friend regarding the animal autocorrected from ""it's alive"" to ""it's alice"".. Dr Beska said that once he spotted the fish moving on the grass he ""couldn't just leave it"".. He said he picked up the ""flapping"" fish and found an old freezer drawer which he filled with water.. ""It started to swim around so it was alive,"" he said.. ""I locked my cats out of the kitchen, obviously, I didn't want them to eat it, that would have been a terrible end to the story,"" Dr Beska added.. He went to a nearby shop and purchased a tank and some chemicals, adding: ""I think it was seconds from death so it's a lucky fish."". Dr Beska suspected a bird had picked up the fish from a nearby pond and dropped it while carrying it away.. However, he said, there were no ponds close by and he thought it must therefore have travelled a ""reasonable distance"".. The mystery of the goldfish has gone viral on X, formerly Twitter, with Dr Beska's initial post about it gaining more than 16 million views which he said was ""bonkers"".. He said: ""It's very odd, I mainly use [X] for medical stuff, so this is very, very different.. ""It's been quite funny, some of the comments are quite funny and about 1,000 people said they thought a bird dropped it."". One X user has even created a separate account for the fish, with the username alicebeska.. One post on the account for the fish reads: ""Such a wild day, booked one of those journeetrips and wound up in some northerner's lawn? I would like a refund please."". Dr Beska now intends to keep the fish as a pet, with plans to purchase a larger tank and possibly another fish to keep it company. .

bbc.com,Burrow was sporting great and inspiring MND campaigner,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/articles/crggwy1wp96o,2024-06-02 19:16,"This video can not be played. Rob Burrow was a Super League star before becoming an MND campaigner. A champion on and off the field, the determination, courage and humility of Rob Burrow guaranteed a legacy that stretches way beyond the sport he loved.. At 5ft 5in, Burrow was among the smallest men in rugby league, but he became one of its biggest names.. Father, family man, friend, competitor, campaigner. His death aged 41 comes nearly five years after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.. When Burrow learned of his illness, he told his wife Lindsey: ""Thank God it's me and not the kids."". His stoic resilience helped to transform the profile of this condition. His moving story was brought to millions by the BBC Breakfast team who became friends.. Decorated for his talents, Burrow played 492 times for Leeds Rhinos, won eight Grand Finals, three World Club Challenges and two Challenge Cups, as well as 15 England and five Great Britain caps.. Rugby league legend Burrow dies aged 41. Tributes paid to Rob Burrow following death at 41. A mural was painted on the side of Leeds Beckett University's Student Union to honour Rob Burrow. With his slight frame and diminutive stature, Burrow always stood out among the hulks of the modern rugby league game, from his junior days right through to the elite.. What he lacked in size, he made up for in devastating speed, evasiveness and skill, and he honed his tackling technique to enable him to compensate when it came to felling far bigger opponents.. One moment which best summed up his qualities was his try in Leeds' 2011 Grand Final win against St Helens, when having stepped off the bench at hooker, he ducked through the line and in full flight stepped his way past international full-back Paul Wellens to score a remarkable solo effort.. There was also the emotion of his final game in 2017, when he and long-time friend Danny McGuire - two members of Leeds' oft-referred 'golden generation' - bowed out together with Grand Final success at Old Trafford against Burrow's hometown club Castleford.. Rob Burrow (right) lifts the Super League trophy with Danny McGuire following Leeds' Grand Final win over Castleford in 2017 - their final game for the club. On Burrow's retirement that year, Leeds head coach Brian McDermott said: ""Rob will be remembered as one of the greats of our game, not just in the Super League era but throughout the history of the sport."". He initially continued to work in rugby league after hanging up the boots, helping to develop the next generation at Headingley with the club he loved.. It was his resolve and positive outlook after his career ended that brought this unique character to a wider audience.. Burrow revealed he had been diagnosed with MND in December of 2019. There is no cure.. He would gradually lose his ability to talk, to move, and to breathe easily.. ""It's heartbreaking,"" consultant neurologist Dr Agam Jung told a BBC documentary on Burrow.. ""You may not be able to speak, you may not be able to swallow, you may not be able to breathe independently, you have weakness in your arms and legs. This leads to dependency and a reduced life span."". This video can not be played. How Rob Burrow's life changed after his diagnosis - from Rob Burrow: Living with MND. Burrow married his childhood sweetheart Lindsey in 2006 and the couple had three children together.. ""He always says, 'find somebody else, you're still young',"" Lindsey said in the documentary, discussing the prospect of a future without her husband. ""There will never be anyone else. No-one can ever take Rob's place."". His parents, Geoff and Irene, would help to feed Burrow.. Alongside looking after children Macy, Maya and Jackson and working as a physio in the NHS, Lindsey was effectively his primary carer - her love shining through during the difficult days since his diagnosis.. ""Yes, it is sad, but it is a story full of love, hope and optimism,"" she said.. Burrow lost weight and could not kick a ball with his son or change a nappy, but he retained his spirit despite losing his independence.. A little smile. A defiant thumbs-up. ""My mind is so strong and positive,"" he would say via a speech recognition tool which used recorded samples of his voice.. He joined others including former rugby union player Doddie Weir and footballer Stephen Darby in raising awareness and was brutally honest about the effects of the condition.. ""I'm a prisoner in my own body,"" Burrow said. ""The lights are on, but no-one's home. I think like you, but my mind doesn't work right. I can't move my body."". This video can not be played. Rob Burrow's mother Irene with her son - from Rob Burrow: Living with MND. Burrow, together with family and friends, wanted to raise funds and awareness around a disease which affects around 5,000 people in the UK.. ""It's like a game in a way. We are here to try to beat MND and the only way we are going to win is by collective effort,"" said Weir, who died in November 2022.. Despite his illness, Burrow remained relentlessly positive.. ""Whenever you're around Rob, there's love, there's laughter, there's jokes, usually at my expense or some other big bloke,"" said former team-mate Barrie McDermott.. ""What he lacked in size, he more than made up for in his wit and sharpness."". Lindsey would help him into a swimming pool. It was the only way he could walk without suffering debilitating pain in his joints.. Burrow would joke: ""I know when you get married you say, 'in sickness and in health'. I did not think she signed up to look after me so soon."". Kevin Sinfield (right) has raised millions of pounds for motor neurone disease since his former Leeds team-mate's diagnosis. An appeal was launched to raise ��5m to build a Rob Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease in Leeds.. One of the prominent fundraisers was Kevin Sinfield, Leeds captain for the bulk of Burrow's playing career. They met when Burrow was 12 and a heartwarming friendship was formed.. When Sinfield ran seven marathons in seven days in December 2020, there was a poignant moment when he spied Burrow and family. The deep bond was clea""To see what he's had to go through has been really difficult. Rob was a champion on the field and an incredible friend,"" said Sinfield.. As a child, Burrow was told he was too small to make it as a player. It turned out his impact was bigger than anyone could have imagined.. ""I have a disease with no cure but I have too many reasons to live,"" he said of his life-limiting illness. ""I am not giving in until my last breath."". In December 2019, he was told he may have a year to live, two at most. He defied all the expectations.. This video can not be played. Burrow scores sensational try against St Helens.

That gave Saso, who switched her international allegiance from the Philippines in 2022, her second LPGA Tour title - both coming at the US Women's Open.. Saso became the first Filipino player to win a major when she clinched her first US Women's Open title as a teenager in 2021.. She was obliged to renounce one of her two citizenships before she turned 22 and chose to take Japanese citizenship.. Saso suffered an early blow on Sunday when she followed a birdie on the second by four-putting the sixth for a double bogey.. But after steadying the ship she stormed clear as only two players finished under par, with Minjee Lee limping home in 41 for an eight-over 78 while Meechai struggled to a closing 77.. Andrea Lee struggled to a 75 to share third place with fellow American Ally Ewing, who surged through the field with a 66.. Saso is the third player to win major championships with their first two LPGA Tour titles, after after Se Ri Pak and In Gee Chun.. 'Beacon of hope' - Sinfield's tribute to friend Burrow.

bbc.com,Muir & Reekie claim wins at Stockholm Diamond League,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cnllq42g5n2o,2024-06-02 19:20,"This video can not be played. Britain's Laura Muir wins women's 1500m at Stockholm Diamond League. Britons Laura Muir and Jemma Reekie both claimed victories at the Stockholm Diamond League, as Swedish pole vault star Armand Duplantis went close to setting another world record on home soil.. Olympic silver medallist Muir, 31, showed an impressive turn of speed as she burst clear in the final 200m to win the women's 1500m in three minutes 57.99 seconds.. ""To be running what I am now and knowing that I have a couple more months of training before the Olympics is very exciting going forward,"" said Muir, who began her outdoor season by running 3:56.35 for fourth place in Eugene last week.. ""It is all about August this year. That is when I need to be at my best."". While not an official Diamond League race - meaning no points were on offer as athletes look to qualify for September's final - Muir's fellow Scot Reekie, 26, controlled the women's 800m to win in 1:57.79.. Olympic and world champion Duplantis sought to break the men's pole vault world record for the ninth time as he was cheered on by his home crowd. . After claiming victory as the only athlete over 6.00m, the 24-year-old went agonisingly close but failed to go clear in three attempts at 6.25m.. British world bronze medallist Ben Pattison finished fourth in the men's 800m in a season's best 1:44.44. Elliot Giles was sixth in 1:45.10, while former 1500m world champion Jake Wightman clocked 1:45.35 for eighth as he continued his return to fitness following an injury-disrupted 2023.. Revee-Walcott-Nolan was sixth in the women's 1500m in a personal best 4:00.77.. Jamaica's world champion Shericka Jackson ran a season's best 22.69secs to win the women's 200m as Britain's Amy Hunt finished third in 22.92secs.. Elsewhere, Dutch world 400m hurdles champion Femke Bol posted her fastest ever season opener in 53.07 seconds.. The seventh stop of the Diamond League series in Stockholm marked the halfway stage in the road to the final in Brussels on 13-14 September.. Only three Diamond League meetings remain before the athletics programme begins at Paris 2024 in August, with Paris, Monaco and London each hosting crucial opportunities for athletes to finalise their preparations before the Olympic Games.. Lausanne, Silesia, Rome and Zurich offer the last stages for athletes to earn points as they seek to qualify for the final, where trophies and prize money will be up for grabs.. The series began in April with a double-header in China, where Duplantis opened his season in spectacular fashion by breaking the pole vault world record in Xiamen, before Briton Daryll Neita made an exciting start to her season by beating world 100m champion Sha'Carri Richardson to win over 200m in Suzhou.. British rising star Molly Caudery underlined her Olympic gold medal potential by beating reigning pole vault world champion Nina Kennedy in Doha, where Neita continued her winning start by triumphing over 100m.. The highly anticipated Prefontaine Classic in Eugene brought significant victories for British pair Josh Kerr and Keely Hodgkinson, with Kerr setting a British mile record in defeating rival Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Hodgkinson taking a commanding 800m victory over world champion Mary Moraa.. In Oslo, Matt Hudson-Smith produced a statement performance in his season opener as the world 400m silver medallist set a European record, while Ingebrigtsen responded to his Eugene loss in dramatic fashion by diving across the line to claim victory on home soil..

bbc.com,What is happening to gas and electricity bills?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58090533,2024-05-24 09:51,"Gas and electricity bills will fall by an average 7% in England, Scotland and Wales on 1 July.. The new energy price cap means the typical annual bill paid by direct debit will fall to ��1,568 per year.. However, while bills will be at their lowest for two years, they remain about ��400 higher than three years ago.. The energy price cap covers 28 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months, external by the energy regulator Ofgem.. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit.. From 1 July until 30 September, gas prices will be capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh. . The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Prices are also falling there.. Ofgem said that from 1 July, a household using a typical amount of energy and paying by direct debit, external for dual gas and electrici pay ��1,568 per year.. That is a fall of ��122 compared to the annual bill on charges between April and June.. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay more, with a typical bill of ��1,668 a year.. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. . The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, and how many people live there, are also relevant.. The Ofgem cap is""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single contract for gas and electricity, which they pay by direct debit.. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way, to help spread payments across the year.. Those who pay every three months by cash and cheque are charged more. . In March, Ofgem said it was considering a range of options for changing the current energy cap system. . From 1 July households on pre-payment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of ��1,522.. Since April they have paid the same as those on direct debit, but were previously charged more.. About four million households had prepayment meters in July 2023, according to Ofgem. . Many have been in place for years, but some meters were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay their bills. . New rules mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter, and they cannot be installed at all in certain eholds.. Although the overall cap has fallen, standing charges - a fixed daily amount which covers the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged.. Standing charges are 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region.. Ofgem said tens of thousands of customers responded to its recent consultation about how standing charges work.. The regulator is also adding ��28 to everyone's bill over the year to cover the cost of dealing with ��3.1bn of debt that customers owe to suppliers.. The fall in energy prices raised hopes that suppliers would offer cheaper, fixed-price deals.. These offer certainty for a set period, but if prices drop further, people could find themselves stuck at the higher price.. Analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have forecast a rise in the typical bill to ��1,762 in October, staying at that level in January. However, forecasts are not always correct and may change owing to events.. When considering switching to a fixed-price deal, Ofgem should seek independent advice and ""consider what is most important for them, whether that's the lowest price or the security of a fixed deal"".. Price comparison website Uswitch says it expects ""increased competition"" from suppliers, but warns that people to check any exit fees if they want to leave a fixed deal early.. Certain groups - such as pensioners and those on some means-tested or disability benefits - received extra cost-of-living payments when bills soared. . But much of that extra support has now finished. .

However, previous changes to the way tax is calculated mean the amount people pay overall is rising. . The starting rate for NI changed from 10% to 8% for 27 million workers on 6 April 2024.. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who announced the measure in the Budget, said this was worth about ��450 a year to an employee on an average salary of ��35,000.. Two million self-employed workers also got a cut in the main rate of NI.. Contributions on all earnings between ��12,570 and ��50,270 have been cut from a rate of 9% to 6%. The government has said that is worth ��350 to a self-employed person earning ��28,200. . Your device may not support this calculator. NI was also cut at the start of the year. Since 6 January, millions of employees have been paying 10% on their earnings between ��12,571 and ��50,270, external. They previously paid 12%. . The government has said that when combined with the latest cut, a worker on ��35,000 we self-employed, Class 4 NI contributions on all earnings between ��12,570 and ��50,270 were already due to be cut from a rate of 9% to 8% in April. They will no longer pay a separate category of NI called Class 2 contributions. . The NI rate on income and profits above ��50,270 remains at 2%. . The government uses National Insurance contributions (NICs) to pay for benefits and help fund the NHS. . NI rates apply across the UK. You start paying NI when you turn 16 and earn over ��242 a week, or have profits of more than ��12,570 a year. . It is not paid by people over the state pension age, even if they are working. . Eligibility for some benefits, including the state pension, depends on the NI contributions you make across your working life, external.. The government records how many years of contributions you have made. Paying a lower rate of NI does not mean you contribute fewer years. . If you do not work, for example because you are a carer or claim benefits, you might be able to recead, which mean you will still qualify for the relevant benefits. . You can also make voluntary contributions to plug gaps in your record.. How does National Insurance work?, external. Check your National Insurance record, external. Despite the NI cuts in January and April, millions will still pay more tax overall because of changes to the tax thresholds. . These are the income levels at which people start paying NI or income tax, or have to pay higher rates. . These used to rise every year in line with inflation. . However, the NI threshold and tax-free personal allowance - the amount you can earn every year before you have to pay income tax, external - have been frozen at ��12,570 until 2028. Higher-rate tax will continue to kick in for earnings above ��50,270. . Freezing the thresholds means that more people start paying tax and NI as their wages increase, and more people pay higher rates. . It will create 3.2 million extra taxpayers by 2028, and 2.6 million more people will pay higher rates, accordhe Office for Budget Responsibility, external (OBR), which conducts independent assessments of the government's economic plans. . According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think thank, the freeze cancels out the benefits of the NI cuts for some workers. . In the upcoming financial year, an average earner will have a tax cut of about ��340 - from the combined tax changes - and people earning between ��26,000 and ��60,000 will be better off. . But by 2027, the average earner would be only ��140 better off - and only people earning between ��32,000 and ��55,000 a year would be better off.. Income tax is paid on earnings from employment and profits from self-employment during the tax year, which runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year.. Income tax is also paid on some benefits, external and pensions, income from renting out property, and returns from savings, external and investments, external above certain limits. .

Anyone earning more than ��125,140 a year no longer has any tax-free personal allowance. . The additional rate of income tax is 45%, and is paid on all earnings above ��125,140 a year. . These apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.. Some income tax rates are different, external in Scotland. . In Scotland a new 45% band has taken effect.

bbc.com,Five hacks to help save money on your food shop,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61798003,2023-11-29 15:53,"As price rises bite into budgets, many people are cutting back on the weekly food shop.. Makers of some popular food brands have raised prices by more than their costs over the past two years, according to the UK's competition watchdog.. As well as buying less, people are looking for ways to make their money go further and to make the most of what they have. The BBC spoke to money bloggers for their tried and tested tips.. Rosie suggests taking a good look at your cupboards before each shopping trip. ""We all know the value of making a list, but if you're adding to what you've already got in your cupboards, then you're going to spend money on things you don't need,"" she says. . ""There's no point in buying more jars of pasta sauce if you've already got five of them in the cupboard."" . Rosie Forshaw has cut her food shop down to ��40 a week. She keeps a list of what's in her cupboards in a notebook, so she always knows what she already has when she goes shopping. She says it has helped bring her weekly food shop for her, her husband and one-year-old son down to around ��40.. Lynn recommends changing how you shop when you walk into a store and to head straight for the reduced s""If you spot something there that's on your list, you can tick that off and you've already saved some money,"" she says.. She suggests then going straight to the frozen-foods section, and then the canned-produce aisle.. ""Frozen meat, fish and vegetables will almost always be cheaper than the fresh option,"" she says. ""If you get what you need from there before going on to the fresh produce aisles, you're likely to make significant savings."". According to sustainability charity Wrap, the average household wastes around ��700 every year , externalby throwing food away. Lynn says making better use of her freezer has helped her cut down dramatically on wast""If things are getting close to their use-by date you should always try to freeze them,"" she says. ""Things like milk and cheese, even fruit and vegetables, can all be frozen and kept for when you need them."". Kate Hall says freezing food can make it last. More on the basics of freezing can be found on the Food Standards Agency website, external.. Kate Hall, who runs The Full Freezer website, uses her freezer as a pause button rather than a long-term storage solution. She says that while almost all foods can be frozen, you do have to change the way you use them.. ""You can't defrost a banana or salad and expect it to be the same as when it went into the freezer,"" she explains. ""But if you think about how you could use it in puddings or in soups or in casseroles, then you're going to save a lot of money."". Rosie says that a lot of what we buy in the supermarket is packaged for their convenience and not ours. ""How often have you bought a tray of mushrooms covered in cling film only to have them go off in their packaging? They're wrapped up like that to make them easier to transport,"" she explains. . She puts hers in a paper bag when she gets them home but says just taking off the plastic wrapping will help them last longer.. Helen White, from Wrap, which runs the Love Food Hate Waste campaign, says there are small things we can do to make food last longer, especially fresh vegetables and salads - the UK's most wasted food group. . ""Just putting a piece of kitchen roll into an open bag of salad to absorb moisture is going to help it last longer,"" she says. . Keeping fruit in the fridge will help it last longer, but she suggests checking that the temperature is set to below 5��""We think millions of UK fridges are at least two degrees too warm,"" she says. ""This is bad news for milk and other food items kept in the fridge, which can go off [more quickly] when not stored at the right temperature."". Rosie tries to use local, smaller retailers a lot to tap into their years of experience. . ""Butchers are a great resource and someone we shouldn't be afraid to talk to about saving money,"" she says. ""If you go into your local butcher and tell them you've only got ��8 for your meat for the week, they'll be able to tell you how to stretch your money by buying the cheapest cut""They're the best people to advise on how to cook them and how to make them go further."". We asked you for your tips, here are some you sent in: . My wife and I sit with our iPads on both Asda and Tesco and put in the exact same things for our weekly delivery. We then check at the end total costs including delivery and whoever is cheapest 'wins' our order. We feel that writing a list of things you need then getting them online saves going to the shop where we would invariably end up throwing things in that we don't need. Russell, Portstewart, Northern Ireland. I highly recommend having a weekly menu, so you know what you are going to cook/prepare for your meals each week. I post this on our fridge and our family of five always knows what to expect. This not only saves money but eliminates the stress of ""what's for dinner""? I know exactly what I need to get, and I stick to my budget because I go to the supermarket with a plan, plus I check the fridge/pantry before I go shopping. Michelle Lutchman, Surrey. Tip is not about food but about cleaning products. There is much money to be saved on laundry and cleaning products. These are full of gimmicks to make us buy additional stuff. For instance, you don't need separate washing powder for coloureds. Fading is largely due to exposure to daylight rather than brighteners in washing powder. Helen Borodzicz, Lytham, St Annes.  I go to the supermarket at about 2.30 pm when they are reducing sandwiches - that's my tea sorted! Sue Tingey, Wiltshire. How is the rising cost of living changing the food you eat?

People may also be encouraged to save more.. In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.. But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.. For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. . Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. . In May, the Bank of England held rates at 5.25% for a sixth time.. Governor Andrew Bailey said the BoE needed to ""see more evidence"" that price rises had slowed but that he was ""optimistic that things are moving in the right direction"". .

bbc.com,How are universal credit rules changing?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41487126,2024-05-13 13:44,"Many people receiving universal credit (UC) will now have to work longer hours, as part of government plans to encourage people into employment.. However, the Turn2Us charity warned of a ""drastic impact"" on people with long-term health conditions, caring responsibilities or irregular incomes.. Universal credit is a single benefit payment for working-age people, external. . It was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people. . There were 6.4 million people on UC in January in England, Scotland and Wales, according to official government statistics., external Nearly 40% of claimants have jobs.. The government is expected to spend ��90bn on UC in 2024-25.. That compares with ��153bn on state pensions and other benefits for pensioners, ��40bn on disability benefits and ��14bn on child benefit.. For UC claimants required to work, the minimum number of hours was increased from 15 to 18, on Monday 13 May.. The rule change means 180,000 people will have to work more or risk losing their benefits, the Department for Work and Pensions says.. The 18-hour minimum applies to people earning the National Living Wage (��11.44 for those aged 21 or over).. Someoneur can work fewer hours, as long as their total earnings meet a level called the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET)..

Claimants already risk having their benefits reduced if they don't take steps to earn more and meet regularly with a work coach.. Certain groups will remain exempt from sanctions - including people who can't work because of long-term sickness, or a disability.. Turn2Us has claimed government plans to speed up the roll-out of UC - and bring down spending on welfare - could affect vulnerable people disproportionately. . The government says its plans are necessary to get more people back in work and boost the economy, as levels of long-term sicknesncreased.. It claims that changes it is phasing in for the welfare system as a whole could save ��4bn a year. . Labour, however, says the Conservatives' failure to tackle problems facing the NHS, such as long waiting lists, should be prioritised instead.. The amount you get depends on whether you are single, or claiming as a couple, and your age. There is one standard allowance per household:. Single claimant under 25: ��311.68 a month. Single claimant 25 or over: ��393.45 a month. Joint claimants both under 25: ��489.23 a month. Joint claimants either aged 25 or over: ��617.60 a month. You may be entitled to extra money if, for example, you have children. . Extra money may also be available for rent payments, which works in different ways across the UK. .

bbc.com,When will interest rates come down?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57764601,2024-05-22 11:39,"The Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% in May, but cuts are expected later in the year, as inflation continues to fall.. Interest rates affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK.. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it.. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money.. This influences what other banks charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, and the interest they pay on savings.. The Bank of England moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - the increase in the price of something over time.. When inflation is high, the Bank - which has a target to keep inflation at 2% - may decide to raise rates.. The idea is to encourage people to spend less, to help bring inflation down by reducing demand.. Once this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them.. The Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 16 years.. However, it was higher than this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and was 17% in November 1979, external.. There have been questions about why interest rates have not been cut, as inflation is now much lower than its peak of 11.1% in October 2022.. It was 2.3% in April, down sharply from the March figure due to a drop in energy prices.. Speaking after May's decision to keep interest rates at 5.25%, the Bank's governor Andrew Bailey said he was ""optimistic that things are moving in the right direction"".. But he said the Bank needed to ""see more evidence"" that price rises had slowed further before cutting interest rates.. He left open the possibility of an interest rate cut at its next meeting on 20 June.  . However, inflation in the services sector - which includes everything from hospitality to hairdressing - remains higher than expected, so some experts think a cut later in the summer is more likely. . The Bank has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, or having to raise interest rates again very soon in the future.. Bank optimistic 'things moving in right direction'. While UK inflation is currently close to the Bank's target of 2%, it is expected to rise a little over the course of the year before settling back down in early 2025.. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recommended that UK interest rates should fall to 3.5% by the end of 2025.. But the organisation, which advises its members on how to improve their economies, acknowledged that the Bank had to balance the risk of not cutting too quickly before inflation is under control.. Mortgages. Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey, external.. When interest rates rise or fall, more than 1.2 million people on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) deals usually see an immediate change in their payments.. More than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, any future deals are. . Mortgage rates are much higher than they have been for much of the past decade.. This means homebuyers and those remortgaging have to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. . About 1.6 million deals will expire in 2024, according to banking trade body UK Finance.. You can see how your mortgage may be affected by interest rate changes by using our calculator:.

Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. . Lenders could decide to put their rates up if they expect higher interest rates from the Bank of England. However, if rates fall, interest payments may get cheaper.. Low interest rates are good for borrowers, but bad for savers. Savings. The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers can earn on their money. . Individual banks and building societies have been under pressure to pass on higher interest rates to customers.. There are some good deals on the market and experts say customers should shop around, as money may be in accounts paying little or no interest.. The UK's financial watchdog warned banks will face ""robust action"" if they offer unjustifiably low savings rates to customers.. Interest rates have been increasing across the world over the past few years. . However, in recent months, other central banks - including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank - have also paused their rate rises, with the next moves expected to be downwards..

bbc.com,How do I know if my smart meter is broken?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68664200,2024-03-26 15:17,"Almost four million smart meters in Great Britain were not working at the end of 2023, according to government data.. Faulty meters can mean customers rely on estimated bills, with some paying too much and struggling to get their money back.. Smart meters measure how much gas and electricity you use. You get one meter for each energy supply.. They can record half-hourly price and consumption data, external and automatically send readings to your energy supplier at least once a month.. According to the Energy Saving Trust, this means you will be billed accurately for the energy you've used.. Smart meters usually come with an in-home display, which can help you track how much energy you're using.. Almost four million smart meters not working properly. Smart meters don't use your wifi.. Instead, they include a communications hub which connects the smart meter to the in-home display as well as a secure national smart meter network.. This lets smart meters talk to different energy suppliers, says Ofgem.. Some earlier smart meters use the 3G network instead.. In-home displays, which update every 30 minutes for gas and in near real-time for electricity, external, don't affect the readings supplied to your energy company, external.. All smart meters have to be officially approved and their accuracy is monitored, external, the UK government says.. Smart Energy GB, a government-backed non-profit organisation supporting the use of smart meter technology, says they are as accurate as traditional meters, external.. According to government figures, there were almost 35 million smart meters in homes and businesses, external across Great Britain at the end of 2023. . Almost four million of those were not working properly, according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.. This means they were not operating in ""smart mode"" and sending readings to suppliers.. Martin Lewis says he believes one in five smart meters don't work. However, Martin Lewis, from MoneySavingExpert, told the BBC Radio 4 PM programme that meters with other problems - such as those sending the wrong readings, or a fault with the in-home display - should also be included in the government statistics. . This would mean that about one in five smart meters don't work, he said.. Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, says suppliers must replace faulty meters. . Unusual bills, sometimes caused by connectivity issues, and a blank screen on the meter can be signs it is not working correctly.. Your bill will also contain information that could help you find out.. According to Which?, readings on your bill should be marked ""smart"", external. . If they are marked with an ""e"", they're estimated readings, says Citizens Advice.. You can also use its smart checker tool, external to see if there is a problem between the meter and the central network.. You should contact your supplier - it should help you fix your meter.. If they fail to do so within eight weeks, Ofgem has a guide on how to complain to the Energy Ombudsman., external It advises taking manual meter readings in the meantime. . Customers who are concerned about paying their bill should also talk to their energy provider. Suppliers are required to offer tailored repayment plans and, where appropriate, payment holidays, Ofgem said.. You can also request an independent test of your meter, external, says Smart Energy GB.. Although it is free, you may have to pay your supplier for organising it if your meter is found to be working correctly.. The government says this was the case for the vast majority of meters tested in 2021. . What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?. What is the energy price cap?. Conventional energy meters need to be replaced every 10 to 20 years and most suppliers no longer install non-smart versions.. However, it is not compulsory to have a smart meter unless your current meter is faulty or at the end of its working life, says Ofgem.. You can therefore choose not to accept an offer to have one fitted. . However, if you refuse, you might find it hard to access all tariffs, external, according to Citizens Advice.. In general, suppliers must install a smart meter if they are replacing a meter or installing a meter for the first time, external, such as in a new property, says Ofgem..

bbc.com,Energy bills predicted to fall by 7% in July,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51nykexzj8o,2024-05-17 11:47,"Domestic energy bills are predicted to fall by a further 7% in July, offering some relief to households struggling with their budgets.. The bill for a home using a typical amount of gas and electricity could drop from ��1,690 a year to ��1,574, according to consultancy Cornwall Insight.. That follows previous falls and would mean a typical annual bill could be ��500 down on last summer.. The energy regulator, Ofgem, will announce the level of the quarterly price cap from July on 24 May.. Ofgem's latest quarterly price cap affects 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. Rules are different in Northern Ireland, where prices are also falling.. The price cap sets the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity but not the total bill - so if you use more, you will pay more.. Energy prices are already at their lowest level since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but - even with this predicted fall - would remain higher than pre-pande""We must recognise lower prices don't erase all the problems,"" said Craig Lowrey, from Cornwall Insight. . ""The very fact we are still seeing bill levels which are hundreds of pounds above pre-crisis levels underscores the ongoing challenges faced by households."". Looking further ahead, the consultancy has forecast bills would go up slightly in October before falling again the following January.. Ofgem is gathering views on the way the price cap is calculated, including whether there should be a change to standing charges.. They are the fixed daily charges covering the costs of connecting to a supply, which have risen sharply in some areas.. A fall in energy bills would feed through to the rate of inflation, and may create more impetus for the Bank of England to reduce interest rates.. Read more here.

bbc.com,How to get a job: Six expert tips for finding work,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64939070,2024-04-16 11:11,"If you're on the hunt for a job and not sure where to start, or how to pitch yourself you're not alone.. The rising cost of living has meant thousands of businesses have been laying off staff, with many people finding themselves out of work. . But about 10.8 million people, external are out of work, either unemployed or classed as economically inactive.. It may feel daunting to try and find a job at first so we spoke to some career experts to give you some tips.. There have been a lot of shifts in the workplace in recent years. Hybrid and flexible working means your job search can stretch a bit further, quite literally. . Yvonne Smyth, group head of diversity and inclusion at Hays Recruitment says ""Proximity isn't as important as used to be, so if you're looking for a job, search far and wide in terms of geography. . ""Also if you want to work part-time or say four days a week, don't let full-time positions put you off applying,"" she says.. ""Businesses are more flexible than you might think and if you're the right candidate that can get the job done in fewer days it makes sense for them to adapt the role."". Ms Smyth also says it's important to use key words when you're searching online.. ""For example if there's a key skill or industry like sales or retail that you're interested in, you want the algorithms on search platforms to pick up on them. . ""So daily searches on these words are important, so it identifies what you're interested in. . ""Engagement as well is key and that means clicking on jobs with the job titles or a company that you're keen on so the platform yields more of the same."". Not all jobs are made public. It's always worth sending an email or having a chat with a manager at a business that you like the look of, as you never know when an opening might be coming up. . Many businesses want to avoid the cost of advertising a job formally and may rely on word of mouth. . Miranda Kyte, a career trends expert at Glassdoor says: ""Another route is to utilise your network, let friends, ex-colleagues, family know that you're looking for a new position.. ""They may be able to check internal job boards for open roles at their own companies and refer you or they could know someone else who can help."". Lots of places still ask for a CV and a covering letter when you're applying for a job. . But now you can advertise yourself rather visibly via social media sites like Linkedin which showcase your skills and experience. . Other platforms like Twitter and Instagram can prove useful when touting yourself out to potential employers as well. . Yvonne Smyth from Hays says it's important to focus on skills.. ""Lots of people look at the years required on a job description but actually it's more important that a candidate has the right skills. Try to look for parallels and make that obvious in your application."" . It can be a little disheartening if the jobs you want require specific very specific qualifications. It may be worth having a look at if there are any ways of picking up the experience or training that you need to land a job while you're on the hunt. . Miranda Kyte from Glassdoor says: ""Lots of courses these days are free and you can do them online. Volunteering is also a great way of filling gaps on your CV or asking to do some work shadowing in companies you'd like to work for."". It's easy to get disheartened if you are knocked back after interviews time and time again, or you don't feel like you're getting through the door in the first place. . Our career experts say it's good to review how you're going about your search from time to time and try different approaches. . Career influencer, Mehar Sindhu Batra, says it's quite useful to set personal targets, like a tracker of the number of jobs to apply for in a week or a certain number of cold emails. . She's a big believer in acknowledging the little wins along the way to keep your spirits up. .

bbc.com,Health leaders warn of 'catastrophic' cuts impacts,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg33qvv00n2o,2024-06-02 23:09,"Cutbacks in Northern Ireland's health service could have ""catastrophic impacts"", the chairs of the health and social care trusts have warned.. In a joint statement, the heads of NI's six trusts said they are ""deeply concerned at the financial outlook for the frontline services"" their organisations deliver.. ""It is our duty to warn of the very real potential for avoidable and serious harm being caused to people in our community who require our help, as a result of inadequate budgetary provision,"" they said.. The warning comes after the Department of Health (DoH) launched a consultation on its budget savings plans in May.. Its Permanent Secretary, Peter May, said the health service is currently facing unfunded spending pressures of ��472m, of which ��375m relates to a pay claim matching NHS England.. The chairs of NI's five regional health trusts and the NI Ambulance Service tru""intensive efforts are ongoing to deliver a significant level of savings this year"" and that ""even with these savings,"" a ""very significant shortfall remains that could only be filled by measures with high and catastrophic impacts"".. ""The reality is that without significant additional funding this year and longer-term financial security, the health service will be further destabilised and the public will bear the brunt,"" their statement added.. ""Such cutbacks would inevitably include bed closures as well as reductions in outpatient care, operating lists, domiciliary care and nursing care packages. . ""This would impact damagingly on the whole community in Northern Ireland, particularly the most vulnerable."". In February the devolved government in Northern Ireland was restored after a 24-month hiatus, during which there were no departmental ministers in place. . Chairman of the Western Trust Dr Tom Frawley told BBC News NI the absence of politicians had created difficulties regarding the transformation of Northern Ireland's health service.. ""The health service knows what the blueprint is, knows what it needs to do and has been developing the analysis to inform that,"" he said. ""But we���ve had no politicians, who are required to make these judgements and finalise those judg"". Referring to strains on GP and pharmacy services as well as on hospitals, Dr Frawley said the ""whole system is under intense pressure and it is therefore not in a position to cope with a significant financial cut"".. He said ""crucial"" services will be impacted because of ""the level of cut that���s now being re"" of health trusts to make. . ""What worries me is that it is the most vulnerable who will suffer in these circumstances and those are the people we should be most concerned about,"" he added.. ""When you take a large sum of money out of the system then you reduce its capacity to respond to those pressures even further, with the implication that circumstances will become worse."" . The health trusts' warning comes after the chair of the Royal College of GPs in Northern Ireland said pressure on the health service means patients are either paying with ""their livelihoods or... their lives"".. Dr Ursula Mason said doctors cannot ""keep doing more and more with less and less"".. On Tuesday the Northern Ireland Assembly passed its first budget in three years, despite several parties voting against the move..

bbc.com,Swinney urges voters 'to put Scotland's interests first',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crggnq0yq99o,2024-06-02 16:41,"John Swinney has urged people to ""vote SNP to put Scotland's interests first"" as he formally launched the party's general election campaign.. Mr Swinney told activists and candidates at a rally in Glasgow that Westminster decision-making had meant ""austerity, Brexit and a cost of living crisis being imposed on Scotland"".. Scotland's first minister stressed his belief in independence as a way to ensure decisions about Scotland are made in Scotland.. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said John Swinney's ""relaunch of a shambolic campaign"" proved he was more interested in his party than the people.. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accused Mr Swinney of ""pandering to his Nationalist base and pitting Scot against Scot in a bid to break up the UK"".. Meanwhile, Scottish Lib Dems leader Alex Cole-Hamilton also criticised the SNP's continued push for a second independence referendum - insisting voters simply ""don't care"".. However, Mr Swinney has called on the public to back his party's indy stance in the 4 July general election and use the vote as a direct way to remove the Conservatives from government.. He said: ""A combination of Westminster cuts and Brexit has reduced the money available for the NHS, other public services and housing.. ""Brexit alone has wiped billions from the Scottish economy compared with EU membership. And it's pushed up food and other household costs.. ""Given the UK is moving so badly in the wrong direction I would be failing in my duty if I did not set out what I believe is a better future for Scotland."". Following his election as first minister last month, Mr Swinney called for more respect to be shown in Scottish politics.. Looking ahead to the UK-wide general election, he said he believes in ""the politics of persuasion or, if that's not possible, respectful disagreement""..  He told those at the rally that ""in our wonderful, diverse, inspiring country"" everyone should have a chance to get on in life.. ""It's why I believe so strongly in eradicating child poverty,"" the first minister will say.. ""At this election it is those principles that will guide my approach. So I am asking people to vote SNP to remove the Tories from government.. ""I'm asking people to vote SNP to put Scotland's interests first. I'm asking people to vote for a future made in Scotland, for Scotland."". Mr Swinney also highlighted what the he said the SNP had achieved in government, including:. Analysis by Phil Sim, BBC Scotland political correspondent. John Swinney���s calculation is that a Labour win is already priced in for many in this election.. At his launch event, he predicted that ���the Tories are on course for a huge defeat, a wipeout���.. The pitch is that the Tories are toast anyway, and Labour will have a big majority - so Scots don���t actually need to vote for Labour to achieve that. Indeed, he says they should vote for the SNP to keep Labour honest - to hold their feet to the fire.. He���s painting them as already being complacent - ���they think Scotland is in the bag���.. The question is whether this message - that people can have a Labour government without actually voting Labour - will cut through with voters, compared to the rather more straightforward ���change��� narrative Sir Keir Starmer is selling.. Speaking on BBC Scotland's Tilton said his party was not talking about independence during this campaign ""because literally no-one on the doorsteps is talking about it - they don���"".. He added: ""We don���t believe there should be a second referendum ��� it���s not salient to p""People want to talk about getting access to a GP at the first time of asking, or NHS dentists in their locality.. ""They want to talk about taking the sewage out of our rivers and lifting up Scottish education to where it used to be."". Speaking on the campaign trail in Renfrew, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the SNP had spent the entire campaign so far attacking Labour when the real opportunity was to ""get rid of this rotten Tory government"".. He said: ""That���s what we���re focused on ��� getting rid of Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman and the whole, rot""People across Scotland realise after 14 years of corruption, chaos, lies and sleaze from the Conservative party that this is Scotland���s opportunity to get rid of them. And the only way we do that is if we elect a UK Labour gover"". Mr Sarwar said he was confident previous SNP supporters would switch to Labour on 4 July.. ""I don���t care how you voted in the past. I don���t care how you voted in the referendum. I don���t care how you would possibly vote in fut""What I care about just now is getting rid of this rotten Tory government, so let���s go on this part of the journey together and change our co"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr Swinney had made ""a desperate attempt"" to relaunch the SNP���s election cam""in the wake of his shameful mishandling of the Michael Matheson scandal"".. Mr Matheson - a former health secretary - was last week handed a record ban from parliament for breaching Holyrood's expenses policy. . And police are now assessing a new complaint over the SNP MSP's ��11,000 iPad data roaming bill.. Douglas Ross said: ���Predictably, he (Mr Swinney) used it to double down on the SNP���s independence obsession, instead of focusing on the people���s real priorities ��� fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.. ���As he showed in the Matheson scandal, John Swinney wil"". Mr Ross added: ���Voters who have had enough of SNP incompetence and their endless sowing of division have the chance to punish them on Jul""In key seats across the country, only the Scottish Conservatives can beat the SNP and move the focus on to the issues that really matter.���. How do people say they will vote in the UK general election? Our poll tracker measures the trends.. Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross backs the prime minister's ��20m pledge to 30 UK towns.. Parties are looking to shift ground ��� and the key issue is economic growth. . The former health secretary was banned from parliament and docked pay over the scandal..

Kennedy Jr., the U.S. presidential candidate, spoke at a press conference Thursday at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas. Here are some of his comments:Donald Trump's guilty verdict""I'm going to talk about issues of broader concern. I want to focus on the economic issues and the health issues. That's what my campaign is about. I'm not going to get dragged into the dirt pile. I don't have any thoughts. I've been very disciplined in not talking about lawsuits against [Joe] Biden or Trump.""Read more: RFK Jr. Says Guilty Verdict May Help Trump's Election ProspectsThoughts on Trump's new pro-crypto stance""I'm happy about that. I think it's a good thing for our country. Commitment to crypto is a commitment to freedom and transparency. I'm not going to question if it was a political decision. I'm happy he did it, and I hope President Biden does, too.""Biggest issues facing crypto regulation in the U.S.""I think transactional freedom is one. We need sovereignty over our own wallets, transactional freedom and a currency that is transparent. We need to make sure America remains the hub of blockchain technology. I'm going to make sure cryptocurrency is regulated in a way that protects the consumer from deceptive schemes. I purchased 21 bitcoins since I started this campaign. I also bought three coins for each of my kids.""What does the future hold for crypto fans?""My objective if elected president is that crypto is a transactional currency. That people can have transactional freedom. That people have a choice as to whether they can buy it. I think it should be treated as a currency; we shouldn't be taxing it as capital gains. I think there are issues in how we do that. I believe that it should be a currency used to purchase things like apples, lunches and coffee and that people can do that.""What inspired him to run for president""I toyed with getting into politics when I was younger. For two decades I took that off the plate. I saw what happened during Covid and when the government shut down the economy. I thought it was wrong. The government shut down every church, attacked the 5th amendment, shut down business without due process ��� they shut down jury trials, they violated prohibitions and I saw this attack on the constitution and censorship, not just to me but so many people who were trying to talk. I saw that and it seemed so unethical to my country. All these traditional values for my party and my country were disappearing, and I felt I could play a unique role in showing people what America's supposed to look"""

The broader CoinDesk 20 was down 1.1% over the last day.May, though, has been strong for bitcoin, which is now higher by 11% since beginning the month at around the $60,000 level.

coindesk.com,Everyone at Consensus 2024 Is Talking About Biden���s Crypto Flip Flop. Is He for,https://www.coindesk.com//opinion/2024/05/30/everyone-at-consensus-24-is-talking-about-bidens-crypto-flip-flop-is-he-for-real/,2024-05-30 21:14,"AUSTIN, Texas ��� The biggest news this year at Consensus seems to be the political sea change happening in the Democratic party over crypto. While President Biden���s administration essentially carried over the same reluctant-to-the-point-of-being-nearly-hostile approach to crypto as its predecessor, ever since the bottoming out of the industry in 2022 (the year from crypto hell) it has been actively hostile. The easiest way to sum up Biden���s ���whole of government��� attempt to wrangle in the crypto industry is with the catchphrase Operation Choke Point 2.0, coined by VC Nic Carter to describe the apparent debanking of many crypto firms.Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteBut in a matter of week with the bipartisan vote in the House and Senate to repeal the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission���s (SEC) much-maligned accounting bulletin (SAB121) and extending to yesterday���s reveal that the Biden administration is reportedly doing outreach to crypto firms in a late-stage attempt to hear what they have to say about what good crypto policy would look like, it has become (nearly) believable that brighter days are ahead on the political, regulatory and legislative fronts for the domestic crypto industry.See also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis) The feeling is in the air, probably because everyone appears to be voicing it out loud. For instance, yesterday on the Consensus stage, NYSE President Lynn Martin said that she doesn���t think that crypto will remain a ���partisan��� issue much longer. In the same way that stock and bonds are mostly apolitical, it doesn���t really make much sense to view crypto as inherently political (in for actually being apolitical, given the technical design of protocols like Bitcoin).However, not everyone is in alignment here. For instance, a big name crypto lawyer who works for a red hot DeFi startup, who asked not to be named given the sensitivity of his work, said he doesn���t think Biden���s apparent change of heart is genuine. ���He���ll likely revert back to course, if reelected,��� he said. Asked whether he felt any weight off his shoulders at all, or whether his job has or will get any easier, under seemingly improving regulatory conditions, he said ���absolutely not.��� Today is the same as yesterday.Austin Campbell, a Columbia University business lecturer who is plugged into the D.C. circuit, echoed this idea when noting that the seemingly parallel change in Congress is not likely permanent. In fact, if you look at how the voting on the landmark Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) happened, it largely broke down on age litive, given that younger members of Congress are more likely to ���get it,��� and despite the fact that U.S. politics is a gerontocracy, the dinosaurs won���t rule the world forever.This morning, Messari founder Ryan Selkis, who recently spoke with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago Club, and Uniswap Labs chief lawyer Marvin Ammori, a longtime Democratic operative, actually debated the recent political machinations afoot on the Main Stage. Selkis��� main argument was that any easing up on crypto by the Democrats is largely a result of Trump capturing the ���single issue��� crypto vote, and that it should be treated as suspect. While Ammori argued that political changes don���t flip like a switch, and that things like SAB121 and FIT21 were the result of real bipartisan collaboration and successful crypto lobbying.See also: Trump Widens Lead Over With Biden (on Polymarket and PredictIt) After Courting Crypto Vote���My point is, we don't necessarily want to be pang term,��� Ammori said. In other words, crypto should be wary of aligning itself with any one party or any one candidate ��� especially considering that campaign promises are rarely kept. For his part, Selkis wanted to step out of wishful thinking (i.e., that Democrats could be suddenly supportive of crypto after so many years) and into the realm of realpolitik (i.e., that if the theory of bipartisan support were true, it���d be because Dems��� needs have shifted).���Democrats right now are like a cheating spouse; we caught them with their pants down,��� Selkis said. ���To reward this Democrat, mainstream party at this point in time is not only foolish, but I think it shows a profound lack of se"

He'll also speak to BBC Radio 4's Today programme shortly after.. You can watch his Breakfast interview by clicking the Play button at the top of the page.. Emily Atkinson. Live reporter. Welcome to the morning “media round” – a series
of broadcast interviews given by the figures leading today’s news agenda.. Since it’s launch day for the Plaid Cymru manifesto, the first was with Liz Saville Roberts on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, which we covered below.. Shortly, we'll hear from Foreign Secretary David Cameron for the Conservatives and shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden for Labour.. Both McFadden and Cameron are due to speak on Today and BBC Breakfast.. And while that's happening, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting will be giving a round of interviews to regional radio, starting with BBC Radio Cambridgeshire just after 07:30.. We’ll bring you the key lines here -
and you can watch along live by clicking the Play button above.. Saville Roberts is now asked about how her party had to pull a candidate who liked a tweet from ex-British National Party (BNP) leader Nick Griffin, which described  Hamas as the ""resistance"". . How will her party deal with similar situations?. Saville Roberts says this is a problem for every political party, particularly as you go into a snap election. . She adds that she is now confident in all of Plaid Cymru's other candidates.. Saville Roberts is next asked about her party's wish to join the customs union and single market. . She says it has always been Plaid Cymru's point of view that Wales functions better as part of the European Union. . The next question is on whether Plaid is still pushing for an independent Wales - and if the party would call a referendum in 2026 if it won power.. She responds that the party are always working towards an independent Wales, without responding directly to the question of a referendum.. First up in this morning's media round of interviews is Liz Saville Roberts, who was Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader before Parliament was dissolved.. As a reminder, Plaid Cymru are launching their manifesto today, just before Labour.. Speaking on BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Saville Roberts says there is a ""paper's width"" between Labour and the Conservatives on austerity. . She says the election is about the cost of living crisis and the economy - and repeats a Plaid line about Wales being ""owed"" £4bn because HS2 will be an England-only railway line.. Before we turn to this morning's interviews, here's one more clip from last night's Sky News show with Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer (for a full recap, scroll back through this page, or read our report here).. Sky's Beth Rigby pressed the Labour leader on his comments from the 2019 general election campaign, when he said Jeremy Corbyn would ""make a great prime minister"". Here's his answer.... Here's a story you may have missed from Wednesday evening - a senior aide to Rishi Sunak has admitted having a ""flutter"" on the general election, with the Gambling Commission now investigating.. Tory candidate Craig Williams - who was the prime minister's
Parliamentary Private Secretary in the last Parliament - said on social media: ""I've been contacted by a journalist about Gambling Commission inquiries into one of my accounts and thought it best to be totally transparent.. ""I put a flutter on the general election some weeks
ago. This has resulted in some routine inquiries and I confirm I will fully
cooperate with these.. ""I don't want to be a distraction from the campaign, I
should have thought through how it looked."". According to the Guardian, Williams - who is standing for
election in Montgomeryshire & Glyndwr - placed a £100 bet on a July
election just three days before Sunak named 4 July as the date.. The newspaper reported the bet could have led to a £500 payout.. Chris Mason. Political editor. If you’re expecting surprises from Labour,
well – don’t.. It doesn’t look like there will be any. This
will be a manifesto seeking to reassure, rather than reveal.. To pull together, the party hopes, the “missions” for government Starmer has been fleshing out for the last
18 months centred on the economy, education, crime, health and energy.. Labour insist they amount to the foundations
for what it calls a ""decade of national renewal”.. The Conservatives, who’ve announced a blitz of
new policies in the last few weeks, claim Labour’s plans are empty.. As the Tories seek to draw a dividing line
with Labour on tax cuts, Starmer will counter that he rejects the instinct to
tax and spend, instead growing the economy is his central objective.. Delivering that, though, could well prove
rather more tricky.. The manifesto is around 23,000 words long,
we're told – that’s shorter than their doomed offering in 2019.. And if you’re not sure what Starmer looks
like when you start reading it, you will by the end – there are 34 pictures of
him within it.. Labour are likely to dominate election coverage today with their manifesto
launch, particularly as Sunak is briefly stepping back from the campaign
trail.. Unlike a lot of people heading to Italy at this
time of year, the prime minister isn't taking a break. Instead he'll be in Puglia for the G7 summit in the city of Bari. . The group of wealthy allied nations are expected to agree a
plan to use frozen Russian assets stashed in the West to raise $50 billion (£39
billion) a year for Ukraine.. The idea is to use interest from them to pay off a long-term
loan to Kyiv, helping the government stay afloat as Russia continues to wage
war on Ukraine.. Sunak
is also set to promise Ukraine £242 million to support its humanitarian and
energy needs.. The BBC’s Rome
correspondent Mark Lowen has more on the G7 summit here.. One of the most striking moments in the Sky News election programme last night was when a member of the audience pushed Starmer on whether he was speaking like a robot.. After an initial moment of what seemed like stunned silence, the Labour leader sought to defend himself against the charge of being boring.. Watch their exchange below:. Paul Seddon. Politics reporter. Starmer appeared on Sky News last night to make the case
for a Labour government - where he told the audience wealth creation would be
the ""number one priority"" in his party's general election manifesto.. The Labour leader also stressed there would be ""no surprises"" on tax, as he sought to
defuse Tory attacks that his party would put them up.. Only by
growing the economy can Labour generate the funds needed for public services,
he argued, after also making the case that people were ""taxed too much already”.. The
manifesto launch will be a chance for Labour to showcase key policies it had
already announced before the election campaign began.. These
include setting up a new state-owned energy investment and generation company,
hiring more police officers and renationalising nearly all passenger rail.. But the
party could also offer more detail in other priority areas such as planning
reform, which it has put front and centre of its economic plans.. For more detail on what we know about Labour's manifesto plans, click here.. Hywel Griffith. Wales correspondent. Plaid Cymru is also launching its election manifesto
today, saying it will demand a new funding deal for Wales. . A
fight for ""economic fairness"" is how Plaid Cymru pitches its manifesto –
pledging to secure more funding from the Treasury for Wales. . It has long argued
that the HS2 high-speed rail project should have triggered extra spending in
Wales, and says the nation is owed billions of pounds as a result. . It also
wants control over the Crown Estate’s land, sea and river beds around Wales to
be devolved as they are in Scotland. . One word which doesn’t figure prominently
it seems is independence. While that remains Plaid Cymru’s ultimate ambition,
its language seems to have softened under its leader Rhun ap Iorwerth, who
accuses the other parties of taking Wales for granted.. Nick Eardley. Political correspondent. A Labour figure told me yesterday they would avoid a ""sugar rush"" of policies.. The party’s argument is that the Conservatives
over-promised in their manifesto.. Labour say they won't do the same – so don’t expect
big surprises today.. But Labour do have pledges to pay for such as more NHS
appointments, more teachers, primary school breakfast clubs, more police and
police community support officers. . Where will they find the money? Labour point towards making
private schools pay VAT, a stricter windfall tax on oil and gas company profits, and collecting more of the tax money that's already owed – what is often called
“closing the tax gap”.. We’ll be able to scrutinise the numbers later.. But what’s also interesting is what Labour are ruling
out - rises in income tax rates, national insurance, VAT and corporation tax.. At the same time, they  are pledging to bring
debt down as a share of the economy.. All of which has led to warnings that there could be a
significant spending squeeze in some government departments after the election
– whoever wins.. Adam Durbin. Live reporter. Good morning, it’s a big day for the general election campaign
as Labour is due to set out key election pledges in its manifesto launch in a few hours' time. . We’re expecting party leader Keir Starmer to say he
will make economic growth his number one priority, should he win the election.. Last night, on a special Sky News election broadcast, he
told the audience there would be “no surprises” about taxes and argued people were taxed too heavily already.. As always with election manifestos, a lot of it has been trailed in
advance like Labour’s plans to create a new state-owned energy firm, recruit more police officers and renationalise nearly all passenger rail.. But these and many other policy priorities will almost
certainly be spelled out in greater detail, as the party makes its pitch to
voters.. It's not all Labour though, as Plaid Cymru are also due to put out their manifesto calling for, among other things, a new funding deal for Wales. . We’ll be reporting, analysing and fact-checking all the key
pledges  – so stay tuned for that as the day progresses.. And not that anyone in the newsroom is counting, but it's exactly three weeks to the day until polls open on 4 July.  . Halfway there. . Marita Moloney. Live reporter. We're going to pause our live coverage now after another day on the campaign trail.. Our team will be back first thing tomorrow to bring you all the latest election news and analysis from across the UK, but if you can't wait until then, there's lots to read across BBC News:. Thanks for joining us.. Ione Wells. Political correspondent. When I asked Mark Spencer, the former Conservative chief whip, what he
made of Craig Williams being investigated by the Gambling Commission (see our last post) - he said
there was a process under way.. I asked if the Tories were gaining a reputation for bad
behaviour that was not helping their election campaign, and he said this was an issue
that other parties faced too.. ""Some of my colleagues across the House have not covered
themselves in glory,"" he said.. When I then asked which party had the most MPs who lost the
whip in the last parliament, Spencer replied: ""We had the most MPs."". I asked if he was implying that meant it was okay to have
a higher number of suspended MPs for poor behaviour and Spencer added that ""one is
too many"".. Away from this evening's various political programmes, a story emerged earlier regarding a senior aide to Rishi Sunak.. Tory candidate Craig Williams has admitted that the Gambling Commission are making inquiries after he reportedly placed a bet on the date of the general election.. He said he put a ""flutter"" on the general election some weeks ago. In a statement he added: ""This has resulted in some routine inquiries and I confirm I will fully cooperate with these."". The Guardian reports that Williams placed a £100 bet on a July election just three days before Sunak named the date for the poll. . Kris Bramwell. Your Voice, Your Vote project. When Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer faced questions earlier, the Labour leader was grilled on his plan for the future of dentistry - and it's something many of you have told us is a major issue for you in this election.. Here's a flavour of what you've been telling us:. Find out more about Labour's plans for dentistry here, and the Conservatives' plans here. . Tell us what election issues matter to you, what we should explain, and the local issues you'd like us to report on here.. BBC Verify. Ben Chu. One last claim we at BBC Verify have been looking into, after the head-to-head between Rishi Sunak and Keir Stamer this evening. . Sunak said during it that Labour
would bring in a ""retirement tax"".. Pensioners relying solely on the state
pension are on course to potentially pay income tax in 2027-28, because the
state pension in that year (£12,578) is forecast to marginally overtake the
tax-free personal allowance (£12,570). . The Conservative triple lock plus policy -
raising the personal allowance for pensioners only to £13,710 by 2027-28
- would remove that risk.  . Labour haven’t said yet whether they would
match it or not. But note the Conservatives only unveiled the policy
within the last couple of weeks, so to present this as a planned Labour tax
rise is a bit disingenuous. . And bear in mind that triple lock plus
would only save someone living solely on the state pension around £29 a
year.. BBC Verify. Anthony Reuben. There was claim and counter-claim made about NHS waiting lists in
England this evening. . When Rishi Sunak pledged to bring waiting lists down at the
beginning of 2023, the overall list was at 7.2 million.. That's now gone up to 7.5 million, as it was put to him earlier. . But the prime minister was also right when he said ""what
you're now seeing is that the numbers are coming down"".. Lists have fallen from a peak of 7.8 million last September,
although there have been some changes to the way it’s being calculated in that
time.. . . . . . . . The next UK general election will take place on 4 July.. . . How do people say they will vote in the UK general election? Our poll tracker measures the trends.. "
bbc.com,"More funding and fairness for Wales, says Plaid",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggw27403lo,2024-06-13 06:31:35,"Wales needs more funding and ""economic fairness"" from Westminster, Plaid Cymru has said ahead of its general election manifesto launch later.. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said the general election was ""about one thing - the economy"".. He said Labour did not offer ""meaningful change"" after 14 years of ""Tory cuts and chaos"".. Plaid's manifesto, which is being launched in Cardiff, calls for the Welsh Parliament to have more power over natural resources and funding for public transport.. Wales is owed ""billions"" as a result of UK government spending on the HS2 railway from London to the West Midlands, Plaid said.. It is also calling for changes to how the Welsh government's budget is set in Westminster so funding matches Wales’ needs.. The party also wants control over the Crown Estate to be devolved so profits from its properties go to the government in Cardiff, not the UK Treasury.. All parties in the Senedd say the Welsh government’s budget should be topped up as a result of HS2.. But, under the Conservatives, the UK government has refused to classify the project in a way that would release more funding for Wales - and Labour has also not pledged to do so.. In March, Sir Keir Starmer said a Labour government would have to ""review that and make decisions when we are able to"".. Rishi Sunak has said money saved from cancelling the next phase of HS2 would be spent on electrifying the north Wales main line.. Mr ap Iorwerth said: ""We will fight every day for the billions owed to Wales from the HS2 high-speed rail project and for a fair funding model which funds our country according to need, not population.. ""On 4 July, we can send a message that Wales won’t be taken for granted any longer and that’s only by electing a strong group of Plaid Cymru MPs that will always demand fairness for their square mile and put Wales' best interests first in Westminster."". Speaking on the Today Programme, Plaid Cymru general election candidate Liz Saville Roberts said the party was also looking to re-enter the European Union. . She said Wales was ""kept in a state of continuous structural inequality within the United Kingdom"".. So the ""logical answer,"" she added, was to ""improve our relationship with our nearest neighbours, which of course is to re-join the single market and the customs union"".. After boundary changes, Plaid is defending two constituencies: Dwyfor Meirionnydd and Ceredigion Preseli.. It also hopes to fend off Labour and the Conservatives to gain another two target seats: Caerfyrddin and Ynys Mon.. Mr ap Iorwerth was appointed Plaid leader last June when his predecessor Adam Price stood down after a damning report into allegations of misogyny within the party.. Last month he led his party out of a co-operation agreement with Vaughan Gething's Welsh Labour government.. The party voted against First Minister Mr Gething in a no-confidence vote this month..

bbc.com,"Crime here is hurting, whatever the statistics say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7227ve4e9yo,2024-06-12 21:03:32,"On a terraced street in Middlesbrough, a teenager in a mask takes out a long kitchen knife from his trousers and says he’s prepared to use it. “It’s brutal round here, you have to be prepared, if you don’t stab them, they will stab you.”. He is part of a group of young drug dealers, and I have no reason to doubt him. One of them says he was 14 when he started. Why? Money - they talk openly about how much they can make from selling heroin and crack cocaine.. As if to emphasise the point, another in the group holds up small bags of white rocks, which he says are crack cocaine. They charge £10 a bag and say they can sell hundreds of bags every week.. “No-one is going to change it, the bobbies can’t change it,” one of the dealers says.. Wherever we went in Middlesbrough, people wanted to talk about the impact of drugs. On the Netherfields estate, we met Tony, proud to be from the town.. “I’ll show you something, we call it the penthouse,” he says excitedly. He shows me a small block of flats where nearly every window has been smashed out or boarded up.. And it’s not just the one - many more homes here have been vandalised and smashed. Tony is incandescent: “It’s degrading, we feel like a waste of space, like we’re non-existent.”. The demand for drugs is high. In 2022, the government estimated that there were more than 300,000 people dependent on heroin and crack cocaine in England. And between them, they were responsible for nearly half of all burglaries, robberies, and other acquisitive crime, like shoplifting.. The statistics  show that both the number of crimes recorded and the rate of crime has increased since before the pandemic, even if police say recorded crime (excluding fraud) fell by 1% in 2023 in England and Wales compared with the year before. Separately, the Crime Survey for England and Wales suggests that excluding fraud and computer misuse, crime has been steadily dropping since 2010.. It's a complex picture, but contributions to the BBC’s Your Voice, Your Vote project  told us that for many people, crime is a major issue that they want the politicians to fix. So we came to Middlesbrough to hear people’s experience of it here.. To many people who live in Middlesbrough, it certainly doesn’t feel like crime is falling. Last year, Cleveland police recorded the highest overall crime rate out of all forces in England and Wales, affecting 137 out of every 1,000 people.. I spent three days here, and found that crime numbers don’t tell the full story of what’s happening in communities like North Ormesby, who are desperate for help.. Aidan is in his 20s and has a young family to support. He works hard in a restaurant, grabbin. g every hour offered and he’s also set up his own business as a handyman. He says he sometimes works over 70 hours a week.. As we walk and talk, someone shouts “welcome to Beirut!“ Aidan says he’s desperate to succeed but admits to being scared in the place he calls home. He takes us to one street with about 50 homes, and we walk past smashed windows, boarded up windows, and homes with obscenities sprayed on the walls in red paint. He reckons that on this one street, about 20 homes have been burgled over the past four years.. Officially, fewer people are being burgled. The Crime Survey for England and Wales suggests that there are less than a fifth of the number of burglaries that there were back in 1995. But in 2023, Cleveland police recorded the second highest rate of theft and the second highest rate of violence against a person.. What Aidan says next explains a lot of the despair that people feel. “We’ve been burgled, the police never came out, all I got was a crime reference number.. “I’m paying more council tax, energy bills and rent than ever before but the services I’m getting back have decreased.”. The most recent annual Home Office data says that in the year to March 2023, fewer than 4% of burglary offences in England and Wales resulted in a charge, albeit this was up on the previous year. In North Ormesby, the part of Middlesbrough where Aidan lives, around 95 in every 100 crimes last year went unsolved.. Cleveland police say they’ve taken a proactive approach in Netherfields, imposing five dispersal orders and have arrested children as young as 12. CCTV now covers the estate and people here say the anti-social behaviour issues with teenagers is calming down. In North Ormesby and across the region, police say they are working closely with people in the community and working with multiple local agencies.. But in late 2022, the UK’s then lead for neighbourhood policing said officers were spending too much time taking care of social problems, and not enough on tackling crime. Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney, now retired, said officers could spend half their shifts working on behalf of other services.. She said it meant that victims were being failed and the criminal justice system was in crisis.. In North Ormesby we came across a classic example - a police van attending what we thought was an emergency call, only to realise it was a welfare check for a vulnerable woman called Kimberley.. “They’re not just here to help, they’re helping with the mental health. I’m ADHD, bipolar and emotional stability disorder,” she told us. “They’re really nice and they’ll sit with you and make you feel good.”. Less than half a mile away, on Kings Road, there is a parade of shops where locals told us there were thefts most days. It’s got so bad that the Candy Corner shop at the end of the road has started naming and shaming those accused of shoplifting, hanging a large canvas poster with their faces on it outside the shop. Under the faces it reads: “Steal from the shop and you will be our advert outside the shop for six months like these idiots.”. While we were on Kings Road, a group of five men stormed the supermarket, some with their faces covered. They were in and out in seconds and what did they steal? Chocolate bars.. Facing them behind the till was Ellie. “It was scary them coming in. I thought they were gonna take money,” she said. “It’s just the usual, every day,” she adds.. Ellie said the police usually only turn up if it happens a few times in a day. Speaking to her, it’s hard to believe anyone can be so accustomed to crime.. Shoplifting is up, especially in deprived areas. Offences recorded by police in England and Wales have risen to their highest level in 20 years.. More than 430,000 offences were recorded last year - up by more than a third compared with the previous 12 months to December 2022, according to the police figures.. Nearby we met a business owner who said they had started slapping thieves who tried to steal from their shop. They wanted to remain anonymous, but showed me CCTV of one incident. They said they feared that they couldn’t rely on police, so preferred to take matters in their own hands. When I asked about the risk of arrest, they said it was a risk worth taking to protect their livelihood.. Others are taking desperate measures too. Sarah, who runs Legends Bar in the town, says the bar has been targeted five times in two years, and shows us CCTV from the last break in. “You can see where they pulled the shutters, they tipped over a fruit machine worth thousands of pounds. They’ve done a lot of damage, it makes you feel sick.”. On that occasion, thieves stole two bottles of vodka and the Christmas tip jar. Sarah doesn't know of anyone being prosecuted for the thefts or damage at her bar, and on some occasions no longer claims on her insurance. She says crime is her number one issue this election.. “One day they came in and nicked my KP Nuts. Nuts! It’s horrendous.” She says she has started sleeping in the bar overnight sometimes, and has turned to Facebook to try to solve the crimes, and even offered rewards with her own money.. “Next time do I even ring the police? Do I just leave it? It can’t keep going on like this.”. Later I meet Meela outside her home, chatting with neighbours in Netherfields.. “As soon as I’m out of this area I’m a different person,” Meela says. “As soon as I get to the roundabout coming in, I get anxiety."". I ask her whether politics can fix this. No, she says. “It’s the drugs, people need to knock down the drugs.”. In just England alone there is a lot to fix. An independent review conducted for the government by Dame Carol Black in 2021 said drug misuse costs society almost £20bn a year, which is close to £350 for every man, woman, and child in England.. That means even if you’ll never visit Middlesbrough in your life, illegal drug dealing does impact on your life. When public spending on services we all need is tight, money spent on drug misuse is cash that is missing from other vital services.. Back in North Ormesby I wondered what this general election means to the teenage drug dealers, who tell me they are old enough to vote. One says they don’t know what it is all about. I also ask, if politicians say they want to crack down on drug dealing, what would you say to them? “Catch me if you can,” one says, and then they all start to laugh.. Is this all they want from life I ask? They are after all just teenagers. One of them takes time to answer. “I don’t want to sell drugs, for the rest of my life, no one does, it’s just how it is,"" he says.. Nationally, crime is not the biggest election issue. Concerns around the cost of living, the NHS, the economy and immigration all poll higher.. But in places like North Ormesby and Netherfields concerns about crime are very real. People are desperate for help. Before we leave, Tony tells me: “Whoever wins the next election needs to step up to the mark, this cannot continue.”.

bbc.com,Delays for cancer treatment becoming routine,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckrrll51xjdo,2024-06-12 23:42:11,"Long waits for cancer care are becoming routine across the UK with nearly half of  all specialist cancer centres experiencing delays most weeks, the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) has said.. The college has warned of an “impending crisis” in the cancer workforce, with a “staggering” 30% shortfall in radiologists and 15% shortfall in clinical oncologists.. The Conservative Party said it would meet current targets for cancer care in England by the end of the next parliament, if re-elected. . Labour has said it will double the number of scanners to improve early detection, while the Liberal Democrats said they would introduce a legal guarantee for all patients to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral in England.. . The RCR report was based on responses from senior managers at 60 specialist cancer centres in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.. The survey, carried out in November 2023, found the number of centres experiencing severe delays had almost doubled in a year.. Managers at 47% of sites said patients needing chemotherapy and other cancer drugs were facing delays “most weeks or every week”, up from reports of delays at  28% of sites the previous year.. Centres reporting weekly delays to radiotherapy also nearly doubled, from 22% in 2022 to 43% in 2023.. Almost all clinical directors surveyed said workforce shortages were causing backlogs.. “We simply do not have enough doctors to manage the increasing number of patients safely, and this problem will only worsen as demand continues to rise and more doctors leave the NHS,” said RCR president Dr Katharine Halliday.. Health systems across all four nations of the UK have been missing targets for cancer treatment since before the Covid pandemic.. The latest NHS data, from March, showed the proportion of patients in England waiting less than 62 days to receive their first cancer treatment was 69% against a target of 85%.. New analysis from Cancer Research UK has found that 382,000 cancer patients had not been treated within the prescribed time in England since December 2015, when the target was last met.. The charity is calling for the next government to draw up a long-term cancer strategy for England, with a plan to address shortages in the cancer workforce and increase capacity in the system.. “All political parties should commit to a long-term, fully-funded strategy to back cancer research across the UK, and improve and reform cancer services in England,” said the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, Michelle Mitchell.. “Without this, cancer patients will not receive the level of care that they deserve.”. NHS England says the number of patients waiting longer than 62 days for treatment is now the lowest it has been since April 2020, and it has been meeting another target, for diagnosing cancer or ruling it out within 28 days.. Rosemary Head, 83, from Langdon Hills in Essex, said she had to wait eight months to be diagnosed with lung cancer. . She had treatment on her tumour in January but has not yet been told the results, so has no idea if it was effective. . Her follow-up appointment has now been pushed back to October.. Her daughter Jackie said: ""I've seen my mother get to the point where she just can't deal with this anymore because it's so frustrating, and that really angers and upsets me."". The cancer charity Macmillan said NHS data shows ""far too many people"" are waiting too long for potentially life-saving scans and treatment.. Health is a devolved matter, with policies outside England set by ministers in the Scottish and Welsh governments, and the Northern Ireland executive, not Westminster.. However, decisions on NHS spending taken in Westminster trigger an automatic payment - or allocation - to the devolved administrations who must co-ordinate their policies accordingly.. In England:. The annual Walk for Wards event supports projects to make patients more comfortable. Luke Wilkinson says running became an ""outlet"" while caring for his parents during the pandemic.
. Alex Wysocki was 24 when he was diagnosed with EGFR-positive lung cancer and died weeks later.. Madi Foster says the success of the fundraiser means she can fly to America for treatment.. Christine Campbell has lived longer than doctors predicted - and she's determined to keep going.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,Sandy Hook survivors graduate from high school,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg33zqd5wyeo,2024-06-13 03:01:37,"More than a decade after a mass shooting in a quiet Connecticut suburb, a group of survivors from Sandy Hook Elementary School are graduating from high school.. Twenty students and six staff members were killed in the shooting on 14 December 2012.. The youngest among them were six years old.. A private ceremony was held on Wednesday evening at Newtown High School, which around 60 survivors attended.. Graduating students spoke of complex emotions surrounding the milestone.. ""The shooter actually came into my classroom. So I had to, like, watch all my friends and teachers get killed, and I had to run for my life at six years old,"" Emma Ehrens told CBS News, the BBC’s US partner.. ""Just growing up with having the fear, and the what-ifs of what could have happened if I stayed?” she said. “Because I was, like, I was going to be next."". Another survivor, Lilly Wasilnak, said: “You wait for this day for your whole life, since you're in kindergarten. You just can't wait to graduate. And it felt so far away for such a long time… but I think we can't forget about that there is a whole chunk of our class missing.”. A number of the survivors have volunteered for gun control groups and several met Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House last week.. The mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary was carried out by a 20-year-old armed with two rifles and a handgun. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot as police arrived on the scene.. The US president at the time, Barack Obama, later called it “the single darkest day of my presidency”.. Following the murders, Mr Obama proposed a large raft of new laws designed to curb gun violence. . Although he implemented a series of reforms to the US background check system using executive orders, two major pieces of legislation failed to pass Congress.. The laws would have banned assault rifles and instituted background checks on most private gun sales. They had bipartisan support, but most Republican senators along with a number of Democrats voted against the measures.. The Sandy Hook shooting remains the deadliest ever at a US primary school. . Since the attack, there have been more than 4,200 mass shootings in the United States, including several dozen at schools, CBS reported.. A spokeswoman declines to comment, though President Joe Biden has already said he will not pardon Hunter. . The story of the white buffalo is key to the religion of many Native American tribes in North America.. Some 300 black people were killed in the 1921 massacre - but nobody has been held responsible.. The US broadens Russia sanctions, including a fresh crackdown on banks and tech.. ""What if they were able to walk the stage with me?"" wonders one teenage survivor of the 2012 shooting..

bbc.com,Hodgkinson wins 800m gold despite illness,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cv22jjlqzxko,2024-06-12 19:40:07,"This video can not be played. European Athletics Championships 2024: Keely Hodgkinson wins 800m gold. Keely Hodgkinson defended her European 800m title with a dominant victory despite struggling with illness, as Great Britain also won women's 4x100m relay gold on the final night of action in Rome.. Hodgkinson, 22, led throughout and held off her rivals in the closing stages to win in one minute 58.65 seconds.. However, following her victory the Olympic and two-time world silver medallist revealed she had become unwell a day earlier.. ""Sometimes you’ve just got to find a way to win,"" Hodgkinson told BBC Sport.. ""I wanted to go out and get a good time today but I'm happy with the win. I think I would have been disappointed if I didn’t try."". In a golden conclusion to the six-day championships for the British team, the women's 4x100m relay quartet featuring Dina Asher-Smith, Desiree Henry, Amy Hunt and Daryll Neita also triumphed. . Led off by 100m champion Asher-Smith and brought home by 200m silver medallist Neita, they took victory in 41.91secs, ahead of France and the Netherlands.. Asher-Smith told BBC Sport: ""That felt amazing, we are definitely trying new things before the Olympic Games. Obviously, we are looking to absolutely do amazing in Paris."". Neita said: ""To finish the championships with a gold medal with these amazing ladies, it’s just an incredible feeling, really electric and I really have a good feeling going into Paris."". Those golds helped the British team finish third in the medal table, with four golds and 13 medals in total, as hosts Italy topped the final standings ahead of France.. Also at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday, there were golds for Sweden's pole vault world record-holder Armand Duplantis and Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen, as Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs and Dutch star Femke Bol shone for their relay teams.. This video can not be played. European Athletics Championships: Great Britain win women's 4x100m relay gold. This was Hodgkinson's second major outdoor title following success in Munich two years ago and comes before she targets a first global title at Paris 2024.. With both a personal best and season's best time more than three seconds faster than anyone else in the final, she could hardly have lined up as a stronger favourite to defend her European crown.. While she did not win by the margin perhaps expected - having run a world-leading time of 1:55.78 to beat world champion Mary Moraa in Eugene this year - Hodgkinson always appeared in control as she collected the eighth major medal of an already stunning senior career, which only started in 2021.. The supremely talented Briton has been pushing the world's best since contesting her first major championships at the Tokyo Olympics.. Following that stunning breakthrough silver at those Games three years ago and successive world silvers since, Hodgkinson's eyes are now fixed on gold in Paris, where she is once again expected to battle Moraa and American Olympic champion Athing Mu for global supremacy..

bbc.com,Buenos Aires rocked by clashes over Milei reforms,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c255zdlde92o,2024-06-13 06:10:21,"Argentina's Senate has narrowly approved President Javier Milei's controversial economic reform package, with the vote taking place as violent clashes raged between protesters and riot police outside Congress.. Demonstrators in Buenos Aires - who say the measures will hurt millions of Argentines - threw petrol bombs and stones, setting cars alight.. A number of people were reported injured, with local media describing the scene on Wednesday as a ""battlefield"".. The reforms, aimed at reviving the country's flagging economy, include declaring a state of economic emergency, cutting pensions and watering down labour rights.. Mr Milei, a right-wing economist, was elected in the midst of a deep economic crisis which he is still struggling to stem after six months in office.. Annual inflation is currently close to 300%, while more than half of Argentines are now living in poverty.. Mr Milei's ""shock"" measures are opposed by leftist political parties, labour unions and social organisations.. But the motion, which was initially tied 36-36 in the Senate, was preliminarily passed on Wednesday after the head of the chamber, Vice-President Victoria Villarruel, broke the tie.. ""For those Argentines who suffer, who wait, who do not want to see their children leave the country... my vote is affirmative,"" Ms Villaruel said after breaking the tie.. The 328-article bill will now be surveyed point by point before its expected full approval on Thursday. . It will then return to the lower house for the final go-ahead.. Ahead of the bill's passing in the Senate, protesters chanted: “The country is not for sale, the country is defended,"" while one banner read: “how can a head of state hate the state?”. Scuffles broke out when protesters tried to make their way towards Congress through fences, with demonstrators throwing rocks at officers who pepper sprayed them.. Observers and opposition MPs said dozens of demonstrators and a handful of MPs received medical attention. At least five opposition MPs in the crowd were hospitalised, legislator Cecilia Moreau told AFP news agency.. At least 20 police officers were also injured, officials said. Security forces said they arrested 15 people..  ""We cannot believe that in Argentina we are discussing a law that will put us back 100 years,"" Fabio Nunez, a 55-year-old protesting lawyer, was quoted by AFP as saying.. President Milei's office issued a statement thanking the security forces for repressing what it described as ""terrorists"" attempting to carry out a coup d'état.. “We are going to change Argentina, we are going to make it the most liberal country in the world,"" Mr Milei told a conference in Buenos Aires.. The highly divisive bill was approved by the lower house in April, after significant amendments were made to it.. Mr Milei came to office in 2023 after vowing to take a chainsaw to public spending.. While on the campaign trail, he even brandished a chainsaw while making a speech to symbolise his determination to do so.. He has since cut the cabinet in half, slashed 50,000 public jobs, suspended new public works contracts and ripped away fuel and transport subsidies.. Schools, banks and many shops close across the country, with train and metro services suspended.. The Argentine leader tells the BBC that the ""political caste"" is bearing the brunt of his reforms.. Stuffing your greenbacks into the ""mattress bank"" is a way of life for many Argentines.. The banking giant is set to take a billion-dollar loss by exiting Argentina after nearly 30 years.. The new president's radical measures to overhaul the economy are loved by some, loathed by others.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,G7 plans to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2203d44rlo,2024-06-13 06:56:41,"Leaders from seven of the world's richest nations are gathering in Italy for a summit expected to agree a plan to use frozen Russian assets to raise billions of dollars for Ukraine.. The US proposal could raise $50bn (£39bn) a year for Ukraine, as well as applying fresh economic pressure to Russia.. Also expected to be on the agenda at the G7 summit are the war in Gaza, migration, economic security and artificial intelligence (AI).. The summit comes as a number of leaders - including Rishi Sunak, Emmanuel Macron and Joe Biden - face electoral challenges back home.. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is down in the polls ahead of a general election next month.. Also facing the voters in a matter of weeks is the party of French President Emmanuel Macron, who called a snap parliamentary election after a resounding loss to the far-right National Rally in last weekend's elections to the EU's parliament.. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden themselves could face defeat the next time voters head to the polls.. Italy's Giorgia Meloni has boasted that her country was heading into this summit with “the strongest government of all”, after a strong performance in the European elections last weekend.. The US proposal for Ukraine would see Kyiv granted the money in a loan, secured by the interest on the $325bn of Russian assets that the group, alongside the EU, froze after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.. Under international law, countries cannot confiscate those assets from Russia and give them to Ukraine.. It is hoped that if passed, the plan would give cash-starved and war-weary Ukraine another vital lifeline.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to attend the conference and will sign a new security arrangement with the US.. With President Biden in the middle of a close election contest himself, and several other Western leaders lagging in the polls, there is pressure to deliver support to Ukraine while they still can.. Elsewhere, Mr Sunak is set to announce up to $309m in support for Ukraine's energy and humanitarian needs.. Before heading to Puglia, he said that allies had to be ""decisive and creative in our efforts to support Ukraine and end [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal war at this critical moment"".. But the shaky political situation in many G7 countries is causing some observers to have low expectations about what can be achieved.. Natalie Tocci, the director of the Italian Institute for International Affairs, warns that, “if anything will come out of this summit, it’s the fear of a catastrophe playing out before our eyes,” with possible new governments led by Donald Trump in the US and the far-right in France on the horizon.. Also on the agenda is the climate crisis, migration from Africa to Europe, the war in Gaza and AI.. Pope Francis - who will become the first pontiff to attend a G7 summit - will be addressing the subject of artificial intelligence at the conference.. He has previously called for global regulation of AI, warning of its danger to ethics and human rights.. PM Giorgia Meloni will welcome other world leaders to Puglia after election success for her party.. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the vote could have ""serious consequences"" for France.. Leaders of the G7, the world's richest nations, meet to discuss the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.. As France calls for a snap election, other European countries weigh their gains and losses.. The French leader lost to the far right then called an election, in one of many big stories across the EU.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,Taylor Swift fans make the earth move at Edinburgh gig,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgg81939g2o,2024-06-13 05:07:13,"Thousands of Taylor Swift fans made the earth move by cheering and dancing at her three Edinburgh concerts last weekend.. Fans took the singer's encouragement to Shake It Off literally, with monitoring stations detecting seismic activity from 6km (3.73 miles) away.. The energetic Swifties made the biggest commotion during three songs: Cruel Summer, Ready For It? and champagne problems.. And it seems the 73,000-strong Friday night crowd danced, cheered and stomped the loudest of the three gigs.. It marked the first of 17 UK dates for Swift, which will culminate in a record-breaking eight-night run at London’s Wembley Stadium.. The 152-date stadium tour is on track to make more than $2bn (£1.56bn) by the time it wraps up in December, making it the most lucrative concert tour in music history.. During her three Murrayfield performances, Swift played to 200,000 fans who came from all over the world to see her career-spanning, three-hour show.. The Friday night concert was the most energetic by a small margin with fans making the ground move a maximum of 23.4 newton-meters (nm), compared to 22.8nm and 23.3nm on the Saturday and Sunday respectively.. The seismic activity was mainly caused by dancing and reached its peak at 160bpm during Ready For It?. The Swifties created approximately 80kW of power during the song, equivalent to around 6,000 car batteries.. Shake It Off and Cruel Summer made the ground move, but detectors even shook during a four-minute long applause for champagne problems.. Swift's previous tour dates in Seattle and Los Angeles registered similar events, with her Seattle gig generating activity equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.. The British Geological Survey (BGS) is the UK's national earthquake monitoring agency and its detectors are sensitive enough to pick up the smallest seismic activity miles away.. Callum Harrison, BGS seismologist, said: ""It’s amazing that we’ve been able to measure the reaction of thousands of concert goers remotely through our data. . ""The opportunity to explore a seismic activity created by a different kind of phenomenon has been a thrill.. ""Clearly Scotland’s reputation for providing some of the most enthusiastic audiences remains well intact!"". The movement was detected at two monitoring stations, and the furthest away of which was 6km away at the BGS office at Heriot Watt University.. However experts said the movement generated by the concert was unlikely to have been felt by anyone other than those in the immediate vicinity.. The ""Swiftival"" is designed to bring a taste of the star's The Eras Tour to Long Sutton.. Fans, students and academics came together to analyse the star's songs ahead of the Eras tour arrival. . So make the friendship bracelets... have you secured tickets to see Taylor Swift in Cardiff?. Organisers of Harry Styles walking tours add an extra date due to ""overwhelming demand"" from Swifties.. There are travel disruption alerts as tens of thousands of fans get the party started with Pink.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,Musk says Tesla investors back his multi-billion dollar pay deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cleezyxjv4jo,2024-06-13 05:53:08,"Tesla boss Elon Musk says shareholder votes on a record-breaking payout to the multi-billionaire and a plan to move the firm's legal headquarters to Texas are ""currently passing by wide margins"".. Tesla shareholders have been voting on several proposals, including one that could confirm a pay deal for Mr Musk, that was worth $56bn (£43.8bn) when it was first agreed in 2018.. The company is due to make an official announcement on the result of the vote at a meeting on Thursday.. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News.. In a post on social platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Mr Musk thanked his supporters.. However, legal experts say it is not clear if a court that blocked the deal will accept the re-vote, which is not binding, and allow the company to restore the pay package.. Earlier this year, a Delaware judge voided the compensation deal after a small investor sued.. The judge ruled the sum was ""unfair"" and the process for determining the package, by a board dominated by Mr Musk, was ""deeply flawed"".. Tesla called the decision ""fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders"".. The company then submitted the deal to another vote - and asked its shareholders to back a plan to reincorporate the company outside the state of Delaware.. The board has said Mr Musk deserves the package because Tesla achieved its ambitious targets under his leadership and that it is necessary to ensure he remains dedicated to the company.. Tesla executives also expressed support for the package in social media posts, saying that Mr Musk is crucial to the company's success. . Meanwhile, Mr Musk promised a personal tour of Tesla's factory in Texas to some shareholders who cast votes.. The package - worth an estimated 300 times what the top-earning boss in the US made last year - won backing from 73% of shareholders who voted six years ago.. Three areas in Essex are particularly low on places to plug in a car, the council says.. How artificial intelligence is increasingly helping the arable farming sector.. The decision comes as an investigation continues into what the EU calls China’s ""unfair subsidisation"".. The company said it had sold all 75 million shares it had offered to investors..

bbc.com,'No closure' a year on from Nottingham attacks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjeeqzrlgl3o,2024-06-13 02:04:28,"A year since his father was stabbed to death by Valdo Calocane, Lee Coates says he is still bearing the trauma of that fateful day.. The 37-year-old has told the BBC his mental health was affected by the aftermath of the Nottingham attacks - which also claimed the lives of 19-year-old students Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber.. The son says he is still coming to terms with losing his father Ian.. He and the families of the other victims have vowed to continue their ""pursuit for justice"" on a day where a number of events are planned across the city to mourn their loss.. ""I was getting - I don’t know if you call it PTSD - but I’d close my eyes and all I could envision was what happened that night,"" he said.. ""You can’t help but let that run through your head and how your dad was left lying there."". The 37-year-old said he thought he could start ""dealing with the grief"" after Calocane's trial but said he ""didn't get any closure"".. ""I think after that, that’s where it started affecting me a lot more and I could see it really got to my mental health."" . Calocane was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. . The CPS said medical experts provided ""overwhelming"" evidence that he was suffering from a serious mental health condition at the time of the attacks. . His sentence was challenged by the victims' families but judges ruled in May that it was not unduly lenient, after the attorney general referred it to the Court of Appeal for review.. Mr Coates's youngest son said he had been ""very, very angry"" but is now in a better place, adding: “I never thought about my dad every day before. I definitely do think about him everyday now. . ""So before I leave my apartment, there’s a picture of my dad and I kind of [tell myself] 'I’m going to do you proud', like he did me proud.”. On Thursday, Huntingdon Academy in St Ann's, where Mr Coates worked as caretaker, is hosting a special day in his memory. . His son said: ""He wouldn’t want his name on anything. He’s very quiet, he likes to be that background character, that just makes sure everyone else is alright."" . He added that the love he and his family had received from the city had helped ""more than words ever could"".. ""I think if my dad was looking down as well, he'd also have a little tear in his eye."" . By Olimpia Zagnat, BBC Nottingham. The city centre had an eerie feel on 13 June last year, when I arrived to find the Victoria shopping centre completely blocked off by police cars and fire crews.. It was about seven o’clock in the morning and you could sense something very serious had happened. . For a moment it seemed like the clocks had stopped ticking – with no trams or buses running and rush hour traffic unable to get through.. Everyone who became stranded in the city centre left on foot, power-walking to work or school.. The shocking scenes in our city made national news before we even knew what was really going on - and then the more we learned about it, the worse it got.. Our shock and worry soon turned into grief, and thousands of us descended to Old Market Square to pay our tributes to Barnaby, Grace and Ian.. It’s a day we – all the people of Nottingham – will never forget.. Marking a year on from the Nottingham attacks, the families will walk down Ilkeston Road, where Miss O'Malley-Kumar and Mr Webber were fatally stabbed, and lay flowers. . A ceremony will also be held at the University of Nottingham. . Shearer West, Vice-Chancellor at the university, said:  “We came together as a community last year when this terrible event happened and I think it’s really important we come together again. . ""I’m really proud of the way our university community did come together last year and I think we need to be able to remember our great students Barney and Grace one year on.”. Meanwhile, the families of the victims say they have accepted the support of legal experts as they await the outcomes of further investigations into the case.. After a review into how the CPS handled the case, the victims' families called for changes to homicide laws, and have maintained the case was poorly handled. . In a statement released on Thursday, the families said the anniversary was ""not the day for a fight"", but vowed to continue going forward. . The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating Nottinghamshire Police and Leicestershire Police in relation to their separate involvement with Calocane.. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) is due to publish a further report into inpatient mental health services at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust this summer. . In a joint statement on Thursday, the families of the victims said: ""Today we will take time and pause to reflect upon that tragic day and remember the souls of the three vibrant, caring, hard-working and much loved family members who are no longer here..

""We continue in our dogged pursuit for appropriate justice, individual and organisational accountability and real lasting change to our society and laws that will provide more protection and public safety, appropriate punishment for crimes and proper support for victims and their families."".

bbc.com,Sunak aide admits placing bet on general election before it was announced,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722eyxxknro,2024-06-12 18:19:32,"A senior aide to Rishi Sunak has admitted that the Gambling Commission are making inquiries after he reportedly placed a bet on the date of the general election.. Tory candidate Craig Williams, who was the prime minister's Parliamentary Private Secretary in the last Parliament, said he would cooperate with the probe.. In a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, he said: ""I've been contacted by a journalist about Gambling Commission inquiries into one of my accounts and thought it best to be totally transparent.. ""I put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago. This has resulted in some routine inquiries and I confirm I will fully cooperate with these.. ""I don't want to be a distraction from the campaign, I should have thought through how it looked."". According to the Guardian, Mr Williams - who is standing for election in Montgomeryshire & Glyndwr - placed a £100 bet on a July election just three days before Mr Sunak named 4 July as the date. . The newspaper reported that the bet could have led to a payout of £500, following the election in July.. The BBC has not yet been able to verify that he placed a bet on the election date but has contacted Mr Williams for a comment.. Labour called the allegations ""utterly extraordinary"".. Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said the prime minister should suspend Mr Williams immediately as a candidate and Conservative member while inquiries take place.. ""Voters are being taken for granted by Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives"", she added.. A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said they are ""aware of contact between a Conservative candidate and the Gambling Commission"" but say that it is a ""a personal matter for the individual in question"".. ""As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded,” they said.. A Gambling Commission spokesperson said it does not ""confirm or deny whether any investigations are underway unless or until they are concluded, or if arrests are made or charges are brought during a criminal investigation."". The spokesperson also said that the confidential use of information in order to gain an unfair advantage when betting ""may constitute an offence of cheating under Section 42 of the Gambling Act, which is a criminal offence"".. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said: “These allegations are utterly extraordinary."" . He claimed Rishi Sunak had ""sat on this information for more than a week but has lacked any backbone to take action"". .

bbc.com,Valance and Wintour host rival Trump-Biden London events,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxee43mdd60o,2024-06-13 01:01:57,"The US election campaign came to London on Wednesday evening, with an Aussie pop star and the editor of Vogue hosting rival fundraising events to reel in thousands of dollars in donations.. Holly Valance, the former Neighbours actress who topped the pop charts in the early 2000s, was expected to host the pro-Donald Trump event in West London at which ticket prices started at $10,000 (£7,800), one guest told the BBC. . Vogue’s editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, meanwhile, hosted a fundraiser in support of Joe Biden's campaign, a Biden campaign official confirmed. Tickets were said to cost $1,000 each.. Only US citizens and permanent residents were able to make donations.. Donald Trump's son, Donald Jr, was among the guests at the Republican fundraiser. He said afterwards it had been “incredible” and had raised lots of money, CBS News reported.. Asked about the Hunter Biden guilty verdict, he said it was a ""decoy to cover up all the actual corruption that was going on in that administration"".. Trump's ally Nigel Farage, the Reform UK party leader, also attended the event. . Greg Swenson, the chairman of Republicans Overseas, confirmed to the BBC that tickets cost from $10,000-$100,000. . For dinner, it was $50,000 per couple. Mr Swenson acknowledged it was a ""big-ticket"" event, but insisted the Republicans were the ""party of the people"" and highlighted the entry fees for rival Democratic events. . The most expensive tickets for one of Mr Biden's events in New York in March cost half a million dollars each.. Speaking before the fundraiser, Mr Swenson said he would be ""surprised"" if Trump Sr did not make a virtual appearance, having been at other events at which the ex-president ""chimes in"".. The London location was near the Chelsea Embankment in an exclusive area. At the door, a man in a suit and umbrella welcomed guests dropped off in front of polished black gates on Wednesday.  . The property’s website describes the venue as a “hub for entertainment and relaxation”, including wine cellar, swimming pool, spa and IMAX cinema.. Not everyone at the site felt warmly toward Trump, however - a woman with an American accent shouted “vote Biden” from a building nearby.. Trump has lagged behind his rival in fundraising efforts during the race so far, but his recent conviction in a New York hush-money trial prompted donations of tens of millions of dollars, according to his campaign team. . The party was ""killing it with small donations"", Mr Swenson said, after Americans were left ""shocked at the justice system"".. Valance, 41, is perhaps better known to millions in Britain and Australia for her 2002 song Kiss Kiss, and its racy video that took the pop world by storm. . She been linked to Mr Farage and Trump since being pictured alongside the two politicians in 2022, along with her entrepreneur husband Nick Candy.. There was no immediate response to a BBC request for comment that was sent to the Candy Foundation, the couple's charity.. Few details were available about the rival Democratic event hosted by Anna Wintour.. The timing of the rival London events was pure coincidence, insisted Sharon Manitta, global press secretary for Democrats Abroad. . Ms Manitta said her organisation - which operates separately from the Biden campaign - had organised a further event, a comedy night in Greenwich, for which tickets were selling for the more modest sum of $60.. ""We figure we need a bit of comedy now in this craziness,"" she told the BBC.. PM Giorgia Meloni will welcome other world leaders to Puglia after election success for her party.. A spokeswoman declines to comment, though President Joe Biden has already said he will not pardon Hunter. . Mr Garland becomes the third attorney general in US history to be held in contempt of Congress.. The high-profile case heard details of family turmoil caused by the drug addiction of the president's son. . The trial dredged up a dark chapter in Hunter Biden's life.

The test takes 45 minutes, compared with three days using traditional methods. . The original work was done by Swedish researchers and the test is now being sold by the company Sysmex Astrego.. The Longitude Prize - with a financial reward nearly 10 times that of a Nobel - was inspired by a contest in 1714.. It was won by John Harrison, who developed a precise clock allowing sailors to pinpoint their position at sea - one of the greatest challenges of the 18th Century.. Fast forward 300 years - and the modern blight of superbugs was the focus. . Infections that resist the drugs used to treat them are estimated to kill more than a million people every year. It is known as the silent pandemic. . “Without antibiotics, modern medicine as we know it is in real danger of collapse,"" UK special envoy on antimicrobial resistance Dame Sally Davies says.. Every time an antibiotic is used creates an opportunity for bacteria in the body to evolve resistance to it. . Resistance gives those bacteria a survival advantage and they spread, which is why the life-saving drugs should be used only when it is certain they will work.. The test works in urinary tract infections, which affect most women at some point and account for a fifth of antibiotics prescribed in England. . When the patient first arrives in hospital, or at a doctor's surgery, it is not easy to tell if their infection is caused by bacteria, viruses or even fungi.. Doctors can send a sample to a clinical microbiology laboratory - but this means growing the bacteria on a petri dish and can take three days to reveal the cause and which antibiotics the infection may be susceptible to.. In the meantime, antibiotic treatment is often started anyway because of the risk of symptoms becoming much worse or even causing sepsis. . The prize-winning test, however, reveals within 15 minutes whether the infection is bacterial - and within 45 minutes, which antibiotics work.. It starts with a urine sample, which is squirted into a cartridge containing tiny doses of five different antibiotics and placed inside a machine. . Any bacteria are forced - in single file - into one of thousands of channels inside the cartridge. . The machine then uses microscopy to monitor how any bacteria grow in the presence of the different drugs. . And the antibiotics that lead to little or no growth are the most likely to work.. A panel of 17 experts chose the winner from more than 250 entries.. Prof Johan Elf, from Uppsala University, said they had been working on measurement technology when the prize had been announced, a decade ago. . They then realised their work ""could be really useful in the fight against antimicrobial resistance"" and began working on the test. . Sysmex Astrego said it was rolling out the test in Europe and running studies in the UK.. ""The £8m prize will support us to tailor the test for use with different kinds of UTIs and antibiotics, speeding up access for more patients,” one of the company's founders, Mikael Olsson, said.. Dame Sally said the winner ""lays the groundwork for a sea-change in how we manage these precious medicines"" and rapid tests would mean patients received the ""right drug, first time”.. The technology is not currently recommended for use in the NHS, however.. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is still monitoring the difference it makes to patients and its cost-effectiveness.. Meanwhile, Prof Laura Piddock, from the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, said it would be a ”game-changer” only in rich countries that could afford it, while antimicrobial resistance was a global problem that was ""worse"" than when the prize had been announced. . In 1714, the UK government's Longitude Act offered £20,000 to whoever could solve the challenge of working out how far east or west ships at sea were.. This required knowing the time on board as well as back at home - each four-minute time difference means one degree of longitude.  . The ship's time could be set using the height of the Sun each day - but the ocean waves and the humidity would disrupt the delicate mechanisms in the clock trying to keep time back in port.  . Harrison, a self-taught clockmaker from Yorkshire, solved the problem but then battled the establishment for years to be deemed the winner. . The latest Longitude Prize was run by Challenge Works, a part of the innovation agency Nesta.. ""When there is a challenge of gargantuan proportions in desperate need of real-world solutions, prizes attract the brightest minds to solve the problem,"" Challenge Works managing director Tris Dyson said.. Another Longitude Prize, worth £4.4m, has now been announced - to help people in the earliest stages of dementia live independently.. Follow James on X, formerly known as Twitter.. .

bbc.com,Green Party manifesto: 11 key policies analysed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czddq40z2zno,2024-06-12 19:15:01,"The Green Party of England and Wales have launched their 2024 election manifesto. The document sets out what the party's plans would be, should it win the election on 4 July.. Here BBC correspondents have analysed the main pledges.. The cash injection being promised by the Greens into the NHS is huge. In the first year, they say they will increase the budget in England by £8bn. It is currently £165bn. And by 2030 there will be £28bn more. There will be more for public health too, delivered by councils.. To put that into context, the Liberal Democrats are only promising £8bn a year more for health by the end of the Parliament, while the Conservatives have limited their promises to above inflation increases.. The Green Party manifesto promises quicker access to NHS dentistry and GPs and reductions in the hospital waiting list. But the money will also be needed for one of its more unique proposals: a commitment to restore pay for junior doctors. That requires a 35% pay increase, something none of the other parties seem prepared to do.. Health is devolved so these policies would apply to England only.. The Green Party manifesto proposes to raise up to £151bn a year in new taxes by 2029. This would be a very large increase, equal to around 4.5% of GDP. . One of the big components of this is a new tax on the weathy, which they say would raise about £15bn. This would be levied at 1% a year on the assets of people with more than £10m and 2% on those with more than £1bn. . Some tax experts are doubtful this would raise as much as the Greens’ costings suggest, saying many wealthier people who are resident in the UK have only tenuous ties with the UK and could leave to avoid it. . However, Arun Advani of Warwick University, who was part of the Wealth Tax Commission, judges the idea of raising a sum from a wealth tax similar to that claimed by the Greens  to be “economically credible”.. This would apply to the whole of the UK. . The Green Party’s proposal on National Insurance is to charge the basic 8% rate on income above what’s called the Upper Earnings Limit. . If you pay higher-rate tax at 40% on some of your pay, you are in a small minority of the population who earn more than the higher-rate threshold of £50,270 a year. It is currently about 5.8 million people out of the total population of 67 million – less than a tenth.. It is a minority that’s expanding rapidly because of the 2021 decision to freeze income tax and National Insurance thresholds so that they do not rise in line with earnings or inflation. Since then, wages have risen rapidly but the thresholds haven’t, dragging more and more taxpayers above them to pay a higher rate of tax. Had those thresholds risen as before, there would now be only 3.9 million people exposed to the Green Party’s proposal – a little over a tenth of the workforce.. But instead there are now 5.8 million – about 15%. And that is set to grow to 6.7 million, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. The Greens say that if you earn £55,000, the additional amount you pay under their proposals would be less than £6 per week and if you earn £65,000, it would be about £17 a week.. This would apply to the whole of the UK. . The Greens are making a renewed pledge to scrap university tuition fees.. The party say they would “fully fund” every student and bring back maintenance grants. It is an expensive promise. It also comes at a time when universities are worried about their finances. Fees for UK students haven’t kept up with costs, and the number of higher-paying international students is predicted to fall.. The party says it would scrap “high-stakes testing” in schools and abolish their regulator, Ofsted. And there is a pledge to boost funding for schools by £8bn, including £2bn for teachers’ pay.. Spending per pupil currently sits, in real terms, at around the same level it did in 2010. With schools’ costs projected to rise by 4% in 2024 and teachers’ pay for September at the top of the next education secretary’s to-do list, head teachers will be keen to dig into the detail.. Education is devolved so these policies would only apply in England. The Green Party say they want to reach net zero – when the UK is adding no additional greenhouse gases to the atmosphere – by 2040 at the latest. That is, most analysts would agree, an extremely ambitious target.. By comparison, the Conservatives and Labour both aim to get to net zero by 2050.  The Lib Dems and SNP have set a 2045 target while the Reform Party says it will scrap the ambition completely.. But getting to net zero will be even more challenging for the Greens because unlike the other parties, they want to phase out nuclear power, currently about 15% of the UK’s electricity.. The Greens say they will achieve their goal thanks in large part to a huge rollout of renewable power. They propose a big expansion of offshore wind, as do the main parties. Where the Greens plan to go significantly further is with a massive growth in onshore wind and solar power. But that would likely generate strong local opposition. Many communities do not like to see solar panels covering farmland or wind turbines sprouting on hillsides.. This would apply to the whole of the UK. . The Green Party say they would invest £5bn in community sports, art and culture in England over five years, and remove VAT from cultural activities across the UK. But there is no detail on where that money would come from.. On media policy, the Greens want to tighten laws so that no individual or company owns more than 20% of a media market. This comes after a Saudi Arabian businessman bought a 30% stake in Independent Digital News and Media, the owners of the Independent, in 2017.. The party also wants to move forward with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards - that investigation to explore the relationship between journalists and the police has never happened. Neither the Conservatives nor Labour support proceeding, although the Liberal Democrats also put it in their manifesto. Campaigners who demand what they call a “free and accountable press” say it is vital.. The Greens have also proposed a Digital Bill of Rights that takes a cautionary approach to AI that would be in alignment with Europe and other international bodies.. The Greens call for sweeping reforms of Britain’s defence and foreign policies but the radicalism is often tempered by some more mainstream positions. The party would dismantle Britain’s entire Trident nuclear deterrent and remove all foreign nuclear weapons from UK soil. But the party would also keep the UK in the Nato military alliance, saying it has “an important role in ensuring the ability of its member states to respond to threats to their security”.. On the war in Gaza, the Greens would end UK military co-operation with Israel, reinstate funding for a UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and support international investigations into war crimes’ allegations against Israel. But it would also push for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and a long-term settlement to bring security to both sides.. The Greens would re-join the EU “as soon as the domestic political situation is favourable”. But it would seek to re-enter the Customs Union first and restore the free movement of people, especially students.. Naturally, much of their global focus is on climate change. The party would spend 1% of national income on foreign aid and 1.5% on climate finance. But like a rising number of countries in the West, its focus would be on giving emerging economies a greater say over how the money is spent.. This would apply to the whole of the UK.. The Green Party's plan of “investing to mend” includes an additional £20bn to tackle the crisis in adult social care. It is a big chunk of money, so inevitably there will be questions about whether the sums add up, and whether the country could afford that level of spending.. The Greens claim increasing taxes on the wealthiest and a carbon tax would raise up to £150bn a year to fund a range of promises. The party argue that putting more into early support for older and disabled people at home or in care homes would take pressure off the NHS.. Like the Lib Dems, they would make personal care free - so that is support with daily tasks like washing, dressing and medication. It would be similar to the system already operating in Scotland. The care system is struggling with increasing demand and staff shortages, so it is notable that these two smaller parties have made investing in social care an important part of their manifesto offers.. In contrast, the two main parties have had remarkably little to say on the subject so far.. Social care is devolved so these policies would apply to England only.. The Green Party says “we need to reduce how much we fly, and we need to do it fairly”. What this means in practice is a frequent flyer levy “to reduce the impact of the 15% of people who take 70% of the flights” and a stop to all airport expansion plans.. The party will also ban domestic flights for journeys that would take less than three hours by train and would also make airlines pay VAT on jet fuel - at the moment they do not pay any VAT on kerosene.. The Greens also plans an economy-wide carbon tax – a charge on any activities that produce carbon dioxide – that they say would also apply to airlines.. Some of these policies may sound a little familiar. The Lib Dem manifesto also contained a commitment to impose a levy on frequent fliers, to ban the shortest-haul flights and restrict airport expansion.. Two key elements of the Green Party’s housing policy seem to be lifted from the party’s experience of being in government in Scotland until April. Any MPs elected for the Greens will campaign for councils to be allowed to impose rent controls as well as banning no-fault evictions. In Scotland, the SNP/Green coalition introduced a 3% rent cap for private tenancies and a moratorium on evictions, with limited exceptions.  . Rent controls are popular with tenants but landlords argue they lead to fewer, poorer quality homes being available as owners can not afford to invest. The Conservatives also promised to ban no-fault evictions, but failed to get the legislation passed before Parliament was dissolved.. The Greens also promised to campaign to build 150,000 social homes a year in England and end Right to Buy. Building that number of social homes has not been achieved for decades; between 2019 and 2023 for instance, just 30,000 homes for social rent were built across England.. Housing is devolved so these policies would only apply in England.. The Greens say they will nationalise the companies that run our railways, our water companies and the big five energy companies. That has long been their policy, but sounds a lot less outspoken now than it might have done a few years ago.. Following Margaret Thatcher’s privatisations of British Steel, British Petroleum and British Airways, John Major’s government of 1990-1997 continued with the coal industry, energy industry and British Rail. Accepting the view that privatisation meant efficiency, Labour PMs Tony Blair and Gordon Brown embraced similar principles with the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), under which the government had contracts with the private sector finance to build and maintain hospitals, prisons and roads. The 2010-2015 Tory-Lib Dem coalition government continued to privatise.. Since then, some poorly run private companies have been propped up with public money to stop them going bust, from Railtrack, the company that owned the railway lines, to LNER and Southeastern train operators more recently. In 2022/23 the government spent about £67bn subsidising energy companies to charge lower bills, something they could not have done without the government. . Water companies have been criticised for extracting big dividends while failing to invest, resulting in sewage leaks. And PFI, condemned by MPs as providing poor value for money for the taxpayer, was ditched by Theresa May’s government in 2018.. First time voters in Felixstowe share their key issues as the general election campaign gathers pace..

bbc.com,Are young people forced out of Wales to find work?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl44md3zj81o,2024-06-13 05:08:28,"Conor Fagan is living the dream.. While many of his friends chose to work in trades, he wanted something else and, at the age of 23, owns his own watersport business on a beach on Anglesey.. If he had not chosen his own path, how easy would it be for him to find work nearby, in the current economic climate?. He believes there are career options in the area, but ""obviously there's less opportunity for people that want to earn more money in the area here"".. Conor believes living on Anglesey means people have to ""apply themselves a little bit more,"" in order to find higher-paid work, much more than those in larger towns and cities.. He added: ""I'm very fortunate in that I have my own business here, so I can afford to live here. . ""But a lot of my friends and peers, maybe not so much, and they do have to move away to find a better career path to be able to sustain living here."" . Edward Altoft, 18, is one of Conor's part-time watersports instructors at Funsport in Rhosneigr.. But later this year the first-time voter will leave sixth form and study engineering at university in England.. Asked if he would like to return to work on Anglesey, he said: ""100% yeah. I'd want to stay here the rest of my life if I could. It's perfect for me, I love it.. ""But if there's not the job for me here - which I don't really think there is at the moment for engineering - then I'll have to move inwards and come here on holiday."". He said work for people interested in trade and hospitality was good on the island, but with colleges ""pushing you to go into jobs such as finance, engineering, things like that"", it was ""super difficult round here to find jobs like that"".. Fellow sixth-former Osian Buckland, 18, works part-time at Funsport.. He is about to leave sixth form to study sports science at university, and said people in the area would ""struggle to get further up"" than hospitality or labour.. ""I'd like to stay here forever but there isn't the right jobs. It'd be much easier for a lot of people to move into a city and get a job there.. ""My aim's definitely to come back here and hopefully I can find something for me."". Graduate Nadine Moore, 28, is Funsport's manager and loves her job but has friends from the area who have moved across the border to find work in England.. She said she would worry too if she was forced to look for work: ""I do think to stay in the area I'd potentially struggle to go down a career path that I'd really want to do.. ""I think for myself I would either look at moving a little bit more inland and towards a city."". Just up the road from Funsport, Becky Bevan, 27, who owns Cafe Notos in Rhosneigr, said she would not want to be job hunting now.. ""I think it would be difficult, and I say that from a place where I've been there. Just after Covid, I was like 'what am I going to do?'. ""I've got a degree, I moved back here - exactly in the position that lots of people are in in their 20s....what am I going to do for work?. Becky believes the desire for well-paid work means ""a lot of young people are moving away, and I don't know if necessarily a lot of them are coming back either,"" because of high house prices.. We can see there has been steady trend of net migration out of Anglesey for young people aged 15 to 29.. Ynys Mon also has the third lowest proportion of this age group of all Welsh parliamentary constituencies.. Young or talented people leaving for better pay - or brain drain - is not unique to the island - Wales has a pattern of net migration of 15 to 29-year-olds leaving for other parts of the UK.. Health and social care is the sector employing the most people in Wales, followed by retail.. There is a similar picture at a local level on Anglesey, which has proportionately more people than average working in the hospitality, construction and farming industries.. There are fewer opportunities in manufacturing, however.. Anglesey has one of the highest employment rates in Wales, which saw more than 77% in a job, for the working age population, at the end of last year.. Huw Brassington, from Llandwrog, Gwynedd, is a senior mechanical engineer who himself relocated from Wales to Cumbria in order find a suitable job.. He now works with Tenet Consultants, which provides engineering designs for large-scale projects including nuclear and renewables.. The company recently opened an office on Anglesey, which he heads, and he says the company is focused on providing well-paid jobs and encouraging skilled workers back to Wales.. The former lecturer said: ""I understand the challenges faced by young engineers in north Wales first-hand. . ""I witnessed many eager and talented students with limited opportunities. Despite their potential, only a handful secured apprenticeships. . ""I have remained in contact with many of my former students and am now striving to recruit them.. ""Many excel in their careers but often face long commutes or permanent relocation. One of my best former students, for example, commutes from Bala to Bristol weekly."". Stopping brain-drain, he said, ""requires a long-term strategy"" to ""start cultivating our engineers of the future"".. On the economy and employment, the Welsh Liberal Democrats said they would ""offer something different from the current status quo and that is a fair deal that will deliver a strong economy through investment, fair taxes, and responsible management of the public finances"".. The Welsh Conservatives said a strong economy ""delivers strong public services"", but added ""Labour has no plan to grow Wales’ economy, to get people into work, to boost wages for Welsh workers or to support Welsh businesses"".. Labour said: ""The Welsh Labour government is focused on protecting Welsh jobs,  getting people out of poverty and addressing the Tory-made cost of living crisis,"" but said it had been ""compromised by a Conservative government"" in Westminster.. Plaid Cymru and Reform have been asked to comment. . First time voters in Felixstowe share their key issues as the general election campaign gathers pace..

bbc.com,How could global turmoil affect the election in Scotland?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clddgxgg12vo,2024-06-13 05:06:40,"It's nearly five years since the United Kingdom last went to the polls in a general election and a lot has happened in that time.. Three events in particular will have their own lengthy entries in the history books.. The global pandemic, the UK's departure from the European Union, and the war in Ukraine have had deep and lasting effects on life and politics in Scotland and further afield.. What impact might they have on the outcome of this election?. Scotland's first coronavirus death was confirmed in March 2020. Just 10 months later the UK registered more than 1,500 deaths with Covid-19 in a single day.. Politicians responded to this unprecedented public health emergency by introducing the most extreme restrictions on our liberty ever known in peacetime.. Whatever the rights and wrongs of lockdowns - which were supported by all four big UK parties - the publicly-funded National Health Service is still feeling the effects of that period.. As much routine healthcare was suspended to prioritise tackling the virus, the number of people waiting for treatment, and the length of time they were waiting, soared.. With their treatment delayed, many patients became sicker, with some developing additional conditions.. That piled further pressure on the NHS, which is actually four separate systems, currently administered by the Conservatives in England; the Scottish National Party in Scotland; Labour in Wales; and the power-sharing government of Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in Northern Ireland. . For all four governments, the pandemic highlighted existing problems.. ""Critical underlying issues were brutally exposed with too few staff, too few beds, and buildings that were unsuitable for effective infection control,"" according to doctors' trade union, the British Medical Association (BMA).. In Scotland, a recent official audit pointed out that waiting times standards were often missed before the pandemic, adding that soaring costs, long waits, and staff shortages were now having ""a direct impact on patient safety"".. The Audit Scotland report concluded that the NHS and its workforce were ""unable to meet the growing demand for health services,"" and accused the Scottish government of having ""no overall vision"" for the future delivery of healthcare.. The Scottish government has defended its Covid recovery plan and the new Scottish health secretary, Neil Gray, insists he will take a ""pragmatic"" approach to repairing the 76-year-old institution. . Because of devolution, the outcome of this election will not directly determine policy on health, education or other devolved areas such as housing or transport.. However, that does not mean such issues are irrelevant in this campaign.. Although the Scottish government decides how to allocate its resources (a limited amount of which it raises itself through taxation) the level of most of its budget, known as the block grant, is determined by Westminster.. If the UK government cuts spending on, say, criminal justice in England, then Scotland's overall budget will fall by a related amount.. Perhaps voters will take that into account when they go to the polls on 4 July, or maybe they will use the occasion to pass judgment on any number of Covid-related matters, from public sector procurement scandals to rows about deleted messages to parties during lockdown.. Some may want to make a much wider point about the overall system within which the NHS is run, whether that is to support Scotland's 317-year-old union with England, or to signal a desire for Scotland to become independent.. In other words, it’s pointless for any commentator to proclaim that the election is about this but not about that. What it is about is a matter for each voter.. The second big change since the last general election happened an hour before midnight on 31 January 2020.. That was the moment the UK formally left the European Union, 47 years after joining its predecessor trading bloc, the European Economic Community (EEC).. In a 2016 referendum on membership, Scotland and Northern Ireland voted by wide margins to remain in the EU while more populous England, along with Wales, voted narrowly to leave, setting the entire UK on a course for exit.. The Office for Budget Responsibility, a UK government body which provides independent economic analysis and forecasts, estimates that the UK's departure will, in the long run, cut both imports and exports by 15% and reduce productivity (output per worker) by 4%.. The Scottish government says that ""equates to £3bn in lost public revenues for Scotland, each and every year."". The Conservative UK government says Brexit frees up the country to strike its own trade deals, take back control of its laws, and set its own immigration limits.. Both the Conservatives and Labour say they have no intention of revisiting the result of the referendum. . In their manifesto, the Liberal Democrats vow to “fix the UK’s broken relationship with Europe”. That includes a pledge to seek to rejoin the Single Market, with a “longer-term objective” of rejoining the EU.. The SNP say Scotland should rejoin the EU as an independent nation, a proposal which is itself the subject of intense debate.. For now, the topic of immigration is another clear dividing line between, on the one hand the SNP and the Liberal Democrats, who both favour a more liberal approach, and, on the other, Labour and the Tories, who are more restrictive,. On Friday's BBC election debate, the SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn argued that migration was essential for Scottish public services, businesses, and economic growth.. Mr Flynn pointed to last month's release of census data which revealed that ""without migration, Scotland’s population would have decreased,"" with fewer workers to support an ageing population.. Critics of the current level of immigration into the UK as too high say it has put intolerable strain on public services such as housing, schools and healthcare.. The Conservatives say they will cut immigration, which has risen sharply since the last election, and will press ahead with attempts to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, to try to deter people from making the dangerous crossing of the English Channel in small boats.. Labour says it will reduce the need for immigration by improving the training of British workers.. Russian president Vladimir Putin's decision to order an invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sent shockwaves through a global economy which was already struggling to cope with a surge in demand for imported products as lockdowns were lifted and trading resumed.. As Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia, oil and gas prices soared, and supplies of wheat, sunflower oil and other products from the region were disrupted.. The global effect was to turbo charge inflation, pushing up the price of energy, food and mortgages, and leading to ""a widespread fall in household incomes.”. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says 12 million people in the UK are now living in absolute poverty and this parliament ""is on course to be the worst on record for growth in average incomes."". At a global level the economic impact was a ""catastrophe"" for some of the poorest citizens on earth, according to the World Bank.. But even before all three world-shaking events — the war, the pandemic, and Brexit — there were serious concerns about the underlying state of the UK economy.. Productivity had slumped following both the financial crisis of 2007/8 and the cuts to public spending, known as austerity, which were Tory chancellor George Osborne's response to it.. The brief tenure of prime minister Liz Truss also contributed to the economic turmoil.. Together, all of these shifts in the political and economic landscape over the past five years or so pose many challenges for the big parties at this election.. The SNP say we are now living in ""broken Brexit Britain,"" with a disastrous combination of entrenched low growth, low productivity and high inequality, from which independence can provide an escape route.. But if leaving the EU was so damaging, why would leaving the UK not be disruptive too, leading to public spending cuts, tax rises, or both, at least in the first decade of a fledging Scottish state?. In any case the power to allow a second referendum on independence lies with Westminster, where both Labour and the Tories continue to insist they will block another vote.. The Conservatives say Rishi Sunak has guided the nation through tough times with a clear plan, and the economy is now improving.. But with annual growth still weak in historical terms, government debt still high, and living standards under severe pressure, is that credible?. Labour are promising ""change"" which they say means Sir Keir Starmer would stabilise the economy by sticking to Tory spending constraints while keeping “taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible."". But could Sir Keir actually deliver meaningful change, given the state of the economy and his self-imposed constraints, which include, to the frustration of Scottish Labour, retaining some Tory curbs on welfare benefits?. The Liberal Democrats say they want to see a new industrial strategy and to repair the UK's ""broken relationship with Europe."". But even if there were the appetite in the UK at large, and among MPs in particular, to restructure the Brexit deal, why would Brussels agree to do so?. Politicians of all stripes are scrambling for answers and struggling to adapt to the dramatic changes the world has witnessed since the last general election.. First time voters in Felixstowe share their key issues as the general election campaign gathers pace.. Plaid Cymru's manifesto calls for the Welsh Parliament to have more funding for public transport.. What does the future hold for Ipswich town centre? Shoppers, traders and transport bosses react..

bbc.com,Starmer faces questions on tax and trust as Sunak grilled on D-Day and immigration,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0xx5le1qwxo,2024-06-12 21:54:31,"Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer have faced tough questions from an audience in Grimsby Town Hall, as part of a TV election programme on Sky News. . Keir Starmer defended backing Jeremy Corbyn in the 2019 general election by saying he knew Labour was going to lose.. And when pressed on his plan to remove VAT tax breaks from private schools, the Labour leader said he wanted to tackle a lack of resources in state schools. . Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he appreciated people's frustrations with the government as he acknowledge that levels of tax and immigration were ""too high"". . He also apologised again for leaving the D-Day commemorations early and for Covid rule-breaking in government.. Responding to a disgruntled former Conservative activist who said she felt ""ashamed"" of the government, Mr Sunak said he was trying to rebuild trust through his actions and by ""making progress on the things that matter to people"" such as economic stability.. Asked for a fact about himself that might make people ""like him more"", he said he had an ""appalling diet"" which included Haribo sweets and Twixes.. The prime minister faced more hostile heckling from the audience, particularly when talking about the NHS waiting lists.. Sir Keir also faced tricky moments, particularly when one audience member complained he did not answer questions and compared the Labour leader to a ""political robot"".. After a brief pause and audience laughter, Sir Keir talked about his former roles working with the police in Northern Ireland and in the Crown Prosecution Service saying there's been a ""constant theme in my life of trying to serve the public"".. He was repeatedly asked why he backed Jeremy Corbyn in the general election 2019 but was now disparaging the former leader. . Sir Keir said he was ""certain that we would lose the 2019 election"" and that he campaigned for Labour because he wanted ""good colleagues"" to keep their seats in Parliament. . Asked why he had shifted positions on subjects since taking over from Mr Corbyn as leader, Sir Keir said: ""When you lose that badly you don’t look to the voters and say 'what on earth do you think you were doing', you look at your party and say 'we have to change'."". One audience member told Sir Keir he feared being priced out of private schools due to Labour's plans to remove VAT tax breaks. . The Labour leader said he had nothing against private schools and recognised that parents ""work hard and save hard"" to send their children there. . However, he added that ""every parent has aspiration for their children whether they go to private school or not"".. He said money raised through his private school policy would help recruit 6,500 teachers for state secondary schools.. Asked what he feared the most about potentially becoming prime minister, the Labour leader spoke of his concern about how becoming prime minister could affect his teenage children.. He said it was ""the only thing that keeps me up at night"". . Both leaders were grilled for twenty minutes by Sky News presenter Beth Rigby, and then a further twenty minutes from the audience.. Asked about past promises from Conservative leaders that net migration would come down, Mr Sunak said he understood ""people’s cynicism” but insisted he had taken action to reduce it.. He pointed to a clampdown on abuse of social care visas and an increase of the salaries needed in order to get work visas, and said the numbers were now “heading in the right direction”.. On the economy, the prime minister said he knew things were “not easy” but that he had been taking action to make things “that little bit easier” by trying to bring down inflation.. One audience member accused Mr Sunak of moving his party “away from young people” citing the prime minister’s proposal to introduce national service.. Mr Sunak said national service would be ""transformation"" for young people, adding that he was ""incredibly excited"" for his daughters to do the scheme..

The ""modest"" wording is notable because the previous policy statement complained of a ""lack of progress"" towards lower inflation.Updating its economic projections, the Fed's median expectation for the fed funds rate at year-end 2024 is now 5.1% versus 4.6% three months ago. This means the central bank is now anticipating just one 25 basis point rate cut this year versus 75 previously. The 2025 year-end fed funds expectation is now 4.1%, suggesting 100 basis points in rate cuts next year.At his post-meeting press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said inflation remains too high and the central bank's focus remains on returning that gauge to its 2% target.Earlier today, the U.S. Consumer Price Index report for May showed an unexpected slowdown in inflation last month. The news sent crypto, stock and bond markets sharply higher as traders ratcheted upward their expectations for the commencement of Fed rate cuts.The hawkish turn in the Fed economic projections, later confirmed by Powell in his press conference, has taken the steam out of those rallies.

Redemptions came amid a BTC sell-off, during which the asset briefly tumbled to $66,200 before recovering.Grayscale’s GBTC accounted for most of the $120 million in outflows, leading among its counterparts. GBTC continues its infamous run of being the worst-performing ETF by outflows since going live in January, racking up a cumulative $18 billion in outflows.Ark Invest’s ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC and VanEck’s HODL recorded outflows ranging from $56 million to $7 million.

For ""proof-of-stake"" blockchains like Ethereum, staking is the primary way that the network is kept secure.“With Pooled Staking, MetaMask users now have an easy way to stake ETH in enterprise-gradevalidators while maintaining full control of their ETH, earning rewards and making Ethereum more secure,” Matthieu Saint Olive, senior product manager at MetaMask developer Consensys, said in a statement.Staking on Ethereum conventionally requires users to tie up 32 ETH with the network, which at current market prices totals some $112,000. ""Pooled"" services like Lido, Rocket Pool and now MetaMask give more users access to staking by bundling together assets from various people, making it possible for anyone to stake even if they don't have 32 ETH.Read more: Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking?MetaMask's staking feature may come as a welcome surprise to some retail traders who want to stake, trade and monitor their staking investment in one interface.But Consensys is playing catch-up with industry peers: MetaMask is far from the first crypto wallet to introduce staking, and it is missing some of the functionality that has helped to differentiate incumbent pooled staking platforms.Most glaringly, Lido and Rocket Pool offer users receipts on their deposits called ""liquid staking tokens"" that can be borrowed, loaned or re-invested into decentralized finance protocols. LSTs like Lido staked ETH (stETH) are among the more popular assets in crypto trading.MetaMask doesn't plan to offer its own LST as part of its pooled staking service.The new staking feature will not be available in the U.S. or UK, according to Consensys.""The team aims to bring it to market in these regions as well,"" the company said in its statement.Correction (14:21:10 UTC 6/12/24): Ethereum is a proof-of-stake blockchain.Edited by Bradley Keoun."

NEW YORK -- Eight former employees sued SpaceX and its CEO Elon Musk, alleging that Musk ordered them fired after they challenged what they called rampant sexual harassment and a hostile “Animal House”-style work environment at the company. . The employees, who filed suit in a California state court, detailed their complaints in a 2022 open letter to management they shared via a company intranet. The next day, four of the plaintiffs were fired, they alleged; others were terminated later after an internal investigation.. In January, the federal National Labor Relations Board filed its own complaint against SpaceX based on issues raised by nine fired employees.. Among other workplace concerns, the open letter called on executives to condemn Musk’s public behavior on X — the platform then known as Twitter — and to hold all employees accountable for unacceptable conduct. Musk’s actions included making light of sexual harassment allegations against him — charges that the billionaire denied.. “As our CEO and most prominent spokesperson, Elon is seen as the face of SpaceX — every tweet that Elon sends is a de facto public statement by the company,” the open letter said at the time. The letter also referred to Musk’s actions as a ”frequent source of distraction and embarrassment.”. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages.. The complaint drew connections between Musk's behavior — in particular, his often lewd posts on Twitter — and the working environment at SpaceX. It states that one of the plaintiffs, Yaman Abdulhak, noted that many of the inappropriate examples cited in a 2021 “appropriate behavior” employee training “closely resembled the contents of Musk's tweets.” Abdulhak sent examples of those tweets to the SpaceX human resources director, who took no action, the complaint stated.. SpaceX did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Hollywood's A-listers are lining up behind Joe Biden. Will their support matter in November?,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/hollywoods-listers-lining-joe-biden-support-matter-november-111081127,2024-06-13 01:18:17,"Celebrities are increasingly lending their star power to President Joe Biden, hoping to energize their fans to vote for him in November and entice donors to pony up for his campaign. WASHINGTON -- When Robert De Niro showed up outside a Manhattan courthouse to decry Donald Trump as his New York hush money trial was winding down, it sparked a life-imitates-art screaming match with a nearby group of the former president's supporters.. “You are gangsters!” De Niro, who starred in “Goodfellas” and won an Oscar for “The Godfather Part II,"" shouted at the Trump backers, who responded with obscenities.. There are plenty more Hollywood storylines still to come in the 2024 campaign: Celebrities are increasingly lending their star power to President Joe Biden, hoping to energize their fans to vote for him in November and to entice donors to pony up for his reelection effort.. On Saturday, A-listers George Clooney and Julia Roberts will team up with former President Barack Obama at a Biden fundraiser in Los Angeles, where the three will be interviewed by late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. Roberts and Kimmel have already begun soliciting donations via text for Biden, who is skipping a weekend peace conference on Ukraine being held in Switzerland to attend the event. . Director Steven Spielberg is involved in storytelling efforts for the Democratic National Convention in August. Lenny Kravitz, Barbra Streisand and James Taylor have all performed for Biden donors.. Others who've sent fundraising emails, organized events or otherwise lent their support include Connie Britton of “The White Lotus” fame, singer-songwriter Carole King, “Bridgerton” creator Shonda Rhimes, singer Christina Aguilera, “The Equalizer” actress Queen Latifah and “Star Wars” actor Mark Hamill, who turned up in the White House briefing room last month to personally praise the president.. And, in another instance blurring lines between real life and make-believe, during a fundraiser at the home of veteran actor Michael Douglas, Biden, the actual president, congratulated the star of the 1996 hit “The American President” on his fictional administration's success. . For all the celebrity supporters, though, there's little expectation they can determine votes. Rather, they are seen as having the ability to inject excitement that helps energize supporters.. Lexi Underwood, whose credits include the streaming series “Little Fires Everywhere,” calls acting a “contact sport” that allows her to interact with the public and makes her determined to use her influence responsibly. She has participated in a recent virtual ”Students for Biden” event and traveled to Nevada to appear at campaign events focused on women's health issues.. “I’m very fortunate to have certain eyes on me,"" said Underwood, 20. ""I feel really responsible to make sure that what I put out there, either people are being informed on things that they weren’t previously informed on, or that I’m motivating them to get out there and vote.”. Biden's campaign says its chief focus is finding authentic and trusted messengers who can promote the president's policy achievements and raise the alarm about GOP “extremism,"" and that means deploying everyday supporters as well as famous ones. It has produced ads featuring a Pennsylvania union worker, a Black entrepreneur in Detroit and women adversely affected by strict abortion limits in Texas.. Fai Nelson, a human resources worker who attended a recent Vice President Kamala Harris event in Prince George's County, Maryland, said celebrity voices can make a difference “if they can touch the audience.” . “It’s whether the message is relevant,"" said Nelson, 42.. During the pandemic-era campaign of 2020, Biden's campaign featured celebrities in scores of virtual events that showed the importance of staying flexible so that stars can present themselves in the most authentic ways. . Adrienne Elrod, who served as Biden’s 2020 director of surrogate strategy and operations, said famous Biden supporters often “will come forward with their own ideas” on how to help the campaign and what issues they'd like to focus on. . “We’ll oftentimes have ideas for them as well,"" she said. “That’s why there’s always a very productive working relationship when we’re engaging these folks.”. De Niro has taken on an increasingly prominent role in Biden's campaign. Before his confrontation with the Trump supporters, the actor held a press conference calling the former president a “clown."" He's also attended Biden fundraisers and narrated a campaign ad accusing Trump of having “snapped” after he lost the 2020 election. . Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the former president's campaign, said, “The only people in America who support Joe Biden’s failing campaign are elitist Hollywood celebrities,"" adding that Trump “speaks for the forgotten men and women of this country.”. Trump has his own list of celebrity endorsers, which includes musicians Kid Rock and Ted Nugent, UFC CEO Dana White, media personality Caitlyn Jenner and actors Dennis Quaid and Jon Voight, as well as comedian Roseanne Barr.. Elrod said other stars are anxious to follow De Niro's lead for Biden but are waiting ""until the moment can truly be maximized"" before they get involved. She pointed to 2020, when Bruce Springsteen narrated a Biden ad featuring his song “My Hometown” just before the election.. ""I think you’ll see more moments like this, when we’re using those voices strategically and effectively at the time that makes the most sense for us on the campaign,” said Elrod, who is a Biden campaign spokesperson this cycle.. David Schmid, an English professor at the University of Buffalo who studies popular culture, said celebrities can influence fans' aspirations and what they consume. But their influence “over peoples’ voting habits has been really exaggerated,"" he said. . That's the case for Alex Dillion, a rising sophomore at American University in Washington who also attended the Harris event in Maryland. Asked which famous person might influence him politically, Dillion offered, “Maybe Obama.”. Schmid said one celebrity with outsized political influence might be Taylor Swift, who sent shockwaves even through the NFL last season. She endorsed Biden in 2020 and is being openly courted by the campaign this time on social media, and even in a press release that saluted her latest album.. Her touch isn't a guarantee of victory, though. In 2018, Swift endorsed two Democratic candidates in Tennessee who lost. And Schmid said that even someone as famous as Swift “knows things are polarizing and they don't want to take major risks” on candidates and contentious issues.. For all the Biden team's work with celebrities, the president still tries to cultivate the image of someone in tune with ordinary people.. During a campaign swing through Saginaw, Michigan, the president visited a public golf course and met with community activist Coleman Hurley III and his son.. “The celebrities that have everything they want and they need, they may possibly be out of touch,"" the older Hurley said later in a phone interview.. As for ordinary Americans, Hurley added, Biden needs to be able to ""relate and see where they live ... and then have a conversation about some of the different struggles or issues that we, or other Americans, face.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

For more than six years, the 1200 building at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School sat untouched like a time capsule, with its classrooms still filled with dried blood and students' strewn papers.. This week, the site of the Parkland, Florida, mass shooting will be torn down -- a move two grieving moms say is long overdue.. The demolition will start Thursday, timed for immediately after the last day of school, which was on Monday, according to Broward County Public Schools.. Seventeen students and staff members were killed in the Feb. 14, 2018, massacre. Victims' families were permitted to go inside the 1200 building for the first time last summer, following the conclusion of the trials of gunman Nikolas Cruz, who was sentenced to life in prison, and former school officer Scot Peterson, who was acquitted of child neglect after he had allegedly retreated while students were being shot.. Victim Scott Beigel's mother, Linda Beigel Schulman, was adamant about going in the building -- and she said she was not prepared for what she saw.. ""It was horrible,"" she told ABC News last year. ""All the glass being shot out ... seeing the bullet holes in the walls."". Beigel, a geography teacher and cross-country coach, was shot to death while ushering his students to safety in his third floor classroom.. Inside Beigel's room, Schulman saw her son's notes and his open laptop, covered in dust.. One year later, the images are just as vivid in her mind.. ""I could draw Scott's room,"" Schulman told ABC News last week. ""I see Scott's desk, I see as you walk into Scott's room where he was when he was murdered."". As hard as it was to witness, Schulman said she's glad she did.. ""I came out very different after the trial than I went in, and it took me awhile to process [the details the trial provided]. And going back into Scott's classroom was really the same,"" Schulman explained. ""I was definitely not the same when I came out of there."". ""It's just a body-shaking experience,"" she said. ""That's where he worked and that was his happy place -- and that's where Scott was murdered."". Patricia Oliver, whose fun, athletic 17-year-old son Joaquin was among those killed, never stepped foot in the 1200 building. She said it'd be too painful.. ""Walking through the area where he was found, surrounded by blood, that I can't handle -- I really can't handle it,"" she told ABC News last week.. Seeing ""every single piece of evidence [at Cruz's trial], to me, was more than enough,"" Oliver said. ""I need my well-being in the right place."". ""I know more than enough of what happened to him -- and his absence is absolutely painful every single day,"" she added.. After the families' visits, politicians went to the 1200 building to see the bullet-ridden walls for themselves, including Vice President Kamala Harris and some members of Congress.. ""It's important to see, unfortunately, what it looks like when a mass shooting comes to your high school,"" Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., who graduated from Stoneman Douglas, said at the time. ""Every backpack that was dropped, every shoe that fell off ... is exactly as it was on that very day."". Schulman supported the tours and said witnessing the inside of that building should've been mandatory for lawmakers to help open their eyes to the realities of gun violence.. But, Oliver said, ""I wasn't comfortable seeing they were using the building as an exhibition."". ""This is not a circus,"" Oliver said. ""It is a crime scene."". ""Every parent reacts in a different way, and that doesn't mean it's good or bad,"" Oliver added. ""I think everyone is carrying this emptiness, that, you don't know how to handle it. It's not for me to judge anyone."". . Neither Oliver nor Schulman will go witness the demolition. But both mothers say it's overdue.. Oliver drives by the school frequently and she said it'll bring her relief to not have the ""physical reminder."". Schulman lives in New York, but she said on each trip to Parkland, she feels nauseous passing by the building.. ""I think it's a long time coming,"" Schulman said. ""We can never forget -- we just don't need that."". Demolition will likely take several weeks, and will involve dismantling the structure in pieces, starting with the top floor, the school district said.. ""Survivors of the tragedy, families of victims, as well as teachers and staff had any items they desired returned to them,"" according to the district.. District officials have not revealed any future plans for the site.. Schulman said she hopes it'll be transformed into a place for students to have fun and laugh, like a baseball field.. ""Something that brings joy. Because it's done nothing in the last six years but bring horror,"" Schulman said.. Oliver said she'd like the space to be filled with whatever would bring comfort and peace to current students, like a garden or patio.. . The district said in a statement last month, ""We understand this is a sensitive and difficult time for the families of those who were killed, those who were injured, and all of those who are forever impacted by the tragedy. ... We will continue to keep the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School community informed and updated as we navigate this process together."". In the wake of their tragedies, both moms are finding ways to honor their sons' lives.. Schulman and her husband started the Scott J. Beigel Memorial Fund, which sends at-risk kids touched by gun violence to camp.. ""They can actually leave their cares behind -- they can just be kids,"" she said.. Oliver and her husband have become advocates for gun control through their organization Change the Ref.. Each summer, they ramp up their efforts with events honoring Joaquin's Aug. 4 birthday. This year, he would've turned 24.. Joaquin was always looking ahead, his mom said. Now, ""he’s the one who pushes us,"" she said.. ""We need to keep going, we need to keep fighting,"" she said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

At the on-camera Pentagon press briefing, spokesperson Sabrina Singh downplayed the Russian naval flotilla's arrival in Havana noting that it's happened multiple times over the years but acknowledged that U.S. military assets had been tracking the ships on their way to Cuba.. ""We've been tracking the Russians plans for this,"" Sabrina Singh, the Pentagon's deputy press secretary told reporters Wednesday.. . The Russian ships' transit towards Cuba was monitored by six warships from the United States Navy, Canada, and France. They included the U.S. Navy destroyers USS Donald Cook, USS Delbert Black, USS Truxton, U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Stone, the Canadian frigate HMCS Ville de Quebec, and a French Lafayette class frigate.. ""This is not a surprise we've seen them do this these type of port calls before and these are routine naval visits that we've seen under different administrations,"" Singh said.. ""We're always constantly going to monitor any foreign vessels operating near U.S. territorial waters,"" she added. U.S. territorial waters stretch out 12 nautical miles from the coastline.. A U.S. official said the Russian ships never came close to the American coastline as they transited the Atlantic Ocean.. Russia's Defense Ministry has been very open about the port of call in Havana being made by the frigate ""Admiral Gorshkov,"" the nuclear-powered submarine ""Kazan,"" the sea supply tanker ""Akademik Pashin"" and the ocean rescue tug ""Nikolai Chiker."". Cuba's defense ministry has described the visit as ""keeping with the historical friendly ties between Cuba and the Russian Federation and is fully consistent with international rules."" In a statement, the ministry said ""none of the ships carry nuclear weapons, due to which our country does not pose any threat to the region."". Even though the Russian ships are in port, Singh said the U.S. was ""going to continue to monitor what's happening in the region."". According to the Pentagon, Russia has sailed warships into the Western Hemisphere yearly from 2013 to 2020 with regular port visits into Havana.. The most recent docking of a warship was in June 2023 though the most recent military exercise in the region was in 2008 with Venezuela.. A U.S. official said that the port visit to Havana will last a few days and that sometime next week the Russian flotilla is expected to make a port of call in Venezuela.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,"Jerry West, Hall of Fame Lakers player and executive, dies at 86",https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/jerry-west-hall-fame-lakers-player-executive-dies/story?id=111054219,2024-06-12 14:23:43,"West was the first NBA Finals MVP in 1969.. Hall of Fame NBA player and executive Jerry West -- who won eight NBA titles as a member of the front office for the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors -- died Wednesday, according to the Los Angeles Clippers.. West, known as ""The Logo"" due to his silhouette being used as the NBA logo, was 86 years old.. West, whose teams often came up short against Bill Russell and the Celtics in the '60s, finally won his only title as a player with the Lakers in 1972. Though his teams often came up short for the title, West won the NBA Finals MVP in 1969 -- the first award ever given -- despite losing the series.. “Jerry West, the personification of basketball excellence and a friend to all who knew him, passed away peacefully this morning at the age of 86. His wife, Karen, was by his side,” the Clippers announced in a statement.. West had been an executive with the Clippers since 2017. He made his name as an executive with the Los Angeles Lakers, though.. He served as executive during the run of the Showtime Lakers, led by Magic Johnson, during the 1980s. The team won five championships during the decade (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988).. ""Jerry’s four decades with the Lakers also included a successful stint as a head coach and a remarkable run in the front office that cemented his reputation as one of the greatest executives in sports history,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. ""He helped build eight championship teams during his tenure in the NBA – a legacy of achievement that mirrors his on-court excellence. And he will be enshrined this October into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor, becoming the first person ever inducted as both a player and a contributor.. . Born in West Virginia in 1938, he also earned the nickname ""Zeke from Cabin Creek"" for his humble upbringing. He stayed home to attend West Virginia University, and led his squad to the NCAA title game in 1959. The team came up short against California, but West won the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player anyway -- a foreshadowing of his 1969 NBA Finals MVP.. He also would lead Team USA, alongside fellow future Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson, to the gold medal in the 1960 Rome Olympics.. The 6-foot-3 combo guard was drafted No. 2 overall in the 1960 NBA draft -- behind Robertson -- by the then-Minneapolis Lakers. He was named to the All-Star Game in all 14 years he played in the league -- all for the Lakers -- and averaged 27 points, 6.7 assists and 5.8 rebounds per game over his career. He amped that up with 29.1 points per game in the playoffs over his career.. He briefly served as Lakers head coach after his retirement as a player, but really found his calling in the front office.. After building a dynasty in the '80s, he did it again in the '90s by drafting high schooler Kobe Bryant in 1996 and signing Shaquille O'Neal away from the Orlando Magic in the same season.. He also served as an executive with the Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors,. West was portrayed by actor Jason Clarke in the recent HBO series ""Winning Time,"" about the 1980s Lakers. West took issue with his portrayal as someone who routinely lost his temper and unleashed strings of profanities. West asked for a retraction from producers at the time.. ""The portrayal of NBA icon and L.A. Lakers legend Jerry West in 'Winning Time' is fiction pretending to be fact -- a deliberately false characterization that has caused great distress to Jerry and his family,"" Skip Miller, West's lawyer, said in April 2022. ""Contrary to the baseless portrayal in the HBO series, Jerry had nothing but love for and harmony with the Lakers organization, and in particular owner Dr. Jerry Buss, during an era in which he assembled one of the greatest teams in NBA history."". 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,$20 switch fueling surge in machine-gun violence: Experts,https://abcnews.go.com/US/machine-gun-conversion-device-taking-violence-level-experts/story?id=110855649,2024-06-12 16:37:12,"""These are weapons of war,"" said the dad of a teen killed in a hail of 89 shots.. Just weeks before he was killed along with three others in a hail of gunfire at a Sweet 16 birthday party in Dadeville, Alabama, 19-year-old Marsiah Collins told his father about a growing national crime trend that had reached their community: teenagers armed with weapons converted into machine guns with a cheap accessory available on the internet.. One of the seven handguns involved in the April 15, 2023, rural Alabama mass shooting that also left 32 partygoers injured at a dance studio was fitted with a tiny illegal device often dubbed a ""Glock switch"" that turns semiautomatic Glock weapons into fully automatic firearms, according to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. Investigators collected 89 shell casings at the Dadeville crime scene.. ""It was Marsiah who told me that these kids out here have handguns that are like machine guns. I never will forget that conversation. He told me out of his own mouth, kids as young as 14 or 15,"" Collins' father, Martin Collins Jr., told ABC News. ""It's the worst invention in American history, in world history."". With the official start of summer less than a week away, police across the nation are bracing for what one law enforcement expert described to ABC News as the ""next level"" of gun violence. Law enforcement officials attribute a dramatic increase in the number of shots fired at crime scenes across the country to a lethal combination: multiple people drawing guns in crowded settings to settle disputes and a growing number of criminals using Glock firearms converted to machine guns and equipped with extended magazines.. ""What that's telling us is that criminals who already are owning these handguns illegally are now taking it to the next level, and they are trying to maximize the destruction that they cause,"" Jillian Snider, a former New York City police officer and an adjunct lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told ABC News.. In the first weekend of June, police in four U.S. cities investigated shootings in which a minimum of 25 shots were fired to a barrage of more than 100 bullets. In those four shootings alone, 42 people were shot, 2 fatally, authorities said.. The shootings during the weekend of June 1-2 included one at a birthday party in Akron, Ohio, that left one man dead, 28 people wounded, and police collecting 45 shell casings from five different weapons in over a blocklong crime scene, authorities said. That weekend also included three men being shot, one fatally, in a Joliet, Illinois, drive-by shooting on a home, where police discovered 25 shell casings. And in St. Louis, Missouri, six people were shot outside the Playground Bar & Grill, where police collected more than 100 shell casings.. Detroit Police Chief James White told ABC News that when he heard detectives had recovered 93 shell casings from a June 1 shooting that left four people wounded, two critically, at a late-night party in north Detroit, his gut feeling told him a modified gun was used.. ""When you get that number of shell casings in an incident like that, it passes through your mind that obviously it was either semiautomatic or an automatic weapon involved. I was not surprised that it was a Glock switch. Unfortunately, they're becoming all too common in our community,"" White said.. White said eight guns were recovered at the crime scene, including an AK-47 rifle. Two of the weapons were found to be stolen, including the one equipped with a Glock switch, he said. No arrests have been made, but White said police are making progress in the investigation and expects those responsible to be in custody soon, adding, ""There were shots back and forth between some folks who had problems with some folks at the party."". ""We're seeing a lot of Glock switches, we're seeing a resurgence of the AR handgun and rifle,"" White said. ""They're falling into the wrong hands. They are falling into the hands of teenagers and young adults. Folks are making just horrible decisions, impulsive decisions with the inability to resolve relatively basic conflict."". White said there is no other reason to have guns with fully automatic conversion devices, other than to “cause mass destruction quickly amongst large groups of people."". ""If no one cares about that, I think we've got a bigger problem than the Glock switch itself. Everyone should care about this, every single human being should care about this,"" said White.. During a news conference last week, St. Louis Police Chief Robert Tracy noted that of the six people shot in the gunfight outside the Playground Bar & Grill, two were convicted felons and two were undocumented gang members.. ""Knowing people with the highest propensity for violence, carrying guns, known to each other is sometimes a recipe for disaster,"" Tracy said. ""Too many guns are in the hands of people that are going to use them in incidents like this."". According to a 2023 report by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, 5,454 guns with machine-gun conversion devices were taken into ATF custody at crime scenes between 2017 and 2021, a 570% increase in the five-year period. Between 2012 and 2016, the ATF seized 814 guns equipped with such devices, according to the report.. “From a public safety perspective, from a public health perspective, this is a problem that, unfortunately, is disproportionately concentrated in the country's most economically vulnerable communities of color,"" Jens Ludwig, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, told ABC News.. Law enforcement officials said the machine-gun conversion devices -- also called ""auto sear"" -- are believed to be mostly manufactured overseas and sold on the internet. They can even be made with 3D printers and cost as little as $20 to buy, officials said.. ""Let me be clear: Making, selling and just having these kinds of machine gun conversion devices is against the law,"" ATF Director Steven Dettelbach said during a February 2023 gun violence prevention forum held in New York City. ""This is a problem that needs to be focused on immediately. These devices are flooding our communities."". An alarming number of high-profile shootings involving multiple shooters or converted fully-automatic weapons have erupted in the first five months of 2024 in American cities both big and small.. On March 6, eight teenagers, ages 15 to 17, were shot at a Philadelphia SEPTA bus stop by three masked gunmen who opened fire, spaying more than 30 shots in a matter of seconds, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. One of the guns seized in the crime was a Glock 22 pistol with a Glock switch and laser sights. Five suspects, ranging in age from 15 to 19, were arrested and charged in the shooting, according to police.. On April 1, four people were injured in a shooting at a block party at a public housing development in Paris, Texas, when a dispute between two men escalated into a gunfight that involved multiple firearms. Paris police reported that at least 80 shell casings were collected at the scene, but have not said if any of the weapons were modified machine guns. A 42-year-old man was arrested in the shooting and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon in a weapon-free zone, according to police.. On April 11, 2024, a 14-year-old boy was arrested in Columbia, South Carolina, and charged with murder in the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old boy and his father during a robbery, according to the Columbia Police Department. Police said the young suspect, who shot himself in the leg during the incident, was armed with a pistol illegally modified with a switch.. On April 20, two people were killed and seven were injured at a block party in Memphis, Tennessee, when multiple people pulled out guns, including at least one fitted with a switch, and opened fire, according to the Memphis Police Department.. ""I think that the thing that is deeply unhelpful from a public safety perspective is the simultaneous development of these Glock switches that turn semiautomatics into basically machine guns together with the lapse of the high-capacity magazine ban,"" said Ludwig, referring to the law banning magazines holding more than 10 bullets which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and expired in September.. ""So now you've got a 16-year-old kid with basically a machine gun that can fire 100 rounds with the trigger depressed like that, just driving around the South Side of Chicago. You can see how that’s a terrible recipe for disaster,"" Ludwig said.. Glock switches, also referred to by law enforcement as ""auto sears,"" are devices about the size of a quarter that can be easily fitted onto the back of a handgun's slide mechanism. Once attached, the metal or plastic part manipulates the gun's trigger bar, turning the weapon from a semiautomatic, which requires a pull of the trigger for each shot fired, into a fully automatic weapon in which numerous shots can be fired by depressing the trigger and holding it, experts said.. A first-of-its-kind lawsuit filed in March by the city of Chicago against Glock Inc. is attempting to force the gun manufacturer to retool its weapons to make it more difficult to convert them into machine guns with a switch. The suit alleges Glock is aiding and abetting in the proliferation of illegal machine guns.. Georgia-based Glock Inc. does not make the switches and has no affiliation with those who manufacture them. The company did not respond to requests from ABC News for comment.. According to the lawsuit, the Chicago Police Department said that between the beginning of 2021 and Dec. 31, 2023, officers recovered more than 1,000 Glock guns that had been modified into automatic weapons.. ""These terrifying weapons have caused death and destruction throughout Chicago: they have been recovered in connection with homicides, aggravated assaults, batteries, kidnappings, burglaries, home invasions, carjackings, and attempted robberies,"" according to the lawsuit.. The lawsuit alleges that Glock Inc. has known about the dangerous work-around for years, but has made the ""wilful decision to not take any meaningful action to address this problem."". ""Indeed, in stark contrast to Glock pistols, the process of modifying most other popular pistols into machine guns, such as those produced by Smith & Wesson or Sig Sauer, require time-consuming and difficult engineering well beyond the capability of most civilians,"" the lawsuit alleges.. Ludwig said the surge in the number of modified guns on Chicago streets coincides with an increase in the fatality rate per shooting in the city. He said a study done by the University of Chicago Crime Lab found that fatalities in shooting incidents in Chicago have risen from 13% in 2010 to 19% in 2023.. ""Unfortunately, we have thousands and thousands of people shot in Chicago every year. So an increase of something like a third or more in the shooting fatality rate winds up generating a huge increase in the number of murders even if you hold the number of shootings constant,"" Ludwig said. ""Just that increase in the shooting fatality rate means that we have 1/3 more murders in Chicago today than we would if shootings were as lethal as they were back in 2010. So it's a really, really big deal."". Snider, who is also director of criminal justice and civil liberties at the R Street Institute, a public policy think tank in Washington D.C., said the ages of people caught with modified guns ""is petrifying."". ""What happens is because they're untrained and unskilled, and these are dangerous weapons, oftentimes, an innocent person who has nothing to do with the situation gets caught in the crossfire,"" Snider told ABC News, adding that the rapid recoil on such modified weapons makes them almost uncontrollable for adults and teenagers with no training.. Snider said the converted weapons are also being used on law enforcement officers more frequently.. On April 12, 2024, in Memphis, Tennessee, police officer Joseph McKinney was killed and two other officers were wounded in a firefight that erupted as they responded to a suspicious vehicle call. They were confronted by two teenagers in the car, one firing a handgun modified with a Glock switch, according to the Memphis Police Department. An 18-year-old suspect was killed and a 17-year-old accomplice was wounded, police said.. In September 2021, Houston Police Officer William Jeffery was killed and another officer was seriously wounded while serving a narcotics arrest warrant on a suspect who opened fire on them with a weapon that had been turned into a machine gun, according to the Houston Police Department. The officers exchanged gunshots with the suspect, killing him, officials said. . In November 2023, a 20-year-old murder suspect with a modified handgun allegedly opened fire on Dallas police officers and U.S. Marshals attempting to arrest him, according to the Dallas Police Department. One officer was shot in the leg during the gunfight, police said.. ""Most officers’ guns carry either 11 or 16 rounds. That's most officers. And we're seeing more and more that ... people are able to get off 50 to 100 shots in under a minute [with these modified weapons],"" said Snider, who retired from the NYPD in 2020.. Many states and cities seeing large increases in the number of gun conversion devices seized by police, are taking action.. On Monday, federal prosecutors in Texas announced the launch of ""Operation Texas Kill Switch,"" a statewide initiative targeting illegal machine gun conversion devices. Officials said that between 2017 and 2023, Texas-based ATF agents seized 991 Glock switches; 490 in just the last year, officials said.. ""Today is an important step to put on notice those who traffic in switches and who use switches. We will hold you to account,"" said Alamdar Hamdani, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Texas.. . Hamandi said his office was teaming up with the ATF and Crime Stoppers to offer cash rewards for information leading to the arrests and prosecution of suspects who possess gun conversion devices or 3D printers used to manufacture them. Hamandi said anyone caught with such devices could face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.. New York lawmakers proposed legislation in May that would prohibit the sale of semiautomatic pistols that can easily be turned into automatic weapons and require firearm manufacturers to take steps to ensure their handguns cannot be easily turned into machine guns with switches.. . The Alabama House of Representatives passed a bill in May to ban the possession of any part or combination of parts designed to convert a firearm into a machine gun. The bill, now being considered by the state Senate, would also make possession of such devices a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in state prison.. Martin Collins Jr. said that while he is encouraged to see states and cities taking action to stop the spread of converted guns like the one used to kill his son, an honor student and athlete who was planning to attend Louisiana State University, he remains skeptical that real change will occur.. ""We have had numerous attempts to ban switches in this country, but it always ends up in political discourse,"" said Collins, a lawyer. ""While they're inactive, we continue to bury America's children of all races and colors,"" Collins said.. A Marine who served in Iraq, Collins said he never thought his son would be killed in a small American town like Dadeville, Alabama, by someone using a ""weapon of war."". ""It’s profoundly out of control. In the Marine Corps for an M16A4 service rifle, you have a 30-round magazine. You don't even load 30 rounds because the magazine jams. So you put 27 in and the last three you pray, but that’s also to control the rate of fire,"" Collins said. ""If the military is concerned about the number of rounds being expended, then we as a country should also be concerned about that."". In the year since his son was killed, Collins said he has spoken with local, state and federal officials, telling them converted guns are not just killing victims, but devastating entire families.. ""I tell every congressman, congresswoman, senator, state representative, local representative until you walk into a funeral home and see your 19-year-old son wrapped in plastic from the morgue and knowing what they did to him, you will never understand,"" Collins said. ""But I live with that every day because I went to see what they did to my son."". 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

The State Department has launched a beta program for passport renewal applications that will be open to the public, according to senior officials at the department.. According to the officials, the program will begin by accepting a small number of online applications each day, with that limited number gradually ramping up as time goes on to ensure the State Department ""can track any issues that arise and address them quickly and continuously improve the experience for the American people."". ""The goal of online passport renewal is to save Americans time and effort, making it more convenient to renew their U.S. passports,"" one senior State Department official said.. . Eligible applicants must be 25 or older, live in the United states or one of its territories, currently hold a passport that is or was valid for a 10-year period, was issued between 2009 and 2015, and the biographic data on the document must be accurate and not require any changes to name, gender, date or place of birth.. Applicants should also not have scheduled international travel for at least eight weeks from the point they submit the application and must be requesting routine -- not expedited -- service.. The officials also noted that once the online application for renewal is submitted, the old passport will be cancelled, and they will be unable to use it to travel internationally.. Officials didn't specify how long this beta program is expected to run, saying only that it will ""continue over the course of the coming months."". Initially, officials say processing times will be the same as wait times for regular, mail-in renewals, but they anticipate the overall wait will ""eventually"" be shorter because applicants won't have to mail in their documents.. The State Department has previously conducted several rounds of testing for the digital system, processing 565,000 online applications to date.. . The creation of an online passport renewal process was first announced in 2021 by President Joe Biden. The White House originally anticipated rolling out a finished product much earlier, by the end of 2022.. One senior State Department official explained that the delay was because the administration wanted to ensure the experience of applying for a new passport online was the best it could be, but the department was also bogged down through 2022 and much of 2023 by a backlog of passport applications created by pandemic restrictions.. As for regular passport processing times, the officials say they are still seeing a ""strong demand"" from the public, but that they should have ""no trouble"" meeting it and ""no significant delays in processing"" throughout the year.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Oklahoma girl becomes 1st child to undergo robotic deep brain stimulation,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/oklahoma-girl-1st-pediatric-patient-undergo-robotic-deep/story?id=111050121,2024-06-12 15:52:56,"Karleigh Fry, 8, underwent the procedure to help treat a neurological disorder.. An Oklahoma girl has become the first pediatric patient in the world to have robotic deep brain stimulation performed on her, two hospitals have announced.. The patient, 8-year-old Karliegh Fry, suffers from rapid-onset primary dystonia, a neurological movement disorder that causes involuntary muscle contractions.. Karleigh's condition initially left her paralyzed, unable to walk, eat or sit up on her own. She was put on several medications, which improved her condition slightly, but she was also left at times with involuntary movements that caused her to injure herself.. . A joint team at Oklahoma Children's Hospital OU Health and Bethany Children's Health Center began exploring options and decided she might be a good candidate for deep brain stimulation (DBS).. ""This marked the global debut of using a robot from our operating rooms to perform DBS in a child, setting a precedent not only in Oklahoma but also across the United States and worldwide,"" Dr. Andrew Jea, a pediatric neurosurgeon at Oklahoma Children's Hospital, said in a press release.. Deep brain stimulation is a procedure in which a surgeon implants one or more small wires knows as electrodes, or leads, in the brain. The electrodes are connected to a small device called a neurostimulator implanted in the upper chest.. It is used in the treatment of neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and Tourette's syndrome. These conditions are caused by disorganized electrical signals in the parts of the brain that control movement, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.. DBS works by interrupting the irregular signals that causes tremors or other involuntary movements. It does not cure these conditions but can improve a patient's quality of life.. Using a robot to perform the procedure enhances ""surgical precision and safety,"" according to OU Health.. . ""So it was like trying to decide if we thought that the surgery would be worth the risk ... but I think anything to give her her best shot,"" Karleigh's mother, Trisha Fry, said in an interview with OU Health.. Karleigh's surgery was split into two separate parts, according to her mother. The surgery was performed at Oklahoma Children's Hospital and Karleigh was transferred to Bethany Children's Health Center for post-operative care and pediatric rehabilitation.. Within a few minutes of the neurostimulator being activated, OU Health said Karleigh was able to lower and relax her arms, which she couldn't do prior to the procedure.. She is able to exhibit more control over her movements and her speech is also improving, the hospital said.. ""Her arms used to lock up to the point we would put socks on her hands because she would scratch her neck,"" Trisha Fry said. ""There's definitely been some improvements, even from the moment they turned it on. She is even using her voice a little bit more, and we can make out some of her words. I think she's going to have a great future for sure."". The team said Karleigh is continuing to show progress and that this could pave the way for more robotic DBS procedures performed on pediatric patients.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,98-year-old man whose liver was donated is believed to be oldest American organ donor,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/98-year-mans-liver-donated-believed-oldest-american-111061121,2024-06-12 15:50:15,"Transplant organizations say a 98-year-old man may be the oldest American to ever donate an organ. ST. LOUIS -- Orville Allen lived a lifetime of service, and when he died at age 98 he had one last thing to give: his liver.. Allen, a veteran of both World War II and the Korean War and a longtime educator in rural southeastern Missouri, is the oldest American to ever donate an organ, transplant organizations said. He died on May 29 and his liver was successfully transplanted to a 72-year-old woman, according to Mid-America Transplant.. Allen was in robust health until he suffered a fall while picking up storm debris at his home in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, on May 27, his daughter, Linda Mitchelle said. He struck the back of his head and was flown to St. Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau.. Swelling around Allen's brain couldn't be healed. As the family was preparing to say goodbye, hospital staff had a question: Would they consider donating his liver?. Given Allen's age, it was a question that caught the relatives by surprise. But surgeons had examined him and determined the organ was acceptable for transplant.. Knowing their dad's nature — always the first to check in on people, always at the doorstep of a needy neighbor — the siblings didn't hesitate.. “It turned it from being such a sad loss of our dad to having this little ray of joy because he was doing what he'd done all his life,” Mitchelle said. “He was giving one more gift.”. Previously, Cecil Lockhart of West Virginia was the oldest person to donate an organ upon death, according to the Center for Organ Recovery & Education, which coordinated recovery of his liver. He was 95 when he died in 2021, and his liver was successfully transplanted to a woman.. More people than ever are getting new organs, according to data from the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, a nonprofit organization that has run the transplant system under a government contract for nearly four decades. Last year was a record year for donations from the deceased — more than 16,000 — and for the number of organ transplants performed — more than 46,000 — according to UNOS. Liver transplants topped 10,000 for the first time ever.. Still, more than 100,000 people are on the nation’s list for a new organ and many will die waiting. The need is so great that scientists are working on alternatives to ease the ongoing shortages. Earlier this year in Massachusetts, Richard “Rick” Slayman became the first recipient of a genetically modified pig kidney. He died two months after the transplant.. Increasingly, older adults can donate organs upon their death, said Kevin Lee, president and CEO of Mid-America Transplant.. “As we’ve seen advances in medical science, we have been educating over the past five years nurses and hospital staff not to think about age when they call in those referrals, but really allow our medical team and transplant physicians to evaluate the medical eligibility of each individual,” Lee said.. Two years ago, a liver was procured from a 90-year-old donor in Mid-America's region, which includes eastern Missouri, southern Illinois and northeastern Arkansas, Lee said. Last fall, livers were donated by an 88-year-old and an 84-year-old.. The liver “is resilient. We see liver donations at all ages,” Lee said.. About 12% of deceased organ donors in the first four months of this year were people age 65 or older, UNOS spokeswoman Anne Paschke said.. “Organ donation at advanced ages can be successful and provide life-saving benefits for the recipients,” Dr. David Klassen, chief medical officer for UNOS, said in a statement. But the impact of aging varies by organ, he said. In fact, many transplant centers won’t consider hearts from senior donors.. Allen was a lifelong resident of southeast Missouri. He was a pilot in the Army Air Corps in World War II, then served in artillery communications in the Army 1st Cavalry Division in the Korean War. After the wars, he spent 27 years in the Army Reserve, retiring as a lieutenant colonel.. He also farmed and taught vocational agriculture at Neelyville High School, near Poplar Bluff, for nearly four decades. He and his wife of 70 years, Geraldine, who died in 2019, had three children, three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.. He never got around to signing up to be an organ donor, but the family said they hope his story spurs more people to register.. In fact, they said, it already has.. “A whole bunch of people at the visitation and funeral who were former students and friends said, ‘You know what? I’m going to put donor on my driver’s license right now,’” Mitchelle said.. Greg Allen, one of Orville's sons, said the ability to donate their dad's organ was uplifting in an otherwise sad time.. “To me, it's just a wonderful thing to be able to help somebody else, anybody else, to extend their life for their family,” Greg Allen said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

House Republicans on Wednesday afternoon passed a resolution to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio of President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur on his handling of classified documents.. The final vote was 216 to 207. Rep. David Joyce of Ohio was the only Republican who voted against the contempt resolution.. Speaker Mike Johnson called the outcome ""a significant step in maintaining the integrity of our oversight processes and responsibilities."". ""It is up to Congress – not the Executive Branch – to determine what materials it needs to conduct its own investigations, and there are consequences for refusing to comply with lawful Congressional subpoenas,"" Johnson said in a statement.. . Garland, in response, said it was ""deeply disappointing that this House of Representatives has turned a serious congressional authority into a partisan weapon."". ""Today's vote disregards the constitutional separation of powers, the Justice Department's need to protect its investigations, and the substantial amount of information we have provided to the Committees,"" Garland said in a statement. ""I will always stand up for this Department, its employees, and its vital mission to defend our democracy."". While the Department of Justice has made a transcript of Hur's interview with Biden available to the GOP-led committees, House Republicans argue the audio tapes are necessary to their stalled impeachment investigation into the president.. ""The Committees need the audio tapes to verify the accuracy of the written transcripts given this White House has been known to heavily edit the President's statements,"" Johnson said. ""This is a simple matter -- we have the transcript, and we need the audio."". The contempt resolution directs the House speaker to refer the case to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for possible criminal prosecution.. Before the House Judiciary Committee last week, Garland continued to defend his decision to not turn over audio tapes of the interview, over which President Biden assert executive privilege.. ""I will not be intimidated. And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy,"" Garland said at the hearing.. . Democrats have also come to Garland's defense, describing the GOP push to hold him in contempt a politically-motivated endeavor.. ""This isn't really about a policy disagreement with the DOJ, this is about feeding the MAGA base after 18 months of investigations that have produced failure after failure,"" Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said in testimony Tuesday before the House Rules Committee.. Joyce, the sole Republican to vote against the resolution, also suggested it was a partisan act.. ""As a former prosecutor, I cannot in good conscience support a resolution that would further politicize our judicial system to score political points,"" Joyce said. ""The American people expect Congress to work for them, solve policy problems, and prioritize good governance. Enough is enough.”. . In the past, Congress has held Cabinet officials in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a House subpoena, including Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in 2019 and then-Attorney General Eric Holder in 2012.. Congress held Peter Navarro, a former top trade adviser in the Trump administration, in contempt of Congress in 2022 for defying records and testimony to the now defunct House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.. Navarro was recently sentenced to four months behind bars.. Steve Bannon, a Trump ally who was also held in contempt of Congress in 2022 for not complying with the Jan. 6 select committee, has been ordered to report to jail on July 1.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

TOKYO -- Asian shares mostly rose Thursday, as investors turned their attention to what the Bank of Japan might decide on monetary policy later this week. . The Bank of Japan is not expected to raise its benchmark rate when it wraps up its meeting on Friday, but the economy is under pressure from the dollar's prolonged surge against the Japanese yen. . “Given the recent ‘hawkish hold’ outcome from the Fed, if the BOJ were to stick to its usual accommodative tone in terms of policy settings, that may pave the way for the upward trend in the U.S. dollar to the Japanese yen to continue,” Yeap Jun Rong, a market analyst at IG, said in a commentary.. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged down to 157.14 Japanese yen from 156.71 yen. The euro cost $1.0805, down from $1.0812. . As expected, the Federal Reserve kept its main interest rate steady on Wednesday following its latest policy meeting. And Treasury yields dropped after a report on inflation showed U.S. consumers paid prices that were 3.3% higher for food, insurance and everything else last month from a year earlier. Economists had been expecting to see the inflation rate stuck at 3.4%.. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 0.2% in afternoon trading to 38,807.36. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 surged 0.4% to 7,749.30.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the market with a dip of 0.1% to 38,712.21.. Smaller companies that need to borrow to grow and can therefore feel the pinch of higher interest rates more than larger rivals led the market. The smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index jumped 1.6%.. For Wall Street, a slowdown in inflation not only helps U.S. households struggling to keep up  with fast-rising prices, it also opens the door for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate. Such a move would ease pressure on the economy and give a boost to investment prices.. Everything from bitcoin to gold to copper rallied after the inflation data raised expectations for coming cuts to interest rates. A measure of nervousness among investors in U.S. stocks also eased.. Policymakers welcomed the latest update on inflation, but “we’ll need to see more good data to bolster our confidence,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. He repeated the Fed’s mantra that it needs an accumulation of data showing inflation is sustainably heading toward its 2% target before it lowers the federal funds rate, which is at the highest level in more than two decades.. “We’ll have to see where the data lights the way,” he said, reiterating the Fed’s commitment to moving based on where incoming reports steer it. . Lower interest rates could mean easier mortgage rates, helping to inject energy into the housing market. Homebuilder D.R. Horton climbed 3%.

abcnews.com,"Senate confirms new energy regulators, extending Biden's grip on panel that backs renewable energy",https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/senate-confirms-new-energy-regulators-extending-bidens-grip-111081488,2024-06-13 01:18:25,"President Joe Biden’s grip on a key federal energy commission will last beyond his first term, giving a boost to the Democrat’s push for renewable energy regardless of the election results in November. WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden's grip on a key federal energy commission will last beyond his first term, giving a boost to the Democrat's push for renewable energy regardless of the election results in November.. The Senate moved to ensure that political reality as lawmakers approved two new members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and set up a vote on a third new panelist as soon as Thursday.. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said confirmation of the three nominees would allow FERC to ""keep its quorum and continue its mission of providing Americans with affordable, reliable, safe energy.''. The five-member commission oversees natural gas pipelines and other energy infrastructure, including transmission of electricity across state lines. The panel approved a long-awaited rule last month making it easier to transmit renewable energy such as wind and solar power to the electric grid — a key part of Biden’s goal to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 2050. The rule is aimed at boosting the nation’s aging power grid to meet surging demand fueled by huge data centers, electrification of vehicles and buildings, artificial intelligence and other uses.. Earlier this week, the agency approved a request by the nearly $8 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline to begin sending natural gas across rugged mountainsides in West Virginia and Virginia, despite longstanding objections from environmental groups, landowners and some elected officials. . On Wednesday, the Senate approved the nominations of Democrat David Rosner and Republican Lindsay See for three and four-year terms, respectively, on the commission. Senators also limited debate on Democrat Judy Chang’s nomination to a five-year term. A final vote on Chang’s nomination to replace Democrat Allison Clements could occur as soon as Thursday.. If approved as expected, the vote would give Democrats a working majority on the commission until at least June 2026, when the term of Democratic Chairman Willie Phillips is set to expire.. “A fully seated, bipartisan FERC provides more opportunity for advancing long-lasting, sensible energy infrastructure policy,'' said West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat-turned-independent who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.. “When it comes to fairly assessing all interests, five heads are better than one,'' Manchin said Wednesday. “Bringing together five different people, with five different life experiences and perspectives, helps ensure that all affected interests will be heard and fairly considered and assessed'' by the energy commission.. Rosner, See and Chang “are very different people, from very different backgrounds,'' said Manchin, who supported all three nominees. ""What matters most is their willingness to work with one another, to consider and assess fairly different interests and points of view, and to put partisan passions aside in favor of the public interest.''. Rosner, a former FERC staffer, has spent the past two years on Manchin's Democratic staff on the energy committee. See, who serves as solicitor general for the state of West Virginia, argued the state's case challenging a major U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule on power plant pollution before the Supreme Court. Chang, of Massachusetts, is a former undersecretary of energy and climate solutions for the state government.. Manchin said he knows Rosner well: ""I have seen firsthand his expert knowledge on energy issues, his fairness, his nonpartisan approach to every problem we’ve had, and his ability to work with both sides on these issues, and he’s done that tremendously.''. Manchin, a political moderate who plays a crucial role on energy issues, called See “a very capable and experienced lawyer” who is ""well-qualified to serve on the commission.''. Chang, who now teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School, led energy policy under Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. “I can think of no better preparation for serving on a bipartisan commission than working for a Republican administration in a very blue state,'' Manchin said.. Rosner's nomination was approved, 67-27, while See won approval, 83-12.. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia opposed both nominations, saying he continued to be unhappy about federal approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a longtime Manchin priority.. “I voted no on rubber-stamping the same old people to FERC,” Kaine said in a statement.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

A tropical disturbance has brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida as residents prepared to weather more heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday.. Wednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.. The disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.. The disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it emerges into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.. “Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula during the next few days,” the hurricane center posted on its website Wednesday.. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable for vehicles. On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said. . The Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.. “Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,” the service said on the X social media platform. “Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.” . Mayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties — Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.. In nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.. As he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.. “I’d walk out of my car,"" he told the Herald, but his dog “has a problem with water.” . In Miami’s Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.. “This is horrible. I can’t pull my car around,” he said of the flooded streets.. Dozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL’s Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.. Farther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning. . The winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.. It's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).. Bryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.. “We are in trouble,” McNoldy wrote.. More rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.. The western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.. Forecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.. ___.

abcnews.com,Republican candidates for Utah's open US House seat split on aid for Ukraine,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/republican-candidates-utahs-open-us-house-seat-split-111081123,2024-06-13 01:10:17,"The five Republicans battling for Utah’s only open U.S. House seat have agreed in a debate that they see an urgent need to reduce federal spending. SALT LAKE CITY -- All five Republicans battling for Utah's only open U.S. House seat agreed in a debate Wednesday that they see an urgent need to reduce federal spending, but only some said cutting military aid to Ukraine would be an effective way to achieve that goal.. The crowded pool of candidates is vying to represent Utah's sweeping 3rd District, which spans the entire eastern border of the state and groups vastly different communities, from the winter resort town of Park City, to the urban center of Provo, down to the red rock recreation hub of Moab. . At the April GOP convention, state Sen. Mike Kennedy earned the official party nod for the seat U.S. Rep. John Curtis is vacating to run for U.S. Senate. But in a district that represents such a wide range of viewpoints and walks of life, Kennedy's endorsement from delegates, who tend to lean farther right than Republican voters, may not be enough to carry him through the June 25 primary. . He was joined on the debate stage Wednesday by four candidates who had already guaranteed their spots on the primary ballot before the convention by gathering signatures. . The winner of the Republican primary will face Democratic nominee Glenn Wright, a former Summit County councilmember, in November. The GOP candidate is strongly favored to win in a district that has not been represented by a Democrat since 1997.. Among the Republican contenders is Stewart Peay, an attorney and former U.S. Army captain from Alpine who is endorsed by his wife's uncle, retiring U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney. While Peay said previously that Romney's endorsement was a game changer for his campaign, he presented himself Wednesday as more conservative-leaning than his famously moderate family member. . State Auditor John Dougall similarly leaned in to conservative talking points despite having built a social media strategy around his criticism of certain Republican-backed legislation.. A series of skits shows Dougall reading a newspaper on the toilet and emerging from a bathroom stall to air his frustrations about being the state official tasked with enforcing a ban on transgender people using public restrooms or changing rooms inconsistent with their birth sex. He calls the state Legislature an “invasive and overly aggressive” body that he says too often fails to seek input from those most affected by policy.. Dougall's “bathroom monitor” character has boosted his name recognition significantly and has caught the attention of many moderate voters eager to back someone willing to challenge GOP hardliners. But Dougall refrained from taking any jabs at his party during the debate, instead touting his anti-abortion views and years of auditing experience that he said will help him reduce federal spending. . Cutting military aid to Ukraine as it continues to fend off a Russian invasion is not the way to do that, he said. . Peay agreed and urged Congress to keep sending weapons and ammunition to help the Ukrainian military. He and Case Lawrence, founder of a nationwide empire of indoor trampoline parks, stressed that withdrawing U.S. support would demonstrate weakness on the world stage. . “I don't believe in foreign aid. I believe in foreign investment, investment in American interests,” Lawrence said. “Future aid to Ukraine will be based on facts on the ground and how those affect American interests.”. Kennedy and JR Bird, mayor of the northeast Utah town of Roosevelt, said that while it pains them to see Ukraine devastated by war, it is not in the best interest of U.S. officials to continue funding their fight. . Republicans in Congress have been similarly split on whether to keep sending urgently needed weaponry to Ukraine. The Ukrainian military endured major setbacks during a monthslong funding impasse on Capitol Hill and has since burned through foreign aid faster than expected.. Bird, who promoted himself as the only candidate from a rural part of the district, said the U.S. needs to shift focus from military funding to hitting Russia with stronger sanctions. He criticized President Joe Biden's administration for what he sees as throwing money at the problem when there are more strategic ways for the U.S. to assert its influence. . Kennedy agreed, adding that he would urge the U.S. to seize Russian assets and “make them pay for the mess that they've created for us.”. “We cannot be the police officer of the whole world,” Kennedy said. “We don't have the money to do all this. Our grandchildren don't deserve us to rack up more national debt to support international wars that are not directly in our national security interest.”. Wednesday concluded a marathon week of Republican primary debates in Utah. Challengers for two of Utah’s four congressional seats faced off Monday, followed by the four Republicans battling for Romney's open U.S. Senate seat. Candidates for governor and the open attorney general position debated Tuesday.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Hollywood's A-listers are lining up behind Joe Biden. Will their support matter in November?,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/hollywoods-listers-lining-joe-biden-support-matter-november-111081125,2024-06-13 01:18:14,"Celebrities are increasingly lending their star power to President Joe Biden, hoping to energize their fans to vote for him in November and entice donors to pony up for his campaign. WASHINGTON -- When Robert De Niro showed up outside a Manhattan courthouse to decry Donald Trump as his New York hush money trial was winding down, it sparked a life-imitates-art screaming match with a nearby group of the former president's supporters.. “You are gangsters!” De Niro, who starred in “Goodfellas” and won an Oscar for “The Godfather Part II,"" shouted at the Trump backers, who responded with obscenities.. There are plenty more Hollywood storylines still to come in the 2024 campaign: Celebrities are increasingly lending their star power to President Joe Biden, hoping to energize their fans to vote for him in November and to entice donors to pony up for his reelection effort.. On Saturday, A-listers George Clooney and Julia Roberts will team up with former President Barack Obama at a Biden fundraiser in Los Angeles, where the three will be interviewed by late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. Roberts and Kimmel have already begun soliciting donations via text for Biden, who is skipping a weekend peace conference on Ukraine being held in Switzerland to attend the event. . Director Steven Spielberg is involved in storytelling efforts for the Democratic National Convention in August. Lenny Kravitz, Barbra Streisand and James Taylor have all performed for Biden donors.. Others who've sent fundraising emails, organized events or otherwise lent their support include Connie Britton of “The White Lotus” fame, singer-songwriter Carole King, “Bridgerton” creator Shonda Rhimes, singer Christina Aguilera, “The Equalizer” actress Queen Latifah and “Star Wars” actor Mark Hamill, who turned up in the White House briefing room last month to personally praise the president.. And, in another instance blurring lines between real life and make-believe, during a fundraiser at the home of veteran actor Michael Douglas, Biden, the actual president, congratulated the star of the 1996 hit “The American President” on his fictional administration's success. . For all the celebrity supporters, though, there's little expectation they can determine votes. Rather, they are seen as having the ability to inject excitement that helps energize supporters.. Lexi Underwood, whose credits include the streaming series “Little Fires Everywhere,” calls acting a “contact sport” that allows her to interact with the public and makes her determined to use her influence responsibly. She has participated in a recent virtual ”Students for Biden” event and traveled to Nevada to appear at campaign events focused on women's health issues.. “I’m very fortunate to have certain eyes on me,"" said Underwood, 20. ""I feel really responsible to make sure that what I put out there, either people are being informed on things that they weren’t previously informed on, or that I’m motivating them to get out there and vote.”. Biden's campaign says its chief focus is finding authentic and trusted messengers who can promote the president's policy achievements and raise the alarm about GOP “extremism,"" and that means deploying everyday supporters as well as famous ones. It has produced ads featuring a Pennsylvania union worker, a Black entrepreneur in Detroit and women adversely affected by strict abortion limits in Texas.. Fai Nelson, a human resources worker who attended a recent Vice President Kamala Harris event in Prince George's County, Maryland, said celebrity voices can make a difference “if they can touch the audience.” . “It’s whether the message is relevant,"" said Nelson, 42.. During the pandemic-era campaign of 2020, Biden's campaign featured celebrities in scores of virtual events that showed the importance of staying flexible so that stars can present themselves in the most authentic ways. . Adrienne Elrod, who served as Biden’s 2020 director of surrogate strategy and operations, said famous Biden supporters often “will come forward with their own ideas” on how to help the campaign and what issues they'd like to focus on. . “We’ll oftentimes have ideas for them as well,"" she said. “That’s why there’s always a very productive working relationship when we’re engaging these folks.”. De Niro has taken on an increasingly prominent role in Biden's campaign. Before his confrontation with the Trump supporters, the actor held a press conference calling the former president a “clown."" He's also attended Biden fundraisers and narrated a campaign ad accusing Trump of having “snapped” after he lost the 2020 election. . Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the former president's campaign, said, “The only people in America who support Joe Biden’s failing campaign are elitist Hollywood celebrities,"" adding that Trump “speaks for the forgotten men and women of this country.”. Trump has his own list of celebrity endorsers, which includes musicians Kid Rock and Ted Nugent, UFC CEO Dana White, media personality Caitlyn Jenner and actors Dennis Quaid and Jon Voight, as well as comedian Roseanne Barr.. Elrod said other stars are anxious to follow De Niro's lead for Biden but are waiting ""until the moment can truly be maximized"" before they get involved. She pointed to 2020, when Bruce Springsteen narrated a Biden ad featuring his song “My Hometown” just before the election.. ""I think you’ll see more moments like this, when we’re using those voices strategically and effectively at the time that makes the most sense for us on the campaign,” said Elrod, who is a Biden campaign spokesperson this cycle.. David Schmid, an English professor at the University of Buffalo who studies popular culture, said celebrities can influence fans' aspirations and what they consume. But their influence “over peoples’ voting habits has been really exaggerated,"" he said. . That's the case for Alex Dillion, a rising sophomore at American University in Washington who also attended the Harris event in Maryland. Asked which famous person might influence him politically, Dillion offered, “Maybe Obama.”. Schmid said one celebrity with outsized political influence might be Taylor Swift, who sent shockwaves even through the NFL last season. She endorsed Biden in 2020 and is being openly courted by the campaign this time on social media, and even in a press release that saluted her latest album.. Her touch isn't a guarantee of victory, though. In 2018, Swift endorsed two Democratic candidates in Tennessee who lost. And Schmid said that even someone as famous as Swift “knows things are polarizing and they don't want to take major risks” on candidates and contentious issues.. For all the Biden team's work with celebrities, the president still tries to cultivate the image of someone in tune with ordinary people.. During a campaign swing through Saginaw, Michigan, the president visited a public golf course and met with community activist Coleman Hurley III and his son.. “The celebrities that have everything they want and they need, they may possibly be out of touch,"" the older Hurley said later in a phone interview.. As for ordinary Americans, Hurley added, Biden needs to be able to ""relate and see where they live ... and then have a conversation about some of the different struggles or issues that we, or other Americans, face.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,G7 leaders agree to lend Ukraine billions backed by Russia's frozen assets. Here's how it will work,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/g7-leaders-agree-lend-ukraine-billions-backed-russias-111080939,2024-06-13 00:38:15,"The leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival. WASHINGTON -- Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival that would use interest earned on profits from Russia’s frozen central bank assets as collateral. . Details of the deal were still being hashed out as G7 leaders gathered for a summit in Italy, but the money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year. That's according to a French official who confirmed the agreement Wednesday ahead of a formal announcement at the summit. Here's how the plan would work:. Most of the money would be provided in the form of a loan from the U.S. government that would be backed by windfall profits being earned on roughly $300 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of the money is being held in European Union nations.. A French official said that while the loan would be mostly U.S.-guaranteed, it could be “topped up” with European money or other national contributions. . That's much harder to do.. For more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.. The U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022 — basically, money being held in banks outside Russia. . The assets are immobilized and can’t be accessed by Moscow — but they still belong to Russia. . While governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court.. So the European Union instead has set aside the windfall profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access.. Separately, the U.S. earlier this year passed a law called the REPO Act — short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act — that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets located in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is still being worked out.. It will be up to technical experts to work through the details.. But U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday that the goal is “to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.”. Another goal is to get the money to Ukraine fast.. The French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out ""very quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.”. Beyond the costs of the war, the needs are great. The World Bank’s latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.. The move to unlock Russia's assets comes after there was a long delay by the U.S. Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine. . At an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said “the fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route.”. If Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds weren't generating enough interest to pay back the loan, ""then the question of burden-sharing arises,” according to the French official.. Who would shoulder the burden is still to be worked out, the official said.. Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that there were worries among European finance ministers that their countries “will be left holding the bag if Ukraine defaults.”. ___.

abcnews.com,Ukrainian winemakers visit California's Napa Valley to learn how to heal war-ravaged vineyards,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ukrainian-winemakers-visit-californias-napa-valley-learn-heal-111080940,2024-06-13 00:30:13,"A group of Ukrainian winemakers has visited California’s Napa Valley to learn about organic farming and how to heal land scarred by bombs and littered with mines. RUTHERFORD, Calif. -- As the head of an association of winemakers in southern Ukraine, Georgiy Molchanov knows a lot about how to cultivate grapes; not so much how to grow them amid undetonated mines.. But that was the situation he found himself in after a Russian rocket dropped the explosives on his vineyard near the port city of Mykolaiv in August 2022, six months after Russia invaded. The damage — and danger — the mines brought to his business marked one of the myriad catastrophic effects the more than 2-year-old war has had on the eastern European country. . Now, thanks to the combined efforts of the international nonprofit organization Roots of Peace, Rotary International, and the Grgich Hills Estate winery in Napa Valley, Molchanov is taking the steps he needs to reclaim and heal his wounded land. . First, Roots of Peace and Rotary International provided him with the expertise and supplies he needed to safely detonate the mines. Then, the groups teamed up to bring him and five other Ukrainian winemakers to Grgich Hills in Rutherford. During a weeklong stay here, they learned about regenerative organic farming, an agricultural method that prioritizes soil health and ecosystem balance.. “We are discussing how to bring nature, how to bring wines, not harm ... into this land,” said Molchanov, who heads the Association of Craft Winemakers in Ukraine’s Black Sea region. . He and his fellow entrepreneurs have another goal as well: to spread the message that, despite the ongoing war, the Ukrainian people remain resilient and look forward to life in peace.. “People in Ukraine are still alive,” said Svitlana Tsybak, Owner and CEO of Beykush Winery, also located in the Mykolaiv area. “Yes, war is in our soul, in our life, but we need ... to live our lives so, of course, we need to work.”. Tsybak said Russian troops are staked out about 4 miles (7 kilometers) from her vineyard but the war hasn’t directly affected her operations. Her winery started exporting wine to the United States six months ago. She said she wants to learn how to expand the presence of Ukrainian wine in the U.S. market.. Heidi Kuhn, a California peace activist who founded Roots of Peace, has worked for decades to remove landmines from war-ravaged land that she later helps to convert into vineyards, orchards and vegetable fields. Rotary International, which has collaborated for years with Roots of Peace, helped plan the program for the Ukrainian winemakers and funded their travel to California. . “There’s an estimated 110 million landmines in 60 countries, and today Ukraine tragically has over 30% of the land riddled with landmines,” said Kuhn, whose program is known as the “mines to vines” initiative.. In 2000, Kuhn worked with the founder of Grgich Hills Estate, the late Croatian immigrant Miljenko “Mike” Grgich, and other vintners to raise funds to clear landmines in Vukovar in eastern Croatia. The town, located in a winemaking region on the banks of the Danube, was reduced to rubble during the 1991-95 war in the former Yugoslavia.. Ivo Jeramaz, Grgich’s nephew, a native Croatian and a winemaker at Grgich Hills Estate, said he feels deeply for Ukrainians because he understands how heart-wrenching it is to live through war. He said the family winery has for decades helped Roots of Peace.. “This is just the beginning of a hopeful relationship to literally restore the health of this country,” he said. “I hope that not only they see how farming can be conducted without harmful chemicals, but also that they’re inspired and that their hope is elevated.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,"Trump is returning to Capitol Hill to meet with Republican lawmakers, a first since Jan. 6 attack",https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/trump-returning-capitol-hill-meet-republican-lawmakers-jan-111080942,2024-06-13 00:54:16,"Donald Trump is making a triumphant return to Capitol Hill to meet with House and Senate Republicans for the first time since the Jan. 6, 2021 attack. WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump is making a triumphant return to Capitol Hill to meet with House and Senate Republicans, his first since sending the mob to “fight like hell” ahead of the Jan.6, 2021 attack, as GOP lawmakers find themselves newly energized and reinvigorated by his bid to retake the White House.. Despite the federal charges against Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrives Thursday emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee. He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign. . “We’re excited to welcome President Trump back,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, who led one of the lawsuits challenging the 2020 election, and had his biggest fundraising day yet after Trump's felony conviction. . The Republican speaker demurred over whether he’s asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. “Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.”. Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks to both groups at the House and Senate campaign headquarters near the U.S. Capitol and discuss issues animating his campaign — including mass immigration deportations but also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term. . In between, Trump is expected to speak at the Business Roundtable downtown which routinely invites the presumptive presidential nominees to address the executives' group. Many potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda. . But the private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump’s return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.. “It’s frustrating,” said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election.. Dunn spoke of the “irony” of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. “It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they’re truly putting party and person over country,"" he said. ""And it’s sad.”. Many of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.. Johnson met with senators on Wednesday ahead of Trump's arrival as the Republicans mapped out potential priorities.. Outgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the “disgraceful” attack that he called an “insurrection” now endorses the party’s presumptive nominee and said: ""Of course I’ll be at the meeting.”. Sen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he’s interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election and “ways in which we, as a team, and him individually can appeal to the constituencies and people that may not traditionally vote Republican.”. Thune said, “I think there’s an opportunity there to really make this a big win.”. As democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.. “This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.. Making Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as “warriors” and “patriots,” and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.. Moreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.. Republicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.. Alongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case. . When former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn’t be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.. “Paul Ryan, you’re a piece of garbage,"" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. ""We should kick you out of the party.”. Of the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.. But Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting ""he’s going to be the next president, so you have to work” together.. Asked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: “Let the day’s own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.”. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.. “Look, we’ve got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we’re like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,” Tillis said.. ___.

abcnews.com,"Ozy Media went from buzzy to belly-up. Its founder, Carlos Watson, is now on trial",https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ozy-media-buzzy-belly-founder-carlos-watson-now-111080571,2024-06-13 00:22:15,"For nearly a decade, Ozy Media projected an image of new-media success. NEW YORK -- For nearly a decade, Ozy Media projected an image of new-media success.. The company boasted big-name interviews, an Emmy-winning TV show, a buzzy music and ideas festival and impressive numbers to show prospective investors — until it imploded in 2021 amid doubts about its audience size, viability and basic integrity.. Those doubts are now at the center of a federal criminal trial. Founder Carlos Watson and Ozy are fighting charges of conspiracy to commit fraud.. Even after numerous other public and court reckonings for Silicon Valley companies that went from ballyhooed to belly-up, it's hard to forget the moment in Ozy's downfall when co-founder Samir Rao impersonated a YouTube executive to talk up the company to prospective investors.. Watson's and Ozy's lawyers blame any misrepresentations solely on Rao, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and to identity theft. The defense also has claimed that prosecutors are casting commonplace entrepreneurial puffery as a crime and singling out Watson, a Black founder in a tech world where African American executives have been disproportionately few.. “I am not now and never have been a ‘con man,’” he declared when indicted last year.. Prosecutors and Rao, their star witness, say Ozy shredded the line between hopeful hype and bald-faced deceit.. “We told so many lies to so many different people,” Rao testified after recounting how a teetering company concocted rosy financials in a desperate bid to lure investors and stay in business.. The hope was to enable “a diverse audience, to consume, hopefully, a different, more meaningful kind of content,” he said. But “survival within the bonds of decency, fairness, truth, it morphed into survival at all costs and by any means necessary."". Ozy was founded in 2012 on a Millennial-friendly premise of providing a fresh, sophisticated-but-not-stuffy take on politics, culture and more — billed as “the new and the next” — while amplifying minority and marginalized voices.. A Harvard and Stanford-educated son of two South Florida teachers, Watson had worked on Wall Street, started and sold a test-prep company and anchored on MSNBC. He conceived of Ozy and then recruited Rao, a former finance-world colleague, after a chance meeting at a Chipotle restaurant in Silicon Valley, according to Rao.. Ozy debuted with a website, newsletters and a bang: Former President Bill Clinton was one of its first interviewees. The company expanded into podcasts, events and TV shows, winning a 2020 Emmy for the Watson-hosted “Black Women OWN the Conversation,” on the Oprah Winfrey Network. The annual Ozy Fest in New York's Central Park drew big names ranging from John Legend to a pre-presidency Joe Biden.. The company attracted a roster of major advertisers, clients and grants, according to testimony. But behind the scenes, prosecutors say, Ozy started bleeding money in 2018 and began trying to save itself with lies.. The company told a prospective investor it “finished 2017 with approximately 12 million in revenue” but gave its accountants a number under $7 million. The gaps widened with the years, yawning to as much as $53 million-vs.-$11 million for 2020, according to testimony and documents shown at trial.. Meanwhile, Ozy frequently delayed paying vendors and rent, borrowed against future receipts to get pricey cash advances and struggled to make payroll, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre testified.. The defense portrayed the cash scrambles as the growing pains of a successful startup.. ""Ozy Media did not defraud its investors or anyone else,” said the company's lawyer, Shannon Frison.. Watson lawyer and Harvard Law School Professor Ronald Sullivan Jr. said his client “believed every number that he gave every investor.” Sullivan suggested revenue figures could vary depending on whether they account for such “in-kind” income as trading ads with another outlet.. Poutre testified that auditors rarely agree to count such revenue and she did not feel Watson was always honest.. “I don’t know where his numbers came from. I know where my numbers came from,"" she said.. The alleged schemes went beyond questionable numbers.. While trying to get Ozy a bank loan in 2020, Rao faked a contract saying that Winfrey’s OWN network had renewed “Black Women OWN The Conversation” for a second season. When the bank wanted information directly from the network, Rao set up a phony email account for a real OWN executive and used it to offer the bank ""background on the transaction.”. Rao told jurors that Watson verbally approved the charade. Jurors saw a text message from Watson exhorting Rao to “be bold, get it done,” but the ”it"" wasn't specified. Ultimately, witnesses said, neither the loan nor the show renewal happened.. Rao's infamous phone call came the next year as Ozy sought an investment from Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs. He'd falsely claimed YouTube was paying for Watson's eponymous talk show. When Goldman bankers wanted confirmation, he downloaded a voice-modifying app and pretended to be a YouTube executive on a call with them.. But the bankers were wary, the real YouTube exec soon found out and Watson told Goldman Sachs and Ozy's board that his co-founder had suffered a mental breakdown.. The investment didn’t materialize, but Goldman Sachs continued advertising with Ozy after the episode, Rao said.. Rao told jurors he was taking antidepressants but was not having a psychiatric crisis when he made the call. Watson was present and coaching him via text message, Rao said.. “I am a big fan of Carlos, Samir and the show,” reads one text, which Rao explained as Watson feeding him a line for his phony persona to say. Then Watson urged, “use the right pronouns. You are NOT OZY,” among other messages.. Watson’s lawyer said the Ozy founder stumbled upon Rao’s deceit midstream, was appalled and signaled him to hang up.. The defense has emphasized that Rao drafted a 2021 letter — ultimately unsent — saying the phone ruse was his alone. Rao told jurors he wrote it to protect the company.. Defense lawyers have cast him as an incompetent executive, confessed fabricator and admitted criminal who's falsely implicating Watson in hopes of avoiding prison for his own crimes.. “So, Mr. Rao, you're a liar, right?” Sullivan asked during cross-examination last Friday.. “Regrettably,"" Rao replied, “I've told many lies in my time at Ozy.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Republican Party rifts on display in Virginia congressional primary pitting Good and McGuire,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/republican-party-rifts-display-virginia-congressional-primary-pitting-111080572,2024-06-13 00:14:16,"Bob Good is fighting a two-front battle to hold his seat in Virginia's 5th Congressional District. CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- Bob Good is fighting a two-front battle to hold his seat in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District and with it his role as leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. And that doesn't even count his opponent in the June 18 GOP primary, state Sen. John McGuire.. Good, who played a key role in the ouster of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has drawn the ire of establishment Republicans, who are bankrolling a campaign to oust him.. More significantly, he's also lost the support of former President Donald Trump, who is endorsing McGuire. Good fell out of favor with Trump when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the 2024 presidential nomination. . Good switched his endorsement to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but that failed to assuage the former president. On social media, Trump called Good “BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA."" Trump acknowledged that Good eventually gave him an endorsement, but it was too late: ""The damage has been done.”. Trump has escalated the attacks in recent days. He issued a video endorsing McGuire and warning that Good “will stab you in the back like he did me.”. McGuire has echoed the attacks, calling Good a “never Trumper,” putting Good on the defensive.. Good, for his part, says he considers Trump “the best president of my lifetime.” He says he endorsed DeSantis because he wanted a candidate who could serve two terms, and Trump is constitutionally eligible to serve only one more term.. He attacks McGuire as a serial campaigner who always has his eye on the next job.. McGuire ran for the state Senate in 2023, and within a week of winning a four-year term there announced he was running for Good's seat in Congress. In 2022, he ran for Congress in another district, the 7th, but later withdrew. In 2021, he ran for the House of Delegates and won. In 2020, he lost a primary race for the 7th District. . “He's literally a perpetual candidate in search of a race,” Good said. . Good, on the other hand, has a relatively short political resume. He served on the Campbell County Board of Supervisors, and then took on incumbent Republican congressman Denver Riggleman in 2020. He defeated Riggleman at a nominating convention as Riggleman faced blowback among social conservatives for officiating a same-sex wedding. . Good is facing payback for his efforts in McCarthy's ouster. The Republican political action committee Defending Main Street, which almost always spends money to support GOP incumbents, launched a $450,000 ad campaign against Good. . “We spend 99% of our money protecting incumbents and adding more mainstream conservatives to the House, but this was a unique situation,” said Sarah Chamberlain, the group’s president and CEO.. Good said he believes the massive ad campaigns against him are the only reason the race is close but that voters don’t care he voted for McCarthy’s ouster.. He said McCarthy “is on his revenge tour now, and I’m his biggest target.”. It might have seemed inconceivable that an incumbent with the conservative record of Good could be vulnerable in a primary, but Alex Keena, political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, said the race “has just captured the dynamics in the Republican Party right now really well.”. He said Good has “put himself on an island,” alienating mainstream Republicans by ousting McCarthy. And he lost the Trump voters because, “I guess he betrayed Trump, which is really easy to do.”. Good put it simply: McGuire, he said, “is not running to the right of me. He’s running to the Trump of me.”. McGuire and his campaign did not respond to multiple calls and emails seeking an interview.. The race has splintered the far-right Freedom Caucus, for which Good serves as chairman. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz has come to the district to support Good, while Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene campaigned for McGuire.. At a rally last week in Charlottesville — the most liberal part of the district — a few dozen McGuire supporters were outnumbered by 75 to 100 protesters who swarmed around McGuire and Greene when they got off a campaign bus.. Any efforts by McGuire and Greene to speak were drowned out by protestors chanting “Go Home!” and waving signs that said “No hate in our state.”. Neither McGuire nor Greene seemed to mind, with McGuire smiling through the chaos and Greene blowing kisses to her detractors as they responded with middle fingers.. McGuire, asked what he made of the scene, smiled and said, “Freedom!” as he retreated back to his bus.. McGuire supporters at the rally indicated that their support for the candidate stems primarily from their disappointment with Good.. “Good is a backstabber,"" said Nelson County resident Kerry Williams Thornton. ”I was with Good two years ago. ... But you cannot go with DeSantis and think that Trump is going to have your back."". 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

GENEVA -- The head of the U.N. refugee agency says he understands that the Biden administration enacted new restrictions on asylum-seekers entering the United States, but cautioned that some aspects of the executive order may violate refugee protection required in international law.. Filippo Grandi, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, spoke to The Associated Press as his agency issued its annual “Global Trends” report for 2023 on Thursday. It found that the cumulative number of people who have been subjected to forced displacement rose to 120 million people in 2023 — 6 million more than in the year before.. The refugee agency noted that the total count was roughly equivalent to the entire population of Japan. . The UNHCR report found that three-fourths of those people forcibly displaced – including both refugees driven abroad and people displaced inside their own countries – lived in poor or middle-income countries. Grandi insisted that was a sign of how migrant and refugee flows were not just an issue for the rich world.. He lamented how crises in Africa had been largely overlooked, in particular in Sudan, where some 10.8 million were displaced at the end of last year, after conflict erupted between forces loyal to rival generals in April last year.. Grandi said the world’s focus on crises faced by refugees and internally displaced people has largely centered on Gaza -- where a devastating and deadly conflict erupted in October last year -- and Ukraine, which has been saddled by Russia’s invasion since February 2022.. He lamented how the world has largely overlooked the refugee crisis spawned by the conflict in Sudan.. The United States, meanwhile, has faced the “most complex challenge” when it comes to refugees of any country in the developed world, Grandi said — alluding to an influx across the U.S.-Mexican border. . The U.N. refugee agency chief criticized Biden administration plans to enact new restrictions on migrants seeking asylum at the border — seen by some as a political maneuver ahead of national elections in November — as a possible violation of international humanitarian law.. But he acknowledged that Biden administration ambitions to resettle some 125,000 refugees in the United States amounted to “a very shining example of U.S. generosity.”. UNHCR also highlighted difficulties faced by refugees and internally displaced people amid conflict in countries like Congo and Myanmar, and noted that Syria remains the world's largest displacement crisis with nearly 14 million people forcibly displaced both inside the country and abroad. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Arizona lawmakers agree to let voters decide on retention rules for state Supreme Court justices,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/arizona-lawmakers-agree-voters-decide-retention-rules-state-111078279,2024-06-12 21:26:28,"Arizona lawmakers have voted to send an initiative to the November ballot that would protect two state Supreme Court justices targeted for removal over their support for a near-total abortion ban. PHOENIX -- Arizona lawmakers voted Wednesday to send an initiative to the November ballot that would protect two state Supreme Court justices targeted for removal from the bench over their support for a near-total abortion ban dating back to the Civil War. . Both chambers of the Legislature agreed to allow voters to decide Nov. 5 whether to eliminate the terms of six years for Supreme Court justices and four years for Superior Court judges in large counties. That will allow them to serve indefinitely “during good behavior,” unless decided otherwise by a judicial review commission, and avoid a retention vote on the ballot each time their term ends. . As a ballot initiative, the proposed law would bypass Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, a strong supporter of reproductive rights who signed a Legislature-approved repeal of the 1864 law this spring.. Several Democrats who voted against the measure noted that the retention rules were championed by the late former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who had been an Arizona state senator and Superior Court and Appellate Court judge. . The retention system “provides the kinds of checks and balances critical to our democracy,” said Sen. Flavio Bravo. “It would be a shame to take this action six months after Justice Day O'Connor's passing, and I vote no.” . Republican Sen. Dave Gowan, the bill's sponsor, noted that judges would still be subject to judicial review by a committee “to say if they don't belong.” . The measure will likely appear on the ballot alongside an initiative that would enshrine the right to abortion in the Arizona Constitution. . The final Senate vote on the judicial ballot initiative was 16-10, with four senators not voting. Republican Sen. Shawnna Bolick, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, ignored requests by several colleagues to recuse herself and voted in favor. . Justices Bolick and Kathryn Hackett King joined the majority on the high court in April in voting to restore the 1864 abortion ban. They are the only two on the Supreme Court who are up for retention votes in November. . Both were appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who expanded the court from five to seven justices in 2016. . If approved by voters, the measure would apply retroactively to Oct. 31, days before the election, and would effectively throw out the results of any vote on judicial retention this year. . If it fails and voters also opt to unseat Hackett King and Bolick, Hobbs can pick their replacements. . “They definitely are ramming it through,” said Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for Progress Arizona, a group advocating for the judges' removal. “We will continue to do our work to inform the voters that this will take away their power.”. Democrats have put abortion at the center of their quest to take control of the state Legislature for the first time in decades. Sen. Bolick, representing one of the most competitive districts, is a key target.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

PHOENIX -- A firearms dealer in Arizona sold weapons to an undercover federal agent he believed would help him carry out his plan for a mass shooting targeting minorities, an attack that he hoped would “incite a race war,” according to a federal grand jury indictment. . Mark Adams Prieto was indicted Tuesday by the grand jury in Arizona on charges of firearms trafficking, transferring a firearm for use in a hate crime, and possession of an unregistered firearm.. Court records didn't list an attorney who could comment on Prieto's behalf. A lawyer who briefly represented Prieto after he was arrested last month in neighboring New Mexico didn't respond Wednesday to a request for comment.. The indictment says the 58-year-old from Prescott, Arizona, recruited the undercover FBI agent and an informant at a gun show where Prieto was a vendor.. According to the indictment, Prieto told them he'd been thinking about carrying out a mass killing of minority groups for some time in order “to incite a race war” ahead of the presidential election in November. Prieto later identified a rap concert in Atlanta in mid-May for the attack, the indictment alleges.. The indictment says planning for the shooting began in January and took place over several months at gun shows around Arizona, including in Phoenix and Tucson. At the gun shows, the indictment alleges, Prieto sold two rifles to be used in the shooting to the FBI agent.. Prieto was arrested in New Mexico on May 14 — around the time of the Atlanta concert — while driving east from Arizona. Authorities said they found seven firearms inside his vehicle.. Following his arrest, court records show, a U.S. district judge in New Mexico ordered Prieto to remain in federal custody, saying the “seriousness of danger to the community is extreme” if he was to be released.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,DeSantis appointees bury the hatchet with Disney by approving new development deal,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/desantis-appointees-bury-hatchet-disney-approving-new-development-111077850,2024-06-12 21:34:29,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees have given final approval to an agreement that buries the hatchet between Disney and the governing district for Walt Disney World. ORLANDO, Fla. -- Gov. Ron DeSantis' appointees on Wednesday gave final approval to an agreement that buries the hatchet between Disney and the governing district for Walt Disney World, which the Florida governor took over after the company two years ago publicly opposed a state law critics dubbed “Don't Say Gay.”. The five DeSantis-appointed board members to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District unanimously voted to approve a 15-year development deal in which the district committed to making infrastructure improvements in exchange for Disney investing up to $17 billion into Disney World over the next two decades.. The agreement followed a detente in March in which both sides agreed to stop litigating each other in state court and work towards negotiating a new development agreement and a new comprehensive plan no later than next year. The district provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, among other things, and was controlled by Disney supporters before the takeover by the DeSantis appointees.. District board member Brian Aungst said at Wednesday night's board meeting that the agreement provides a lasting and stable framework for Disney and the board to work together.. “This is the day we all have been looking forward to,” Aungst said. “I was always extremely optimistic and knew we would get here because it was the right outcome.”. Under the deal, Disney will be required to donate up to 100 acres (40 hectares) of Disney World’s 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) for the construction of infrastructure projects controlled by the district. The company also will need to award at least half of its construction projects to companies based in Florida and spend at least $10 million on affordable housing for central Florida.. Disney would then be approved to build a fifth major theme park at Disney World and two more minor parks, such as water parks, if it desired. The company could raise the number of hotel rooms on its property from almost 40,000 rooms to more than 53,000 rooms and increase the amount of retail and restaurant space by more than 20%. Disney will retain control of building heights due to its need to maintain an immersive environment.. Leaders of Orlando's tourism industry praised the agreement, telling the district's board members that it will bring boundless jobs, tourists and attention to central Florida.. “It very clearly demonstrates to the world that the district and Disney are eager to resume working together for the great state of Florida,” said Robert Earl, founder and CEO of Planet Hollywood International, Inc.. Still up in the air was an appeal of a federal lawsuit Disney had filed against DeSantis and his appointees. After the settlement was reached in March, Disney asked the appellate court to put that case on hold while the development agreement was negotiated. The company has until next week to file a brief with the court if it wants to move ahead with the case.. Disney didn't respond to an email Wednesday afternoon seeking comment on how the company planned to proceed. The DeSantis appointees to the district had planned to hold a closed-door discussion about the lawsuit after their board meeting Wednesday but cancelled that meeting.. Matthew Oberly, a spokesperson for the district, said Wednesday night that the district didn't have any comment on the future of the federal litigation. . The March settlement ended almost two years of litigation sparked by DeSantis’ takeover of the district following the company’s opposition to the 2022 law that bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by the Republican governor, who used Disney as a punching bag in speeches during his run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination until he suspended his campaign earlier this year.. As punishment for Disney’s opposition to the controversial law, DeSantis took over the governing district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors. Disney sued DeSantis and his appointees, claiming the company’s free speech rights were violated for speaking out against the legislation. A federal judge dismissed that lawsuit in January, but Disney appealed.. Before control of the district changed hands early last year, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with the company shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees claimed the “eleventh-hour deals” neutered their powers, and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided.. Disney filed counterclaims that included asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable. Those state court lawsuits were dismissed as part of the March settlement.. ___.

abcnews.com,The Trump campaign opens a new outreach office in a heavily Latino part of Pennsylvania,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/trump-campaign-opens-new-outreach-office-heavily-latino-111077039,2024-06-12 21:50:18,"President Donald Trump’s campaign has teamed up with the Republican National Committee and the Pennsylvania GOP to open a “Latino Americans for Trump” office in Reading. READING, Pa. -- The pastor opened with a prayer in Spanish, asking that the Lord's spirit and guidance direct the proceedings without offering an English translation. Most of the around 50 attendees were white and weren't appearing to follow along, though they knew enough to sing out “Amen!” at the end. . Thus began former President Donald Trump 's campaign teaming up with the Republican National Committee and Pennsylvania GOP to open a “Latino Americans for Trump” office Wednesday in the town of Reading. . “We believe in the American Dream and the only way to obtain the American Dream is working hard,” Luis Fortuno, the former governor of Puerto Rico, told the same crowd. For the smaller group of Spanish speakers present, he followed with remarks that leaned heavily on the theme of “Necesitamos cambio” — Spanish for “We need change.”. Trump and top Republicans are looking to boost their support among Hispanic voters in a swing state that could well decide the election. Having shuttered many party offices that specialized in minority outreach, they are betting that promises to prioritize entrepreneurship and smaller government can resonate with a voting bloc that historically has favored Democrats. . Reading is perhaps best known as the namesake for the Reading Railroad from the Monopoly gameboard. A town of about 95,000 around 65 miles northwest of Philadelphia, Reading is 67% Latino, according to U.S. Census figures, and home to high concentrations of people of Dominican and Puerto Rican heritage. . Biden’s approval rating has dropped among Hispanic adults in national polls, but it remains unclear if Trump can capitalize.. The Reading office opening comes a week after Trump’s campaign established its first Pennsylvania office at a site in northeast Philadelphia. That event was billed as a “Blacks for Trump” gathering and featured Republican Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt and other prominent Black Republicans. . Both in Philadelphia and in Reading on Wednesday, most of the attendees were white. . Trump himself held a rally meant to energize Latino support on Sunday in Las Vegas, where he quipped: “We need every voter. I don’t care about you, I just want your vote.” The former president also said immigrants were turning the U.S. “into a dumping ground” and vowed, “We’re not going to let them destroy our country.”. President Joe Biden ’s campaign says Trump is dealing in dangerous and racist stereotypes and has dismissed his campaign's office openings as superficial patronizing of minority voters.. Biden's reelection campaign, together with the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, has opened 24 offices and has 100-plus staffers across the state, and has spent months organizing house parties and other voter mobilization efforts. It has been spending on ads in Pennsylvania since late last summer with a special emphasis on voters of Puerto Rican or Caribbean heritage. . Yrene Rodriguez, 46, an accountant at Reading Community College who said she and her whole family are Biden supporters, dismissed Wednesday's efforts by Trump's backers as “just propaganda.”. “They just want to get people to say nice things about him,” Rodriguez said. . Luis Rodriguez, who owns a real estate wholesaling and rehabbing business with offices in Pennsylvania, addressed the Trump office opening and talked about the importance of extending the U.S.-Mexico border wall, a signature promise from Trump's first campaign that he pursued in office. . Asked after the event about concerns Trump's harsh personal rhetoric might alienate some Hispanics, Rodriguez, who isn’t related to Yrene, said such suggestions don't have ""any backing or validity.”. Michael Rivera, a commissioner in Berks County, which encompasses Reading, spoke at the office opening in English and Spanish and said more effort to reach out to Hispanic voters ""demonstrates the Republican Party's understanding of the power of diversity among the American people.” . Located in a red-brick building across from a downtown CVS, the campaign office was indistinguishable from most corporate spaces, except for the placards in the front window reading “Latino Americans for Trump,"" “Stop Illegal Voting” and “Joe Biden, You’re Fired.”. Attracting more attention was a table of Trump merchandise set up for the event on the sidewalk outside. Some people walking by rolled their eyes or voiced their objections, but others were delighted with the display. . “I only want the true king. The true king of America!"" bellowed one man, loud enough to be heard inside the office. “That's Trump.” . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Runner-up criticizes Nevada GOP Senate nominee Sam Brown while other former rivals back him,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/runner-criticizes-nevada-gop-senate-nominee-sam-brown-111077038,2024-06-12 22:22:21,"Nevada GOP Senate Republican runner-up Jeff Gunter has continued his attacks on the nominee and retired Army Capt. Sam Brown. RENO, Nev. -- The bitter primary that saw nearly a dozen Republican Senate candidates swipe at retired Army Capt. Sam Brown is fading out of view for some, who say their quest to take down incumbent Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen trumps any intra-party grievances from the past 11 months.. Not runner-up Jeff Gunter.. “The America First faithful had zero interest in campaigning with him through the entire primary season where he relied on establishment influence and money to slide into a nomination,” Gunter said Wednesday after his distant second-place finish. . The dermatologist and former Trump-appointed Iceland ambassador continued to attack Brown as the establishment candidate in a lengthy statement in which he predicted outright that Rosen would win another term in November. . Gunter’s criticism could complicate early GOP efforts to coalesce around Brown. And it comes as the state Republican Party looks to move past the intra-party rifts in the primary to pivot into what is set to be among the most closely-watched Senate races of the year.. Gunter said former President Donald Trump's late endorsement of Brown, which came in a social media post hours after he appeared in Nevada before the primary, would not be enough to convince loyal Republicans to support the nominee, who avoided debates and did not engage with the other 11 candidates in the race.. “The base is smart and they do not forget and I think he has a lot to prove before earning their support,” Gunter said.. One of Gunter’s most high-profile supporters, Nevada GOP national committeewoman Sigal Chattah, struck a different tone. She said Wednesday that a historic precedent where Nevada Republicans detract from Republican nominees they don't like “died last night.” . ""Any attempts to marginalize the candidate that was elected will be met with fierce dissent from the party,” Chattah said.. For months, Brown faced criticism from within his own party, who chastised him for skipping debates, flipping his position on the status of the mothballed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, and called him the hand-picked establishment candidate of national Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Brown’s absence became more of a theme than any one policy at primary debates, with candidates explicitly urging voters not to cast their ballots for Brown.. Some of those criticisms echoed Brown’s own messaging from two years ago, when he ran in the Republican primary against Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who garnered dozens of high-profile endorsements. Laxalt defeated Brown in the primary but then lost to Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto by 8,000 votes, clinching the Senate majority for Democrats.. Chattah had previously criticized Brown for a “lack of integrity” and had pointed to a CNN report that Brown had created a political action committee to help other Republicans, then funneled the money to pay off his unsuccessful 2022 campaign. She said in an interview that her mission now is to defeat Rosen, and discouraged other Republicans from attacking Brown moving forward.. “I don’t do take-backs. So that was my sentiment,” she said when asked about the report. “Regardless of my sentiment, I’m the RNC committeewoman, and I’m a Republican. And I will support the Republican candidate unequivocally.”. Brown did not acknowledge his opponents in his victory speech on Tuesday and instead focused his attention on Rosen and President Joe Biden. . Brown's campaign again did that in a Wednesday statement when asked about Gunter's comments.. “Nevada voters are clearly united behind our grassroots campaign to end the Biden-Rosen American Nightmare. And that is what we're 100% focused on,” said communications director Kristy Wilkinson..  Trump's endorsement of Brown two days before the primary was a blow to many opponents who had angled to align themselves with the former president, but none more so than Gunter, who had branded himself as “110% pro-Trump.”. In a Monday post on X, between Trump's endorsement and Brown's commanding victory, Gunter suggested that Trump, or the people around him, got a “big check” from “the swamp” for endorsing Brown.. Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita addressed Gunter directly in his response, saying: “You have a habit of making up crap. President Trump makes his own decisions and this is another example of him choosing wisely.”. Among Brown’s opponents and detractors was former lieutenant governor candidate and Air Force veteran Tony Grady, who had campaigned for Brown during his 2022 insurgent run before running against him this cycle. More recently, Grady had called Brown a “phony politician.”. Grady said he saw Brown “out among the people” more in 2022 than in his 2024 campaign, and that skipping debates was not “necessarily putting a best foot forward.”. “But the reality is, he had a plan for running his campaign and it was successful,” said Grady, who endorsed Brown immediately after his loss and said Brown should have the votes of his supporters moving forward. “At this point, it doesn’t really matter what my thoughts are about him skipping debates. He was successful in winning the primary.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,"Neil Goldschmidt, former Oregon governor who confessed to sex with a minor in the 1970s, has died",https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/neil-goldschmidt-former-oregon-governor-confessed-sex-minor-111076665,2024-06-12 23:10:15,"Neil Goldschmidt, a former Oregon governor whose confession that he had sex with a 14-year-old girl in the 1970s blackened what had been a nearly sterling reputation, has died. Former Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, who as mayor of Portland was credited with starting the city on its path to becoming a magnet for the young, hip and liberal but whose reputation unraveled after it was revealed he had a yearslong affair with an aide’s teenage daughter, has died. He was 83.. Goldschmidt died at his Portland home on Wednesday, The Oregonian reported, according to family members. The newspaper said the cause was heart failure.. Between converting a busy highway into a popular riverfront park and developing the seeds of a robust public transit system, Portland’s fuzzy-haired, sideburned mayor had a secret double life. For years in the 1970s, he engaged in an illegal sexual relationship with the teenage daughter of an aide.. At 32, Goldschmidt was elected the youngest mayor of a major American city in 1972. Seven years later, he left City Hall to become President Jimmy Carter’s transportation secretary. He served one term as Oregon governor, from 1987 to 1991.. Goldschmidt announced in 1990 that he and his wife, Margie, were separating and he wouldn’t seek a second term, saying, “It will require more of myself than I am prepared to give.” He never sought elected office again. The decision by one of Oregon’s most revered politicians was shocking, and left many wondering why he’d walk away from a career on the rise.. The question may have been answered when Goldschmidt admitted on March 6, 2004, that while he was mayor, he had a sexual relationship that began when the girl was 14. Under Oregon law at the time, the sexual encounters would have been considered statutory rape because of the girl’s age, but he escaped punishment because the statute of limitations had expired.. Goldschmidt confessed to The Oregonian as the rival Willamette Week was preparing to publish an article revealing the abuse. He claimed the relationship — which he called an “affair” — lasted for about a year. Later newspaper reports showed it had lasted as long as three years. In interviews that were published after her death in 2011, the woman told newspapers that it actually continued for more than a decade and contributed to a tragic life of alcohol and drug abuse.. The abuse was revealed months after Goldschmidt had assumed two high-profile positions: as chairman of the Oregon Board of Higher Education and as a point man for a Texas firm trying to acquire Portland General Electric. He retreated from public life.. “In the 35 years since I failed this young woman, her family, and my family, the pain has never eased,” Goldschmidt told The Oregonian in an email after the victim died in 2011.. When the abuse became public, Goldschmidt’s portrait was moved from a prominent place in the state Capitol to a hidden library. In 2011, it was put in storage at the state historical society.. The scandal reverberated among Oregon’s political elite, where rumors circulated about who knew Goldschmidt’s secret and kept it quiet.. As governor, Goldschmidt led the state as it recovered from nearly eight years of recession following the decline of the timber industry. He was credited with reforming Oregon’s workers’ compensation system and pursuing international trade opportunities.. Goldschmidt was born in Eugene on June 16, 1940. After graduating from South Eugene High School, Goldschmidt attended the University of Oregon, where he received a degree in political science in 1963.. As student body president, he went straight to then-Gov. Mark Hatfield to seek more support for higher education. At law school in Berkeley, California, Goldschmidt pushed for campus reforms and marched for civil rights in Mississippi.. “He was like a machine gun,” Hatfield once told The Oregonian. “He had as many ideas as the trigger would pull.”. A legal aid attorney in Portland from 1967 to 1969, Goldschmidt began his political career as a city commissioner in 1971 and was elected mayor the following year. . Goldschmidt was known as a civic visionary. During the Goldschmidt era, Portland’s widely praised light-rail transit system was conceived and built. He fostered strong neighborhoods and provided the spark for downtown revitalization.. Portland sports fans recall Bill Walton drenching him with beer after the Trail Blazers won their first — and only — NBA championship in 1977.. He left in 1979 to run the U.S. Department of Transportation, earning national acclaim for helping to bail out ailing automaker Chrysler Corp. After Carter lost his reelection bid, Goldschmidt returned to Oregon, where he headed Canadian operations for athletic apparel giant Nike, Inc.. In 1986, Goldschmidt entered the Oregon governor’s race, which saw him locked with Republican Norma Paulus in one of the state’s closest gubernatorial contests.. The campaign was conducted against the backdrop of the state’s continuing economic distress and high unemployment. Goldschmidt, buoyed by support from the business community and his own business experience, won with 52 percent of the vote. Analysts attributed his victory to his economic program and to his record of cutting crime as mayor of Portland.. In office, Goldschmidt was willing to place more emphasis on economic growth and less on environmental protection, a reversal of state policies of a decade earlier when many residents feared growth.. He also issued an executive order that gave gays protected civil rights status within state government. Voters, however, revoked that order in 1988.. His governorship didn’t win universal praise. Critics said his words outran his accomplishments and others said he lacked patience and had become bored with bureaucracy. He was also dogged by the highly publicized murder of a state prison official, which led to allegations of corruption in the prison system.. An independent investigation ordered by Goldschmidt uncovered problems in the prison system, but no links to the murder.. After leaving office, he founded the Oregon Children’s Foundation and volunteered for its literacy program in the schools. He served on many commissions and boards and started his own law practice in downtown Portland, which focused on strategic planning.. He is survived by his second wife, Diana Snowden; their daughter; two children from a previous marriage; and a stepchild.. —-.

China's military has grown massively in recent years, and it now boasts the world's largest navy, an air force with cutting-edge stealth fighters and a gigantic missile force that appears intended to back the country's claims to the self-governing island of Taiwan, the South China Sea and disputed islands controlled by Japan, and ultimately driving its major rival the U.S. out of the region. . In response, the U.S. has strengthened ties with allies such as Australia, the Philippines, Japan and South Korea, while boosting arms sales and military cooperation with Taiwan. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Milei's radical overhaul advances in Argentina's Senate as protesters clash with police,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/argentinas-senate-accepted-president-mileis-radical-overhaul-now-111081880,2024-06-13 03:34:25,"Argentina’s Senate began what’s likely to be an all-night voting marathon on the details of President Javier Milei’s sweeping proposals to slash spending and boost his own powers after giving the plan overall approval in a narrow vote. BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina's Senate began what's likely to be an all-night voting marathon on the details of President Javier Milei 's sweeping proposals to slash spending and boost his own powers early Thursday, shortly after giving the plan overall approval in a narrow vote as thousands of protesters clashed with police outside.. Senators voted 37 to 36 late Wednesday to give provisional approval to the two bills after a daylong heated debate while thousands of protesters poured into the streets, burning cars and throwing Molotov cocktails as hundreds of federal security forces pushed back with rounds of tear gas and water cannons. . The vote — decided by a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Victoria Villarruel — delivered a major boost to Milei, whose efforts to overhaul the government and economy have run into tough resistance in Argentina's opposition-dominated Congress. . “Tonight is a triumph for the Argentine people and the first step toward the recovery of our greatness,"" Milei posted on X, calling his bills “the most most ambitious legislative reform of the last 40 years.” . But critical elements of the wide-ranging legislation still have to survive an article-by-article vote in the Senate. After that, the bill heads back to the lower house, where lawmakers must okay any modifications before Milei can officially claim his first legislative victory.. Right-wing and left-wing lawmakers have clashed over various parts of the 238-article state reform bill, including the declaration of a one-year state of emergency and delegation of broad powers to the president in energy, pensions, security and other matters until the end of Milei's term in 2027. . Other controversial measures include an incentive scheme that would give investors lucrative tax breaks for 30 years. . Milei is a political outsider with just two years' experience as a lawmaker, and his 3-year-old party, Liberty Advances, holds just 15% of seats in the lower house and 10% of the Senate. . He has been unable to pass a single piece of legislation in his six months of presidency, raising questions about whether he can execute his ambitious project to trim the deficit and spur growth. Instead, he's used executive powers to slash subsidies, fire thousands of public employees, devalue the currency and deregulate parts of the Argentine economy.. The spending cuts and currency devaluation that Milei has delivered have — at least in the short term — deepened a recession, increased poverty to 55% and sent annual inflation surging toward 300%. . “If this law passes, we are going to lose so many of our labor and pension rights,” said 54-year-old teacher Miriam Rajovitcher, protesting ahead of the vote alongside colleagues who say they’ve had to reconfigure their lives since Milei slashed school budgets and devalued the currency. “I am so much worse off.” . Analysts say the promised benefits of Milei's reforms — a stable currency, tamer inflation, fresh foreign investment — won't materialize without a political consensus to convince foreign investors that his changes are here to stay. Milei's administration has said it wants to strike a new deal with the International Monetary Fund, to which Argentina already owes $44 billion.. “Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode,” said Marcelo J. García, Americas director at geopolitical risk firm Horizon Engage. “Investors say, ’Yes, we love what you’re saying, but we need to see that this is sustainable.” . Milei's allies said they had made tough concessions Wednesday. His party, Liberty Advances, agreed not to sell off the country's post office, flagship airline Aerolíneas Argentinas, or the public radio service, leaving just a handful of state-owned firms, including Argentina's nuclear power company, on the block for possible privatization. . Milei's original pitch late last year to privatize more than 40 state-owned Argentine companies prompted an uproar from the country's powerful Peronist-dominated labor movement.. That was audible ahead of the Senate vote Wednesday in downtown Buenos Aires, as bankers, teachers, truckers and thousands of union members and activists converged around Congress. They chanted: “Our country is not for sale!” . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,"One year later, migrants who cheated death off Greece seek justice and struggle to cope with life",https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/year-migrants-cheated-death-off-greece-seek-justice-111080938,2024-06-13 03:34:15,"A year after one of the worst migrant boat tragedies in the Mediterranean Sea, there are only hazy answers as to why hundreds of lives were lost and who can be held answerable. ATHENS, Greece -- Desperate hands clutched at Ali Elwan's arms, legs and neck, and screams misted his ears, as he spat out saltwater and fought for three hours to keep afloat in the night, dozens of miles from land.. Although a poor swimmer, he lived — one of just 104 survivors from the wreck of a dilapidated old metal fishing boat smuggling up to 750 migrants from North Africa to Europe.. “I was so, so lucky,” the 30-year-old Egyptian told The Associated Press in Athens, Greece, where he works odd jobs while he waits to hear the outcome of his asylum application. “I have two babies. Maybe I stay(ed) in this life for them.”. Thousands have died in Mediterranean Sea shipwrecks in recent years as migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa seek a better life in the affluent European Union.. But the sinking of the Adriana a year ago Friday in international waters 75 kilometers (45 miles) off Pylos in southern Greece was one of the worst. Only 82 bodies were recovered, so that hundreds of families still lack even the grim certitude that their relatives are dead.. Elwan, a cook whose wife and children are in Cairo, says he still gets phone calls from Egypt from mothers, brothers and wives of the missing.. “We (left) home to get best life for family and until now (their families) know nothing about them,” he said.. And after a year there are only hazy answers as to why so many lives were lost, what caused the shipwreck and who can be held answerable.. Migrant charities and human rights groups have strongly criticized Greece's handling of the sinking and its aftermath.. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said Thursday “a credible process for accountability” was needed.. “It is unconscionable that one year since this horrific tragedy, the investigation into the potential liability of (Greece’s) Coast Guard has barely progressed,” HRW official Judith Sunderland said in the groups' joint statement.. The Greek coast guard, migration ministry and other officials did not respond to AP requests for comment ahead of the anniversary.. Authorities had a coast guard boat on the scene and merchant ships in the vicinity during the trawler's last hours. They blame smugglers who crammed hundreds of people into an unseaworthy vessel — most in an airless hold designed to store a catch of fish — for a nightmare voyage from Libya to Italy. . They also say the Adriana capsized when its passengers — some of whom wanted to press on for Italy after five dreadful days at sea, others to seek safety in Greece — suddenly surged to one side, causing it to lurch and turn turtle. And they insist that offers to take the migrants off the ship were rebuffed by people set on reaching Italy.. Elwan — who says he was on deck with a clear view of what happened — and other survivors say the lurching followed a botched coast guard attempt to tow the trawler. He claimed the coast guard hurriedly cut the towline when it became evident the Adriana would sink and drag their boat down with it.. “If you find the ship (at the bottom of the sea), you will find this rope” still attached to it, he said.. But the logistics make such a feat nigh-on impossible, Greek authorities say, as the ship rests some 5 kilometers (more than 3 miles) down, at one of the Mediterranean's deepest points.. The coast guard has denied any towing attempt, and allegations that its vessel tried to shift the trawler into neighboring Italy's area of responsibility.. A naval court began investigating last June, but has released no information on its progress or findings.. Separately, in November Greece's state ombudsman started an independent probe into authorities' handling of the tragedy, bemoaning the coast guard's ""express denial” to initiate a disciplinary investigation.. Last month, a Greek court dropped charges against nine Egyptians accused of crewing the Adriana and causing the shipwreck. Without examining evidence for or against them, it determined that Greece lacked jurisdiction as the wreck occurred in international waters.. Effie Doussi, one of the Egyptians' defense lawyers, argued that the ruling was “politically convenient” for Greek authorities.. “It saved the Greek state from being exposed over how the coast guard acted, given their responsibility for rescue,” she said. . Doussi said a full hearing would have included testimony from survivors and other witnesses, and let defense lawyers seek additional evidence from the coast guard, such as potential mobile phone data.. Zeeshan Sarwar, a 28-year-old Pakistani survivor, said he's still waiting for justice, “but apparently there is nothing.” . “I may be looking fine right now, but I am broken from the inside. We are not getting justice,” he told the AP. “We are not receiving any information about the people of coast guard ... that the court has found them guilty or not.”. Elwan, the Egyptian, said he can still only sleep for three or four hours a night.. “I remember every second that happened to me,” he said. “I can’t forget anything because (I) lost friends in this ship.”. The journey that preceded the wreck was also horrendous.. Survivors said Pakistanis were confined in the hold and beaten by the crew if they tried to stir. But Arabic-speaking Egyptians and Syrians enjoyed the relative luxury of the deck. For many, that spelled the difference between life and death when the ship capsized.. “Our condition was very bad on the first day because it was the first time in our life that we were traveling on the sea,” Sarwar said. . “If a person ... tried to vomit, then they used to say that you have to do it right here on your lap, you can’t get (outside),” he said. “On the fifth day, people were fainting because of hunger and thirst. One man died.”. Elwan said he left for Europe secretly, telling his wife he would be away for months, working at an Egyptian Red Sea resort.. He's upset that he's still to be granted asylum, unlike many Syrian survivors who, he said, have moved on to western Europe.. “Only people from Egypt can't get papers,” he said. “I've been working for 10 months to send money for my family ... If someone says come and move rubbish, I will go and move this rubbish, no problem for me.”. If he gets residence papers, Elwan wants to work in Greece and bring his family over. . Otherwise, “I will go to Italy, maybe Germany. I don't know.”. ___. AP journalist Lefteris Pitarakis contributed to this report.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,G7 summit opens with deal to use Russian assets for Ukraine as EU's traditional powers recalibrate,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/g7-summit-opens-deal-russian-assets-ukraine-eus-111080576,2024-06-13 00:22:27,"A Group of Seven summit is opening in Italy with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral. BARI, Italy -- A Group of Seven summit is opening Thursday with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.. Diplomats confirmed that an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed in southern Italy for the three-day summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.. Beyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He’ll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.. The G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders — Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied — to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.. With Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.. The U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.. A French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen — say if the war ends — then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.. On the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine. . Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy’s first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.. The leaders of the G7’s two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.. As a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.. “While it’s unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially ‘Mediterranean Summit,” said Nick O’Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.. That includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.. Italy, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe’s migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.. Pope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.. He'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers “merchants of death.”. But Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.. The 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.. The G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that’s something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia’s medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.. Located next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.. No such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi’s port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.. As with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a “dinner for the poor” on Friday night calling for “peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.”. ___.

GENEVA -- The head of the U.N. refugee agency says he understands that the Biden administration enacted new restrictions on asylum-seekers entering the United States, but cautioned that some aspects of the executive order may violate refugee protection required in international law.. Filippo Grandi, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, spoke to The Associated Press as his agency issued its annual “Global Trends” report for 2023 on Thursday. It found that the cumulative number of people who have been subjected to forced displacement rose to 120 million people in 2023 — 6 million more than in the year before.. The refugee agency noted that the total count was roughly equivalent to the entire population of Japan. . The UNHCR report found that three-fourths of those people forcibly displaced – including both refugees driven abroad and people displaced inside their own countries – lived in poor or middle-income countries. Grandi insisted that was a sign of how migrant and refugee flows were not just an issue for the rich world.. He lamented how crises in Africa had been largely overlooked, in particular in Sudan, where some 10.8 million were displaced at the end of last year, after conflict erupted between forces loyal to rival generals in April last year.. Grandi said the world’s focus on crises faced by refugees and internally displaced people has largely centered on Gaza -- where a devastating and deadly conflict erupted in October last year -- and Ukraine, which has been saddled by Russia’s invasion since February 2022.. He lamented how the world has largely overlooked the refugee crisis spawned by the conflict in Sudan.. The United States, meanwhile, has faced the “most complex challenge” when it comes to refugees of any country in the developed world, Grandi said — alluding to an influx across the U.S.-Mexican border. . The U.N. refugee agency chief criticized Biden administration plans to enact new restrictions on migrants seeking asylum at the border — seen by some as a political maneuver ahead of national elections in November — as a possible violation of international humanitarian law.. But he acknowledged that Biden administration ambitions to resettle some 125,000 refugees in the United States amounted to “a very shining example of U.S. generosity.”. UNHCR also highlighted difficulties faced by refugees and internally displaced people amid conflict in countries like Congo and Myanmar, and noted that Syria remains the world's largest displacement crisis with nearly 14 million people forcibly displaced both inside the country and abroad. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,AP PHOTOS: Nomadic Muslim devotees throng a forest shrine in disputed Kashmir,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ap-photos-nomadic-muslim-devotees-throng-forest-shrine-111080201,2024-06-12 23:34:18,"BABA NAGRI, India -- The road to the Baba Nagri forest shrine in India-controlled Kashmir was a colorful spectacle. Tens of thousands of men in vibrant attires, henna-dyed beards and bright headgears thronged the Muslim shrine nestled at the base of a mountain to pay their obeisance last week.. Worshippers raised their hands and cried their wishes. Some also tied multicolored threads around the trees at the shrine, which represented their prayers.. The shrine to Mian Nizamuddin Kiyanwi has its origins in the 19th century and provides free meals all year to the devotees, most of them from Kashmir’s nomadic pastoral community. Devotees believe their wishes are granted at the shrine. . Kiyanwi, originally from Kashmir, migrated to the Hazara region of modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan during the late 19th century. There he was mentored by a Sufi saint and later returned to Kashmir to preach Islam. After he died, the shrine was built as a mark of respect towards him — a manifestation of the region’s unique ties with Sufism.. Abdul Razaq, a devotee, said that he has been visiting the shrine since he was 6 and feels blessed by paying obeisance there.. “I remember as a kid we had to travel a lot by foot, but things have changed, and today we can reach the shrine in a day,” he said.. Another devotee, Mohammad Farooq, who is blind, said: “It would have been great if I could see things for myself, but I find peace when I visit the shrine.”. Kashmir, divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both in its entirety, is a Muslim-majority region. . Rebel groups have been fighting since 1989 for Kashmir’s independence, a goal supported by a large number of Muslims in the disputed territory. . The region has remained embroiled in civil strife for decades and the shrine, including hundreds of others strewn around its landscape, has been and continues to be, far more than a mere spiritual retreat for Muslims.. Many worshipers find these shrines a rare space far removed from unrelenting political tensions in the region.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A widespread power outage hit Puerto Rico Wednesday night, leaving more than 340,000 customers without electricity after two of the U.S. territory’s power plants shut down.. The capital of San Juan was left without power, as well as neighboring municipalities including Bayamón, Caguas and Carolina.. Luma Energy, which operates transmission and distribution for Puerto Rico’s power authority, said on X that the outage was tied to an issue with the power plants’ transmission lines. It provided a statement to The Associated Press saying it was investigating the outage that coincided with the shutdown of units operated by Genera PR, which operates and maintains state power generation units.. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi condemned the outage and said he was demanding answers and solutions from Luma and Genera PR.. “The events that have been occurring in recent weeks with our electrical system are unacceptable,” he posted on X. “While it is true that we have old plants and transmission lines in terrible condition, the people continue to suffer the consequences of the lack of sense of urgency that private operators are demonstrating.”. Both Luma and Genera PR were selected as private operators under Pierluisi's administration.. The outage is the most recent in a string of blackouts to hit Puerto Rico, which is still trying to rebuild the grid after Hurricane Maria razed it in 2017 as a Category 4 storm.. The outage prompted the mayor of the San Juan capital, Miguel Romero, to declare a state of emergency late Wednesday as he accused Luma of sharing limited information about the ongoing blackouts.. “There are thousands of children with specific feeding needs, as well as older adults who often need therapy machines to protect their health and often save their lives,” the decree stated.. Scores of Puerto Ricans took to social media to condemn the most recent outage and demand the ouster of Luma, noting that it occurred amid excessive heat warnings.

ISLAMABAD -- One thousand days have passed since girls in Afghanistan were banned from attending secondary schools. That's according to the U.N. children’s agency, which said Thursday that “no country can move forward when half its population is left behind.”. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell in a statement urged Taliban authorities to allow all children to resume learning immediately, and called on the international community to support Afghan girls, who she said need it more than ever. The agency estimates that more than 1 million girls are affected.. The U.N. has warned that the ban on girls’ education remains the Taliban’s biggest obstacle to gaining recognition as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan.. The Taliban, who took over in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces in 2021, has said girls continuing their education goes against the group's strict interpretation of Islamic law.. Despite initially promising a more moderate rule, Taliban have also barred women from higher education, public spaces like parks and most jobs as part of harsh measures imposed. When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan in the 1990s, they also banned girls’ education.. The Taliban has barred girls from attending classes beyond sixth grade, making it the only country in the world with such restrictions on female education.. In March, the new school year started with girls barred from attending classes beyond the sixth grade. Female journalists were not allowed to attend the opening ceremony.. The Taliban also have been prioritizing Islamic knowledge over basic literacy and numeracy with their shift toward madrassas, or religious schools.. UNICEF's executive director called the systematic exclusion of girls “not only a blatant violation of their right to education, but also results in dwindling opportunities and deteriorating mental health.”. She said UNICEF works with partners to run community-based education classes for 600,000 children, two-thirds of them girls, and train teachers.. Although Afghan boys have access to education, Human Rights Watch has said the Taliban's “abusive” educational policies are harming them. In a report published in December, the group said deep harm has been inflicted on boys’ education as qualified teachers — including women — left, including an increase in corporal punishment.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,"China's Premier Li is visiting New Zealand, where security fears vie with trade hopes on the agenda",https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chinas-premier-li-visiting-new-zealand-security-fears-111077559,2024-06-12 23:10:16,"China's Premier Li Qiang has arrived in New Zealand at the start of a weeklong tour that also includes Australia and Malaysia. WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- China’s Premier Li Qiang arrived in New Zealand on Thursday, beginning a rare visit to its closest partner among Western democracies, where a celebration of trade links is expected to vie with concerns about South Pacific security on Wellington's agenda. . China’s No. 2 official, Li is the first Chinese premier to visit New Zealand since a 2017 visit by Li Keqiang. He will also visit Australia and Malaysia, China's Foreign Ministry said this week. The trip coincides with easing tensions between Australia and China that have vexed the relationship in recent years. . New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is expected to salute trade links with China in public statements this week. China is the South Pacific nation's largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth 36 billion New Zealand dollars ($22 billion). They signed a bilateral free trade agreement in 2008 — China's first with an Organization for Cooperation and Development nation — and the visit marks the 10th anniversary of a pledge to bolster ties signed in 2014 when China's President Xi Jinping last visited Wellington.. But while Luxon hailed the visit in remarks to reporters on Monday as presenting renewed opportunities for business, Wellington has long sought to diversify the country's export market away from dependence on China and the visit will not be a simple story of economic success as engagements with New Zealand leaders have sometimes been before. . As China and the U.S. vie for influence in the Pacific, Luxon spoke ahead of a tour of Niue and Fiji this month of “increasingly choppy geostrategic waters” for the region, although he stopped short of naming China except as one of a list of countries jockeying for sway. . New Zealand has in recent years taken a less assertive line with Beijing on security matters than its Western partners in the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership and has sought a consistent foreign policy approach to Beijing that spans political parties and administrations. But Luxon told reporters Monday that there were areas where, in talks with Li, Wellington would “call out our differences and discuss those openly, too.”. One point of friction is likely to be New Zealand's contemplation of joining one tranche of the AUKUS security pact among Australia, the United States and Britain. . “We happen to think AUKUS is good from a security point of view, providing security into the Indo-Pacific,” Luxon said, calling it appropriate that New Zealand explores its options under the agreement before deciding whether to participate.. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi decried New Zealand and Australia's security concerns in meetings with his New Zealand counterpart during a visit to Wellington in March. . “They're real,” Luxon said of regional threats. . On Thursday, more than 100 people held banners and Chinese and New Zealand flags aloft as they lined a side street near the airport in chilly, overcast conditions to watch Li's Air China flight arrive — an unusual sight in the capital, Wellington, population 215,000, which is absent from many international air routes. . The normally sleepy beachside suburb of Lyall Bay had a bolstered presence of law enforcement officers. As Li's motorcade emerged from the airport, drumming, chanting and singing from those assembled greeted the leader, prompting questions from bemused retail workers arriving to open nearby stores. . Li on Saturday will head to Australia's capital, where Beijing's relations in recent years have not been as smooth.. His visit to Canberra caps two years of efforts to rebuild China-Australia relations after a period of intense hostility and celebrates what both sides hope is a sustainable return to normalcy in ties, despite their differences on regional security and human rights..

MEXICO CITY -- Mexican authorities announced Wednesday that they found the remains of some of the 63 miners who were trapped 18 years ago in a coal mine in northern Mexico.. The accident occurred at the Pasta de Conchos mine in the state of Coahuila, which borders Texas, on Feb. 19, 2006. Of the 73 miners on duty, eight survived with serious burns, and two bodies were recovered.. The Interior ministry said Wednesday that after years of searching they were able to locate “the first human remains” in one of the mine’s chambers, but they did not specify when the remains were recovered.. The accident is considered one of the biggest mining tragedies in the country.. It wasn’t until 2020 when President Andrés Manuel López Obrador made a promise to recover the bodies that the process began. Three consecutive governments opted not to try for the rest, saying it would be too dangerous and costly, with no guarantee of success. But victims’ relatives continued to press authorities on the issue over the years.. López Obrador put the Federal Electricity Commission, the nation’s public utility known as the CFE, in charge of the dig – mining and burning coal to reach the long-buried miners.. In the chamber where remains were found there were 13 miners working the day of the accident, according to the Interior ministry.. The government indicated it has not yet determined if an explosion caused the mine's collapse. . The Coahuila state prosecutor's office, in collaboration with the National Search Commission and the National Institute of Genomics Medicine, will begin analyzing the remains for identification and try to determine the cause of the accident.. ___.

abcnews.com,Yemen's Houthi rebels launch boat-borne bomb attack against Greek-owned ship in Red Sea,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-launch-boat-borne-attack-commercial-111069194,2024-06-13 01:02:16,"Yemen’s Houthi rebels have launched a boat-borne bomb attack against a commercial ship in the Red Sea, further escalating their campaign despite a U.S.-led campaign trying to protect the vital waterway. ABOARD THE USS LABOON IN THE RED SEA -- Yemen's Houthi rebels launched a boat-borne bomb attack against a commercial ship in the Red Sea on Wednesday, authorities said, the latest escalation despite a U.S.-led campaign trying to protect the vital waterway. . The use of a boat loaded with explosives raised the specter of 2000's USS Cole attack, a suicide assault by al-Qaida on the warship when it was at port in Aden, killing 17 on board. Associated Press journalists saw the Cole in the Red Sea on Wednesday, now taking part in the U.S. campaign while visiting one of her sister ships, the USS Laboon. . Yemen's military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the attack, identifying the vessel targeted as the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier Tutor. He described the attack as using a “drone boat,” as well as drones and ballistic missiles.. In a warning to shippers, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center described the vessel as being hit in its stern by a small white craft southwest of the Houthi-controlled port city of Hodeida. . The captain “reports the vessel is taking on water, and not under command of the crew,” the UKMTO said. He also “reports the vessel was hit for a second time by an unknown airborne projectile."". The U.S. military's Central Command also acknowledged the attack, saying the Tutor “most recently docked in Russia.” . “The impact of the (drone boat) caused severe flooding and damage to the engine room,” it added.. The U.S. military separately destroyed three anti-ship cruise missile launchers in Houthi-held Yemen, as well as one rebel drone over the Red Sea. The Houthis launched two anti-ship ballistic missiles over the Red Sea, but they caused no damage, Central Command said. . The Houthis, who seized Yemen’s capital nearly a decade ago and have been fighting a Saudi-led coalition since shortly after, have been targeting shipping throughout the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. . They say the attacks are aimed at stopping the war and supporting the Palestinians, though the attacks often target vessels that have nothing to do with the conflict.. The war in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there, while hundreds of others have been killed in Israeli operations in the West Bank. It began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.. The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. A U.S.-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say.. Associated Press journalists on an embark with the U.S. Navy were interviewing Cmdr. Eric Blomberg, the commanding officer of the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer Laboon, when the alert came in on the attack. Blomberg took multiple calls from sailors on board the vessel, giving updates on the apparent attack. . The Laboon is one of the destroyers accompanying the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier and both has shot down Houthi fire and escorted vessels through the region. Though Blomberg and others stressed they were still investigating the attack, he said it appeared the vessel targeted had nothing to do with the Israel-Hamas war. . The Houthis “hit ships that are completely not associated or tied to the U.S. or Israel at all,” Blomberg said. . “These are just innocent merchant sailors carrying goods through the Red Sea, trying to get it through the least-expensive route, and they're paying for it,” he said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,"In initial win for Argentine President Milei, senators approve his key bills after violent protests",https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/argentine-riot-police-disperse-protesters-water-cannons-ahead-111069894,2024-06-13 00:06:28,"Argentina’s Senate narrowly approved key state overhaul and tax packages proposed by President Javier Miliei, delivering an initial legislative victory to the libertarian leader in his efforts to enact his promises of radical change. BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina’s Senate narrowly approved key state overhaul and tax bills proposed by President Javier Miliei, delivering an initial legislative victory to the libertarian leader in his efforts to enact his promises of radical change. . Senators voted 37 to 36 late Wednesday to give their overall approval to the overhaul bill after 11 hours of heated debate while protesters — urging lawmakers to reject Milei's harsh austerity plan — clashed with police outside Congress. The Senators still must approve individual measures in an article-by-article vote set to stretch throughout the night.. In a reflection of the fierce backlash to the legislation and deep polarization gripping Argentina's Congress, Vice President and head of the Senate Victoria Villarruel cast the tiebreaking vote in favor of Milei's agenda. . The legislation delegates broad powers to the president in energy, pensions, security and other areas and includes several measures seen as controversial, including a generous incentive scheme for foreign investors, tax amnesty for those with undeclared assets and plans to privatize some of Argentina's state-owned firms.. If the Senate approves the articles with modifications, the lower house still has to okay them before Milei can claim his first legislative win since entering office last December.. As Senators pored over the bills, protesters in downtown Buenos Aires hurled sticks, stones and Molotov cocktails at police who sprayed water cannons, pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the huge crowds. Demonstrators poured gasoline on two cars and set them alight, turning the central square into a smoke-filled battlefield. Authorities reported least 20 police officers injured and more than a dozen protesters arrested over the violence.. Milei rose to power on promises he would resolve Argentina’s worst economic crisis in two decades. But his political party of relative novices holds just a tiny minority of seats in Congress and he has struggled to strike deals with the opposition.. “We have the weakest president we’ve ever seen who is trying to pass the biggest bill we’ve ever seen,” said Ana Iparraguirre, an Argentina-based analyst at Washington strategy firm GBAO. “That’s the contradiction.”. Senators approved two bills late Wednesday, a tax package and a 238-article state reform bill that passed the lower house of Congress in late April. Months of negotiations watered down the initial far-ranging proposal, which had over 600 articles. . Unlike previous Argentine leaders since the return of democracy in 1983, Milei has failed to pass a single piece of legislation during his first six months in office. Instead, the populist outsider has relied on executive powers to slash state spending and sweep away economic restrictions. . “Today, it’s almost more important for Milei to demonstrate that he can pass laws in Congress than what he passes,” said Lucas Romero, director of Synopsis consultancy.. That desperation was clear in some of the Senators' closing speeches. . “How can I not give a president a tool that he needs in order to function?"" said Luis Juez, senator from the right-wing PRO party, a loose ally of Milei's. “We voted so that this doesn't fail, because if things go badly for Milei, they go badly for everyone.” . Milei's legislation has faced the stiffest pushback from the left-leaning Peronist movement loyal to former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, which has dominated Argentine politics for the last two decades and holds sway over the country’s powerful trade unions. . Bankers, teachers, truckers and thousands of workers from other unions converged around Congress throughout the day, banging drums, blasting trumpets and chanting, “Our country is not for sale!” and “We will defend the state!” . “If this law passes, we are going to lose so many of our labor and pension rights,” said 54-year-old teacher Miriam Rajovitcher protesting ahead of the vote alongside her colleagues, middle-class Argentines who say they’ve had to reconfigure their lives since Milei slashed their school budgets and devalued the currency, driving inflation toward 300%. “I am so much worse off."" . The presidency condemned protesters as “terrorists” and accused them of “attempting to carry out a coup d’état” by disrupting the Congress session.. The Peronist bloc controls 33 out of 72 seats in the Senate while Milei’s party, Freedom Advances, holds just seven seats. The bill needed 37 votes from the 72 total legislators in the Senate to get a majority and ended up producing a 36-36 tie.. Analysts say that foreign investors and the International Monetary Fund, to which Argentina owes a staggering $44 billion, have been closely watching Wednesday’s vote to see whether Milei can build consensus with his opponents.. “Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode. Investors say, 'Yes, we love what you're saying, but we need to see that this is sustainable,” said Marcelo J. García, Americas director at geopolitical risk firm Horizon Engage.. Wednesday’s article-by-article vote will stretch for hours, with analysts expecting lawmakers to further weaken the most divisive sections of the bills. . One of the most contested measures is an incentive program that offers foreign investors lucrative tax breaks for 30 years, no import tariffs on machinery and other perks for big corporations that critics say go too far in neglecting local industry. . “What this law is hurting most are the pockets of workers, not the big companies that are just going to get richer,” said 36-year-old Juan Barreto, a bank employee jostling amid crowds of his fellow union members. . Argentina’s unions have also voiced vehement opposition to measures that would make it easier for companies to fire employees as well as plans to privatize some state-owned firms.. Backlash to the tax bill in particular has centered on an amnesty that would allow Argentines to register undeclared assets at home and abroad without paying hefty taxes, as well as a lower income tax threshold that would force more workers to pay taxes.. Frustrated by legislative resistance, Milei has increasingly moderated his previous all-or-nothing approach. Earlier this month, in a bid to break the impasse, Milei fired his inexperienced Cabinet chief and replaced him with Interior Minister Guillermo Francos, a career politician skilled at congressional wheeling and dealing.. Over the past month, political tensions have mounted, casting doubt over Milei's governability and injecting uncertainty into the Argentine economy. . Sovereign bonds have tumbled. The country’s currency, the peso, has depreciated as well, widening the gap between the official and black market exchange rate to nearly 40%. The peso was trading at 1,255 per greenback on the informal market Wednesday, a rate far lower than earlier this year. . Even as the IMF has praised the libertarian's agenda and released tranches of frozen loans, the fund has held back from handing Argentina fresh cash that Milei says he needs to lift currency controls.. Meanwhile, Milei has been in Silicon Valley rubbing shoulders with billionaire tech executives Elon Musk, Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg. The meetings however, have not produced any announcements of substantial investments.. “What you’re seeing in the last three weeks is the market and investors getting a little nervous,” said García. “The market is saying, ‘Show me that you can govern.’”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

ABUJA, Nigeria -- Traces of highly potent opioids known as nitazenes have for the first time been found to be consumed by people who use drugs in Africa, according to a report released Wednesday by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, a nonprofit organization.. Nitazenes, powerful synthetic opioids, have long been in use in Western countries as well as in Asia where they have been associated with overdose deaths. Some of them can be up to 100 times more potent than heroin and up to 10 times more potent than fentanyl, meaning that users can get an effect from a much smaller amount, putting them at increased risk of overdose and death. . The report focused on Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau and is based on chemical testing of kush, a derivative of cannabis mixed with synthetic drugs like fentanyl and tramadol and chemicals like formaldehyde. Researchers found that in Sierra Leone, 83% of the samples were found to contain nitazenes, while in Guinea-Bissau it was identified in 55%. . “The GI-TOC ( Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime) believes that these results are the first indication that nitazenes have penetrated retail drug markets in Africa,” the report said.. Many young people in West and Central Africa have become addicted to drugs with between 5.2% and 13.5% using cannabis, the most widely used illicit substance on the continent, according to the World Health Organization.. In Sierra Leone where kush is one of the most widely consumed drugs, President Julius Maada Bio this year declared war on the substance, calling it an epidemic and a national threat.. Nitazenes have been detected repeatedly in substances sold to young people in the region such that users are most likely ingesting them ""without knowing the risks they face,” Wednesday's report said.. The authors said their findings suggest that nitazenes are being imported into Sierra Leone from elsewhere and that the substance being sold as kush in Guinea-Bissau was of similar chemical composition to that found in Freetown.. Officials in the two countries must deploy chemical testing equipment as a first step in tackling drug abuse, the report said. “Without this, it is impossible for the government of Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and the wider subregion to accurately monitor the countries’ illicit drug markets and develop evidence-based responses,” it said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,The University of Cambridge returns 39 traditional artifacts to Uganda in a major act of restitution,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/university-cambridge-returns-39-traditional-artifacts-uganda-major-111066606,2024-06-12 23:50:26,"The University of Cambridge has repatriated more than three dozen traditional artifacts to Uganda in a major act of restitution welcomed by the local officials who sought them. KAMPALA, Uganda -- The University of Cambridge has repatriated more than three dozen traditional artifacts to Uganda in a major act of restitution welcomed by the local officials who sought them.. Some of the objects were shown exclusively to AP journalists on Wednesday. The British university returned the 39 items, which range from tribal regalia to delicate pottery, to the East African country on Saturday.. The items remain the property of the collection of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge, which is loaning them to Uganda for an initial period of three years, said Mark Elliott, the museum's senior curator in anthropology.. Elliott described it as ""very much a museum-to-museum collaboration"" that stems from years of talks about the possibility of returning objects deemed “exceptionally powerful and exceptionally sensitive to communities whose belongings they were.”. The objects, selected by Ugandan curators, represent a small fraction of about 1,500 ethnographic objects from Uganda that Cambridge has owned for a century. Cambridge acquired most as donations from private collections, and many were given by an Anglican missionary active in Uganda in the 1890s and early 20th century.. Uganda was declared a British protectorate in 1894. Independence came in 1962.. ""It's about putting these objects back in the hands of the Ugandan people,"" Elliott said. “These objects have been away from home for so long."". The next step is to “research their contemporary significance and to help make decisions about their future,” he said.. The Uganda Museum in the capital, Kampala, is expected to put on a temporary exhibition of the objects next year.. Uganda’s agreement with Cambridge is renewable, allowing for the possibility of a permanent loan and perhaps local ownership, said Jackline Nyiracyiza, Ugandan government commissioner in charge of museums and monuments.. “Sixty years that have passed for us now to get 39 objects,” she said. “We are working now with the Cambridge team to ... see that we talk to other museums and be able to repatriate others maybe next year or within the near future.”. Ugandan officials, seeking such restitution, first traveled to Cambridge in 2022 as more African governments started to demand accountability over items of aesthetic or cultural value that were looted before and during the colonial era.. Elsewhere in Africa, including the West African nation of Nigeria, there have been successful restitution events in recent years.. Nelson Abiti, principal curator of the Uganda Museum, spoke of the Cambridge deal as a breakthrough that could prove exemplary for other museums with ethnographic items from Uganda.. “This is the biggest single movement of objects returned to the African continent” in recent years, Abiti asserted.. Still, restitution remains a struggle for African governments, and the African Union has put the return of looted cultural property on its agenda. The continental body aims to have a common policy on the issue.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Wednesday the suspension of controversial voting reforms in New Caledonia, following a spate of deadly unrest in the French Pacific territory. . The reforms, which would have altered voting rights, are feared by the Indigenous Kanak people who say they would have marginalize them further. The issue has caused the worst violence on the archipelago in decades.. The violence flared on May 13 in response to attempts by Macron’s government to amend the French Constitution and change voting lists in New Caledonia. France declared a state of emergency in its Pacific territory on May 15 and rushed hundreds of troop reinforcements to help police quell the revolt that included shootings, clashes, looting and arson.. Both sides of New Caledonia’s bitter divide — Indigenous Kanaks, who want independence and those loyal to France — erected barricades, either to revolt against authorities or to protect their homes and properties. Pro-independence protesters built up barricades of charred vehicles and other debris, turning parts of the capital, Noumea, into no-go zones.. “The constitutional bill regarding New Caledonia... I have decided to suspend,” Macron said. “We cannot leave ambiguity during this period. It must be suspended to give full strength to dialogue on the ground and the return to order.”. The French Justice Ministry on Wednesday confirmed the death of a 34-year-old man on June 11, who had been injured during a confrontation with police on May 29. An autopsy has been ordered and an investigation into the use of force by the gendarme involved is underway.. Louis Mapou, president of New Caledonia’s government, expressed his condolences and called for calm. “I urge the immediate removal of barricades and a return to peace,” Mapou said..

CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The leader of South Africa's Inkatha Freedom Party said Wednesday it will join a proposed government of national unity, a step toward ending the country's political deadlock after the long-ruling African National Congress lost its parliamentary majority in last month's election.. The announcement by Velenkosini Hlabisa means an agreement between some major parties to form a coalition government with the ANC becomes more likely ahead of a Friday deadline, when South Africa's new Parliament will sit for the first time since the May 29 election and attempt to elect a president.. The ANC had been the governing party for 30 years since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994, but only received 40% of the vote in this election. It remains the biggest party but needs to form an agreement with others to govern and reelect President Cyril Ramaphosa for a second and final term.. South Africans vote for parties in national elections and they get seats in Parliament according to their share of the vote. Lawmakers then elect the president of Africa's most industrialized country.. The ANC proposed forming a government of national unity last week instead of a narrower coalition with one or two parties and invited all 17 other parties represented in Parliament to be part of it. Some have refused.. Hlabisa told reporters that the IFP was willing to join a unity government that includes the ANC and the Democratic Alliance, South Africa's main opposition party that received the second largest share of the vote.. The IFP will do it ""for the sake of our country and a stable government,” Hlabisa said. The party draws most of its support from the Zulu ethnic group.. The centrist Democratic Alliance has indicated it would also be willing to join a unity government but hasn't made a final announcement while it holds talks with the ANC over the details.. The ANC, DA and IFP would together hold a clear majority of seats.. Two other major parties, the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters and the new MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma, have refused to join the unity agreement. MK has filed court papers to halt the first meeting of Parliament and has objected to the results of the election, claiming there were irregularities.. South Africa's independent electoral commission conceded there were logistical problems and noted objections by several parties, but officially announced the results on June 2 and said the election was free and fair. Independent observers also declared it free and fair.. MK said its 58 new lawmakers would not attend Parliament if it goes ahead on Friday. However, even if MK boycotts, South Africa’s constitution says only a third out of Parliament's 400 lawmakers need to be present for a quorum and the vote to elect the president would proceed.. ___.

ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland -- The wreck of the last ship belonging to Sir Ernest Shackleton, a famous Irish-born British explorer of Antarctica, has been found off the coast of Labrador in Canada, 62 years after it went missing. The wreck was found by an international team led by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.. The Quest was found using sonar scans on Sunday evening, sitting on its keel under 390 meters (1,280 feet) of churning, frigid water, the society said. Its towering mast is lying broken beside it, likely cracked off as the vessel was sucked into the depths after it struck ice on May 5, 1962.. “I heard that some Americans were interested in finding Quest, and I just had this picture in my mind of a few billionaires on yachts, up in the Labrador Sea,” John Geiger, leader of the Shackleton Quest Expedition and the chief executive of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, told an audience at the Memorial University’s Marine Institute in St. John’s, Newfoundland, on Wednesday.. “We’ve done it the right way. It’s not about anyone’s ego, it’s about telling great stories and celebrating some of the finest human attributes,” Geiger said.. He called the Quest a historically very important ship. . Shackleton’s death aboard the ship in 1922 marked the end of what historians consider the “heroic age” of Antarctic exploration. The explorer led three British expeditions to the Antarctic, and he was in the early stages of a fourth when he died of a heart attack. He was 47.. The Norwegian-built Quest was a schooner-rigged steamship, and Shackleton bought it specifically to travel to Canada’s High Arctic, Geiger said. But the Canadian government at the time axed those plans, and Shackleton decided to set sail once again for the Antarctic.. He died when it was just off South Georgia, east of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. . After the explorer’s death, the Quest was used for Arctic research and then returned to its original intended use as a sealing vessel. It sank in 1962, after it was damaged by ice in the Labrador Sea while on a whaling trip.. The vessel appears to be in “incredible condition,” though it was damaged when it slammed into the seabed, Geiger said.. It won’t be brought to the surface — that would be far too expensive, he added — but it will be thoroughly documented and studied. A crew will likely head out some time before the end of summer to begin taking footage of the vessel with a remotely operated vehicle.. In 2022, researchers discovered another one of Shackleton’s ships, the Endurance in 10,000 feet — about 3,000 meters — of icy water, a century after it was swallowed up by Antarctic ice. . A team of marine archaeologists, engineers and other scientists used an icebreaker ship and underwater drones to locate the wreck at the bottom of the Weddell Sea, near the Antarctica Peninsula.. The expedition Endurance22 embarked from Cape Town, South Africa, in early February in a ship capable of breaking through 3-foot (1-meter)-thick ice.. The team, which included more than 100 researchers and crew members, deployed underwater drones that combed the seafloor for two weeks in the area where the ship was recorded to have sunk in 1915.. Shackleton never achieved his ambition to become the first person to cross Antarctica via the South Pole. In fact, he never set foot on the continent during the failed Endurance expedition, though he did visit Antarctica during earlier voyages.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan’s new coalition government presented its first budget in parliament on Wednesday, promising an increase of up to 25% in the salaries of government employees and setting an ambitious tax collection target while talks with the International Monetary Fund about a new bailout continue.. Analysts say the new budget of about $68 billion — up from $50 billion last fiscal year — is aimed at qualifying for a long-term loan of $6 billion to $8 billion from the IMF to help stabilize the economy, which in 2023 nearly defaulted on the payment of foreign debts.. Pakistan’s fiscal year begins on July 1. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wants to achieve 3.6% economic growth.. Aurangzeb also said inflation in Pakistan is down to 12%. At one point last year, it went above 40%, sparking angry protests.. ""Now we are moving towards the right direction,” Aurangzeb said.. The minister announced that Pakistan is setting a challenging target of collecting 13 trillion rupees ($44 billion) in taxes, which is 40% more than in the current fiscal year. He said the government will ensure that the number of taxpayers increases.. Currently, about 5 million of Pakistan's 240 million people pay taxes.. On the IMF talks, Aurangzeb said Pakistan will privatize the country's national carrier. Pakistan International Airlines has had losses and has deteriorated over the decades as governments doled out patronage by giving airline jobs to supporters.. Aurangzeb also said the government will encourage the private sector to manufacture solar panels and other equipment in Pakistan, where tens of thousands of people have already installed Chinese-made solar system at homes, shops, schools, hospitals and factories because of increasing electricity rates.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

TALLINN, Estonia -- Thousands of athletes in both major and obscure sports will be vying for medals in the Russian city of Kazan at the sixth BRICS Games, an international competition shadowed by politics amid Russia's exclusion from major sports events.. The games opened Wednesday, which Russia observes as its independence day holiday, underlining the key role that sports plays in its national identity.. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has been frozen out of the most prominent international competitions and sports associations; some Russian passport holders will be allowed to compete as neutral athletes in the Paris Olympics that begin July 26, but their results will not be credited to Russia. . In that atmosphere, the BRICS Games are a way for Russia to underline its aggrieved claims of prejudice and inequitable treatment by the West and international sports organizations.. “Our country has always adhered to the principle that sport is beyond politics, but we are constantly drawn into the politics, because they understand the importance of sport in the lives of our Russian people,"" Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko, the top government official overseeing the games, said in May.. Oleg Matytsin, who was Russia's sports minister until mid-May, said while organizing the games that they were not intended as a substitute for the Olympics. “We consider that the Olympic Games have no alternative.” he said. . But even the games' name carries a strong alternative connotation. BRICS — short for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — has evolved from a group promoting investments into a geopolitical bloc positioning itself as a counterweight to North America and the European Union. It now also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.. The games have been held each year since 2017 in the country that has the rotating chairmanship of BRICS and have varied widely in the number of the sports included. The first competition was held in China and involved only volleyball, wushu and taolu.. Wushu, also known as kung fu, is the Chinese term for “martial arts.” It has had a presence in the Asian Games since 1990. Taolu involves performing sets and choreographed routines that show off principles of attack and defense.. The Kazan iteration is by far the largest and most varied, with medals in 27 sports. The events range from the familiar — including tennis, wrestling and weightlifting — to niche and nascent sports.. There will be competitions in two “phygital” sports — soccer and basketball — that combine physical matchups along with play on video screens. A discipline called “acrobatic rock ‘n’ roll” also is included, as are belt wrestling and Koresh belt wrestling. . Organizers say they expect about 4,000 participants at the games that run through June 23, but the number of countries represented is elusive. The games' website says only that more than 60 countries were invited, but lists 91 on its medals table. Chernyshenko said entries have been received from 97 countries.. Two of those listed are considered to be actual countries by almost no one — Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgian regions that came under Russian control in a 2008 war and that Moscow later recognized as independent. The participants list also includes Republika Srpska, a constituent state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a separate entry.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Denmark recalls spicy South Korean noodles over health concerns,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/denmark-recalls-3-spicy-instant-noodle-soup-brands-111058764,2024-06-13 03:34:17,"Food authorities in Denmark have recalled three types of spicy instant noodle products imported from South Korea over possible risks for “acute poisoning.”. COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Food authorities in Denmark have recalled three types of spicy instant noodle products imported from South Korea over possible risks for “acute poisoning.” Consumers are asked to discard them or return the noodles to the retailer.. The noodles are made by Seoul-based Samyang Foods, one of South Korea’s largest companies, and sold across the globe. The recalled noodles include Buldak Samyang 3 x Spicy & Hot Chicken, Buldak Samyang 2 x Spicy & Hot Chicken and Buldak Samyang Hot Chicken Stew. . The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said the products contain an overly high dose of capsaicin, an active ingredient in chile peppers but also a chemical that can be a neurotoxin and a health hazard.. Children and teenagers in Denmark have been daring each other on social media to eat “a strong bowl of noodle soup,” referring to the three South Korean products, the agency said. . “The noodle dishes marketed as extremely strong must no longer be sold because consumers and especially children risk acute poisoning,” it said late Tuesday. ""The capsaicin content is so high that it can pose a health hazard.”. Children and frail adults and the elderly are at risk, said Henrik Dammand Nielsen of the Danish Food and Drug Administration. Possibly symptoms include burning and discomfort, nausea, vomiting and high blood pressure, he said.. “That is why we are now demanding shops remove the products from their shelves,” the agency said.. In a statement to reporters, Samyang said it understands that the steps taken in Denmark were not based on product quality issues but because local authorities thought “they were too spicy and could potentially cause problems.”. The company said the same noodles are exported worldwide but it was the first time they were ordered to recall them in any market.. “We will closely study local regulations while responding to this recall measure,” the company said.. Spicy food challenges have been around for years. From local chile pepper eating contests to restaurant walls of fame for those who finished extra hot dishes, people around the world have been daring each other to eat especially fiery foods.. In September, a Massachusetts teen with a congenital heart defect who participated in a spicy tortilla chip challenge on social media died from eating a large quantity of chile pepper extract. An autopsy report obtained by The Associated Press showed that the 10th grader died on Sept. 1, 2023, after eating the Paqui chip as part of the manufacturer’s “One Chip Challenge.” . In Denmark, a puzzled consumer reached out to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration and asked how the instant noodles could be legal, the agency said, after which it had a lab assessing the products and determined the three noodle brands can be harmful to health, instigating the recall.. ""It is important that parents are aware of the extreme noodle varieties and avoid them, Dammand Nielsen said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,What are the main sticking points in the cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas?,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/main-sticking-points-cease-fire-talks-israel-hamas-111057752,2024-06-12 12:30:14,"The latest proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza has the support of the United States and most of the international community, but Hamas has not fully embraced it, and neither, it seems, has Israel. The latest proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza has the support of the United States and most of the international community, but Hamas has not fully embraced it, and neither, it seems, has Israel.. Hamas this week accepted the broad outline but requested “amendments."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly disputed aspects of the plan, raising questions about Israel's commitment to what the U.S. says is an Israeli proposal.. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is on his eighth visit to the region since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war, told reporters in Qatar on Wednesday that the negotiations will continue.. But he said Hamas had requested “numerous” changes, adding that “ some of the changes are workable; some are not.” . Blinken declined to elaborate, but recent statements by Israeli and Hamas officials suggest they remain divided over many of the same issues that mediators have been trying to bridge for months.. Here's a look at the main sticking points.. Hamas has insisted it will not release the remaining hostages unless there's a permanent cease-fire and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. When President Joe Biden announced the latest proposal last month, he said it included both.. But Netanyahu says Israel is still committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities, and ensuring it can never again carry out an Oct. 7-style assault. A full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, where Hamas' top leadership and much of its forces are still intact, would almost certainly leave the group in control of the territory and able to rearm.. That's in part because Israel has yet to put forward a plan for Gaza's postwar governance, and has rejected a U.S. proposal that has wide regional support because it would require major progress toward creating a Palestinian state.. Hamas spokesman Jihad Taha told a Lebanese news outlet on Wednesday that the “amendments” requested by the group aim to guarantee a permanent cease-fire and a complete Israeli withdrawal.. Hamas is also seeking the release of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, including political leaders and senior militants convicted of orchestrating deadly attacks on Israeli civilians. But it's unclear if the sides have agreed on a list of who will be freed, or on whether they will be released in Gaza, the occupied West Bank or sent into exile.. The cease-fire plan calls for an initial six-week phase in which Hamas would release some hostages — including women, older adults and wounded people — in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from populated areas. Palestinian civilians would be able to return to their homes and humanitarian aid would be ramped up.. But then things get tricky.. The two sides are supposed to use that six-week period to negotiate an agreement on the second phase, which Biden said would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israel's full withdrawal from Gaza. The temporary cease-fire would become permanent.. But only if the two sides agree on the details.. Hamas appears concerned that Israel will resume the war once its most vulnerable hostages are returned. And even if it doesn't, Israel could make demands in that stage of negotiations that were not part of the initial deal and are unacceptable to Hamas — and then resume the war when Hamas refuses them.. Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan, said Israel would demand in those negotiations that Hamas be removed from power. “We cannot agree to Hamas continuing to be the rulers of Gaza because then Gaza will continue to pose a threat to Israel,"" Erdan told CNN’s “The Source” on Monday.. Israel also appears wary of the plan's provision that the initial cease-fire be extended as long as negotiations continue over the second phase. Erdan said that would allow Hamas to “continue with endless and meaningless negotiations.”. There are other issues that could unravel cease-fire efforts, beginning with the utter lack of trust between Israel and Hamas, which have fought five wars and are committed to each other's destruction.. Then there are the intense and contrasting pressures on Netanyahu, which may explain his mixed signals about the proposal.. Thousands of Israelis, including families of the hostages, have protested in recent months to demand the government bring the captives home, even at the expense of a lopsided deal with Hamas.. But the far-right partners in Netanyahu's increasingly narrow coalition have rejected the U.S.-backed plan and have threatened to bring down his government if he ends the war without destroying Hamas.. They want to reoccupy Gaza, encourage the “voluntary emigration” of Palestinians from the territory and rebuild Jewish settlements there. Netanyahu's ultranationalist allies have more leverage over him than at any time since the start of the war after Benny Gantz, a centrist political opponent, resigned Sunday from Israel's war Cabinet. . It's hard to imagine either Israel or Hamas entirely giving up on the talks. For Israel, that would likely mean abandoning scores of hostages still held in Gaza. For Hamas, it would prolong the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and give Israel more time to annihilate the militants. . But Blinken hinted that the negotiations would not continue indefinitely.. “At some point in a negotiation, and this has gone back and forth for a long time, you get to a point where if one side continues to change its demands, including making demands and insisting on changes for things that it already accepted, you have to question whether they’re proceeding in good faith or not.”. ___.

abcnews.com,Germany proposes a new law to fast-track young men to join its depleted armed forces,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/germanys-government-proposes-new-law-fast-track-young-111057090,2024-06-12 11:55:19,"Germany’s defense minister is proposing legislation that would help refill the depleted ranks of the armed forces to bolster the country's defense capabilities. BERLIN -- Germany's defense minister announced on Wednesday plans for new legislation that would help refill the depleted ranks of the armed forces to bolster the country's defense capabilities. . Boris Pistorius said the proposed bill would allow the government to send letters to all young men who turn 18 — about 400,000 every year — asking about their willingness and ability to serve in the military. . Under the law, those who receive the letter would have to fill out the questions. The army would then invite those interested in serving for a medical checkup and choose the most qualified to serve in the military for a period of 6-23 months. . Speaking to reporters in Berlin, Pistorius explained that the threat levels have changed from what they were a few years ago. . “Russia has now been waging a war against Ukraine for two and a half years — it is not only calling the rules-based international order into question, it is destroying it,"" he said. “This is a new threat situation.”. The campaign is part of efforts to boost active forces numbers to 203,000 from the current just under 181,000 figure. Germany had over 500,000 troops during the Cold War.. If the bill passes, the new military service would still be voluntary and a far cry from compulsory conscription for young men, which was suspended in Germany in 2011, after 55 years. Since then, there has been no mandatory military and civilian service in the country.. Germany’s conscription act still stipulates that compulsory military service for men can be revived if the parliament declares a state of emergency for defense. . Women who turn 18 would also receive the letters, Pistorius said, but would not be obliged to answer, since Germany's constitution does not foresee mandatory service for them.. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, leading to one of most brutal wars in Europe since World War II, calls have steadily grown in Germany to reintroduce some kind of military service to be better prepared for possible future wars.. Only days after Russia attacked Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged to increase Germany’s defense spending to a NATO target of 2% of gross domestic product and set up the 100 billion-euro ($107 billion) special fund. He said that the invasion marked a “turning point.”. Pistorius himself has repeatedly said that Germany must become “fit for war” in order to be able to act as a credible deterrent together with its NATO allies.. If the proposal becomes law, Pistorius expects that of the about 400,000 young men who fill out the questionnaire each year, around a quarter would express an interest in serving in the military. Of those, the army is likely to choose 5,000 most qualified men but hopes to increase that number in the long-term. . Germany's lack of military personnel and equipment is a known problem. In March, the parliament's commissioner for the armed forces said in her annual report that Germany’s military still has “too little of everything.”. “The Bundeswehr is aging and shrinking,” Eva Hoegl said and acknowledged at the time that “the issue of personnel has very clearly arrived on the political agenda.”. In the face of perceived growing threats by Russia, other European countries are also considering new forms of military service.. In Britain, the governing Conservative Party said in May that all 18-year-olds in the country would have to perform a year of mandatory military or civilian national service if it wins the July 4 national election.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Republican candidates for Utah's open US House seat split on aid for Ukraine,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/republican-candidates-utahs-open-us-house-seat-split-111081124,2024-06-13 01:10:18,"The five Republicans battling for Utah’s only open U.S. House seat have agreed in a debate that they see an urgent need to reduce federal spending. SALT LAKE CITY -- All five Republicans battling for Utah's only open U.S. House seat agreed in a debate Wednesday that they see an urgent need to reduce federal spending, but only some said cutting military aid to Ukraine would be an effective way to achieve that goal.. The crowded pool of candidates is vying to represent Utah's sweeping 3rd District, which spans the entire eastern border of the state and groups vastly different communities, from the winter resort town of Park City, to the urban center of Provo, down to the red rock recreation hub of Moab. . At the April GOP convention, state Sen. Mike Kennedy earned the official party nod for the seat U.S. Rep. John Curtis is vacating to run for U.S. Senate. But in a district that represents such a wide range of viewpoints and walks of life, Kennedy's endorsement from delegates, who tend to lean farther right than Republican voters, may not be enough to carry him through the June 25 primary. . He was joined on the debate stage Wednesday by four candidates who had already guaranteed their spots on the primary ballot before the convention by gathering signatures. . The winner of the Republican primary will face Democratic nominee Glenn Wright, a former Summit County councilmember, in November. The GOP candidate is strongly favored to win in a district that has not been represented by a Democrat since 1997.. Among the Republican contenders is Stewart Peay, an attorney and former U.S. Army captain from Alpine who is endorsed by his wife's uncle, retiring U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney. While Peay said previously that Romney's endorsement was a game changer for his campaign, he presented himself Wednesday as more conservative-leaning than his famously moderate family member. . State Auditor John Dougall similarly leaned in to conservative talking points despite having built a social media strategy around his criticism of certain Republican-backed legislation.. A series of skits shows Dougall reading a newspaper on the toilet and emerging from a bathroom stall to air his frustrations about being the state official tasked with enforcing a ban on transgender people using public restrooms or changing rooms inconsistent with their birth sex. He calls the state Legislature an “invasive and overly aggressive” body that he says too often fails to seek input from those most affected by policy.. Dougall's “bathroom monitor” character has boosted his name recognition significantly and has caught the attention of many moderate voters eager to back someone willing to challenge GOP hardliners. But Dougall refrained from taking any jabs at his party during the debate, instead touting his anti-abortion views and years of auditing experience that he said will help him reduce federal spending. . Cutting military aid to Ukraine as it continues to fend off a Russian invasion is not the way to do that, he said. . Peay agreed and urged Congress to keep sending weapons and ammunition to help the Ukrainian military. He and Case Lawrence, founder of a nationwide empire of indoor trampoline parks, stressed that withdrawing U.S. support would demonstrate weakness on the world stage. . “I don't believe in foreign aid. I believe in foreign investment, investment in American interests,” Lawrence said. “Future aid to Ukraine will be based on facts on the ground and how those affect American interests.”. Kennedy and JR Bird, mayor of the northeast Utah town of Roosevelt, said that while it pains them to see Ukraine devastated by war, it is not in the best interest of U.S. officials to continue funding their fight. . Republicans in Congress have been similarly split on whether to keep sending urgently needed weaponry to Ukraine. The Ukrainian military endured major setbacks during a monthslong funding impasse on Capitol Hill and has since burned through foreign aid faster than expected.. Bird, who promoted himself as the only candidate from a rural part of the district, said the U.S. needs to shift focus from military funding to hitting Russia with stronger sanctions. He criticized President Joe Biden's administration for what he sees as throwing money at the problem when there are more strategic ways for the U.S. to assert its influence. . Kennedy agreed, adding that he would urge the U.S. to seize Russian assets and “make them pay for the mess that they've created for us.”. “We cannot be the police officer of the whole world,” Kennedy said. “We don't have the money to do all this. Our grandchildren don't deserve us to rack up more national debt to support international wars that are not directly in our national security interest.”. Wednesday concluded a marathon week of Republican primary debates in Utah. Challengers for two of Utah’s four congressional seats faced off Monday, followed by the four Republicans battling for Romney's open U.S. Senate seat. Candidates for governor and the open attorney general position debated Tuesday.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Hollywood's A-listers are lining up behind Joe Biden. Will their support matter in November?,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/hollywoods-listers-lining-joe-biden-support-matter-november-111081126,2024-06-13 01:18:16,"Celebrities are increasingly lending their star power to President Joe Biden, hoping to energize their fans to vote for him in November and entice donors to pony up for his campaign. WASHINGTON -- When Robert De Niro showed up outside a Manhattan courthouse to decry Donald Trump as his New York hush money trial was winding down, it sparked a life-imitates-art screaming match with a nearby group of the former president's supporters.. “You are gangsters!” De Niro, who starred in “Goodfellas” and won an Oscar for “The Godfather Part II,"" shouted at the Trump backers, who responded with obscenities.. There are plenty more Hollywood storylines still to come in the 2024 campaign: Celebrities are increasingly lending their star power to President Joe Biden, hoping to energize their fans to vote for him in November and to entice donors to pony up for his reelection effort.. On Saturday, A-listers George Clooney and Julia Roberts will team up with former President Barack Obama at a Biden fundraiser in Los Angeles, where the three will be interviewed by late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. Roberts and Kimmel have already begun soliciting donations via text for Biden, who is skipping a weekend peace conference on Ukraine being held in Switzerland to attend the event. . Director Steven Spielberg is involved in storytelling efforts for the Democratic National Convention in August. Lenny Kravitz, Barbra Streisand and James Taylor have all performed for Biden donors.. Others who've sent fundraising emails, organized events or otherwise lent their support include Connie Britton of “The White Lotus” fame, singer-songwriter Carole King, “Bridgerton” creator Shonda Rhimes, singer Christina Aguilera, “The Equalizer” actress Queen Latifah and “Star Wars” actor Mark Hamill, who turned up in the White House briefing room last month to personally praise the president.. And, in another instance blurring lines between real life and make-believe, during a fundraiser at the home of veteran actor Michael Douglas, Biden, the actual president, congratulated the star of the 1996 hit “The American President” on his fictional administration's success. . For all the celebrity supporters, though, there's little expectation they can determine votes. Rather, they are seen as having the ability to inject excitement that helps energize supporters.. Lexi Underwood, whose credits include the streaming series “Little Fires Everywhere,” calls acting a “contact sport” that allows her to interact with the public and makes her determined to use her influence responsibly. She has participated in a recent virtual ”Students for Biden” event and traveled to Nevada to appear at campaign events focused on women's health issues.. “I’m very fortunate to have certain eyes on me,"" said Underwood, 20. ""I feel really responsible to make sure that what I put out there, either people are being informed on things that they weren’t previously informed on, or that I’m motivating them to get out there and vote.”. Biden's campaign says its chief focus is finding authentic and trusted messengers who can promote the president's policy achievements and raise the alarm about GOP “extremism,"" and that means deploying everyday supporters as well as famous ones. It has produced ads featuring a Pennsylvania union worker, a Black entrepreneur in Detroit and women adversely affected by strict abortion limits in Texas.. Fai Nelson, a human resources worker who attended a recent Vice President Kamala Harris event in Prince George's County, Maryland, said celebrity voices can make a difference “if they can touch the audience.” . “It’s whether the message is relevant,"" said Nelson, 42.. During the pandemic-era campaign of 2020, Biden's campaign featured celebrities in scores of virtual events that showed the importance of staying flexible so that stars can present themselves in the most authentic ways. . Adrienne Elrod, who served as Biden’s 2020 director of surrogate strategy and operations, said famous Biden supporters often “will come forward with their own ideas” on how to help the campaign and what issues they'd like to focus on. . “We’ll oftentimes have ideas for them as well,"" she said. “That’s why there’s always a very productive working relationship when we’re engaging these folks.”. De Niro has taken on an increasingly prominent role in Biden's campaign. Before his confrontation with the Trump supporters, the actor held a press conference calling the former president a “clown."" He's also attended Biden fundraisers and narrated a campaign ad accusing Trump of having “snapped” after he lost the 2020 election. . Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the former president's campaign, said, “The only people in America who support Joe Biden’s failing campaign are elitist Hollywood celebrities,"" adding that Trump “speaks for the forgotten men and women of this country.”. Trump has his own list of celebrity endorsers, which includes musicians Kid Rock and Ted Nugent, UFC CEO Dana White, media personality Caitlyn Jenner and actors Dennis Quaid and Jon Voight, as well as comedian Roseanne Barr.. Elrod said other stars are anxious to follow De Niro's lead for Biden but are waiting ""until the moment can truly be maximized"" before they get involved. She pointed to 2020, when Bruce Springsteen narrated a Biden ad featuring his song “My Hometown” just before the election.. ""I think you’ll see more moments like this, when we’re using those voices strategically and effectively at the time that makes the most sense for us on the campaign,” said Elrod, who is a Biden campaign spokesperson this cycle.. David Schmid, an English professor at the University of Buffalo who studies popular culture, said celebrities can influence fans' aspirations and what they consume. But their influence “over peoples’ voting habits has been really exaggerated,"" he said. . That's the case for Alex Dillion, a rising sophomore at American University in Washington who also attended the Harris event in Maryland. Asked which famous person might influence him politically, Dillion offered, “Maybe Obama.”. Schmid said one celebrity with outsized political influence might be Taylor Swift, who sent shockwaves even through the NFL last season. She endorsed Biden in 2020 and is being openly courted by the campaign this time on social media, and even in a press release that saluted her latest album.. Her touch isn't a guarantee of victory, though. In 2018, Swift endorsed two Democratic candidates in Tennessee who lost. And Schmid said that even someone as famous as Swift “knows things are polarizing and they don't want to take major risks” on candidates and contentious issues.. For all the Biden team's work with celebrities, the president still tries to cultivate the image of someone in tune with ordinary people.. During a campaign swing through Saginaw, Michigan, the president visited a public golf course and met with community activist Coleman Hurley III and his son.. “The celebrities that have everything they want and they need, they may possibly be out of touch,"" the older Hurley said later in a phone interview.. As for ordinary Americans, Hurley added, Biden needs to be able to ""relate and see where they live ... and then have a conversation about some of the different struggles or issues that we, or other Americans, face.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,"Trump is returning to Capitol Hill to meet with Republican lawmakers, a first since Jan. 6 attack",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-returning-capitol-hill-meet-republican-lawmakers-jan-111080944,2024-06-13 00:54:17,"Donald Trump is making a triumphant return to Capitol Hill to meet with House and Senate Republicans for the first time since the Jan. 6, 2021 attack. WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump is making a triumphant return to Capitol Hill to meet with House and Senate Republicans, his first since sending the mob to “fight like hell” ahead of the Jan.6, 2021 attack, as GOP lawmakers find themselves newly energized and reinvigorated by his bid to retake the White House.. Despite the federal charges against Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrives Thursday emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee. He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign. . “We’re excited to welcome President Trump back,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, who led one of the lawsuits challenging the 2020 election, and had his biggest fundraising day yet after Trump's felony conviction. . The Republican speaker demurred over whether he’s asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. “Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.”. Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks to both groups at the House and Senate campaign headquarters near the U.S. Capitol and discuss issues animating his campaign — including mass immigration deportations but also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term. . In between, Trump is expected to speak at the Business Roundtable downtown which routinely invites the presumptive presidential nominees to address the executives' group. Many potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda. . But the private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump’s return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.. “It’s frustrating,” said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election.. Dunn spoke of the “irony” of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. “It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they’re truly putting party and person over country,"" he said. ""And it’s sad.”. Many of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.. Johnson met with senators on Wednesday ahead of Trump's arrival as the Republicans mapped out potential priorities.. Outgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the “disgraceful” attack that he called an “insurrection” now endorses the party’s presumptive nominee and said: ""Of course I’ll be at the meeting.”. Sen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he’s interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election and “ways in which we, as a team, and him individually can appeal to the constituencies and people that may not traditionally vote Republican.”. Thune said, “I think there’s an opportunity there to really make this a big win.”. As democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.. “This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.. Making Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as “warriors” and “patriots,” and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.. Moreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.. Republicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.. Alongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case. . When former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn’t be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.. “Paul Ryan, you’re a piece of garbage,"" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. ""We should kick you out of the party.”. Of the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.. But Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting ""he’s going to be the next president, so you have to work” together.. Asked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: “Let the day’s own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.”. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.. “Look, we’ve got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we’re like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,” Tillis said.. ___.

More significantly, he's also lost the support of former President Donald Trump, who is endorsing McGuire. Good fell out of favor with Trump when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the 2024 presidential nomination. . Good switched his endorsement to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but that failed to assuage the former president. On social media, Trump called Good “BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA."" Trump acknowledged that Good eventually gave him an endorsement, but it was too late: ""The damage has been done.”. Trump has escalated the attacks in recent days. He issued a video endorsing McGuire and warning that Good “will stab you in the back like he did me.”. McGuire has echoed the attacks, calling Good a “never Trumper,” putting Good on the defensive.. Good, for his part, says he considers Trump “the best president of my lifetime.” He says he endorsed DeSantis because he wanted a candidate who could serve two terms, and Trump is constitutionally eligible to serve only one more term.. He attacks McGuire as a serial campaigner who always has his eye on the next job.. McGuire ran for the state Senate in 2023, and within a week of winning a four-year term there announced he was running for Good's seat in Congress. In 2022, he ran for Congress in another district, the 7th, but later withdrew. In 2021, he ran for the House of Delegates and won. In 2020, he lost a primary race for the 7th District. . “He's literally a perpetual candidate in search of a race,” Good said. . Good, on the other hand, has a relatively short political resume. He served on the Campbell County Board of Supervisors, and then took on incumbent Republican congressman Denver Riggleman in 2020. He defeated Riggleman at a nominating convention as Riggleman faced blowback among social conservatives for officiating a same-sex wedding. . Good is facing payback for his efforts in McCarthy's ouster. The Republican political action committee Defending Main Street, which almost always spends money to support GOP incumbents, launched a $450,000 ad campaign against Good. . “We spend 99% of our money protecting incumbents and adding more mainstream conservatives to the House, but this was a unique situation,” said Sarah Chamberlain, the group’s president and CEO.. Good said he believes the massive ad campaigns against him are the only reason the race is close but that voters don’t care he voted for McCarthy’s ouster.. He said McCarthy “is on his revenge tour now, and I’m his biggest target.”. It might have seemed inconceivable that an incumbent with the conservative record of Good could be vulnerable in a primary, but Alex Keena, political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, said the race “has just captured the dynamics in the Republican Party right now really well.”. He said Good has “put himself on an island,” alienating mainstream Republicans by ousting McCarthy. And he lost the Trump voters because, “I guess he betrayed Trump, which is really easy to do.”. Good put it simply: McGuire, he said, “is not running to the right of me. He’s running to the Trump of me.”. McGuire and his campaign did not respond to multiple calls and emails seeking an interview.. The race has splintered the far-right Freedom Caucus, for which Good serves as chairman. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz has come to the district to support Good, while Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene campaigned for McGuire.. At a rally last week in Charlottesville — the most liberal part of the district — a few dozen McGuire supporters were outnumbered by 75 to 100 protesters who swarmed around McGuire and Greene when they got off a campaign bus.. Any efforts by McGuire and Greene to speak were drowned out by protestors chanting “Go Home!” and waving signs that said “No hate in our state.”. Neither McGuire nor Greene seemed to mind, with McGuire smiling through the chaos and Greene blowing kisses to her detractors as they responded with middle fingers.. McGuire, asked what he made of the scene, smiled and said, “Freedom!” as he retreated back to his bus.. McGuire supporters at the rally indicated that their support for the candidate stems primarily from their disappointment with Good.. “Good is a backstabber,"" said Nelson County resident Kerry Williams Thornton. ”I was with Good two years ago. ... But you cannot go with DeSantis and think that Trump is going to have your back."". 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Arizona lawmakers agree to let voters decide on retention rules for state Supreme Court justices,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/arizona-lawmakers-agree-voters-decide-retention-rules-state-111078280,2024-06-12 21:26:29,"Arizona lawmakers have voted to send an initiative to the November ballot that would protect two state Supreme Court justices targeted for removal over their support for a near-total abortion ban. PHOENIX -- Arizona lawmakers voted Wednesday to send an initiative to the November ballot that would protect two state Supreme Court justices targeted for removal from the bench over their support for a near-total abortion ban dating back to the Civil War. . Both chambers of the Legislature agreed to allow voters to decide Nov. 5 whether to eliminate the terms of six years for Supreme Court justices and four years for Superior Court judges in large counties. That will allow them to serve indefinitely “during good behavior,” unless decided otherwise by a judicial review commission, and avoid a retention vote on the ballot each time their term ends. . As a ballot initiative, the proposed law would bypass Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, a strong supporter of reproductive rights who signed a Legislature-approved repeal of the 1864 law this spring.. Several Democrats who voted against the measure noted that the retention rules were championed by the late former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who had been an Arizona state senator and Superior Court and Appellate Court judge. . The retention system “provides the kinds of checks and balances critical to our democracy,” said Sen. Flavio Bravo. “It would be a shame to take this action six months after Justice Day O'Connor's passing, and I vote no.” . Republican Sen. Dave Gowan, the bill's sponsor, noted that judges would still be subject to judicial review by a committee “to say if they don't belong.” . The measure will likely appear on the ballot alongside an initiative that would enshrine the right to abortion in the Arizona Constitution. . The final Senate vote on the judicial ballot initiative was 16-10, with four senators not voting. Republican Sen. Shawnna Bolick, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, ignored requests by several colleagues to recuse herself and voted in favor. . Justices Bolick and Kathryn Hackett King joined the majority on the high court in April in voting to restore the 1864 abortion ban. They are the only two on the Supreme Court who are up for retention votes in November. . Both were appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who expanded the court from five to seven justices in 2016. . If approved by voters, the measure would apply retroactively to Oct. 31, days before the election, and would effectively throw out the results of any vote on judicial retention this year. . If it fails and voters also opt to unseat Hackett King and Bolick, Hobbs can pick their replacements. . “They definitely are ramming it through,” said Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for Progress Arizona, a group advocating for the judges' removal. “We will continue to do our work to inform the voters that this will take away their power.”. Democrats have put abortion at the center of their quest to take control of the state Legislature for the first time in decades. Sen. Bolick, representing one of the most competitive districts, is a key target.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,The Trump campaign opens a new outreach office in a heavily Latino part of Pennsylvania,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-campaign-opens-new-outreach-office-heavily-latino-111077041,2024-06-12 21:50:19,"President Donald Trump’s campaign has teamed up with the Republican National Committee and the Pennsylvania GOP to open a “Latino Americans for Trump” office in Reading. READING, Pa. -- The pastor opened with a prayer in Spanish, asking that the Lord's spirit and guidance direct the proceedings without offering an English translation. Most of the around 50 attendees were white and weren't appearing to follow along, though they knew enough to sing out “Amen!” at the end. . Thus began former President Donald Trump 's campaign teaming up with the Republican National Committee and Pennsylvania GOP to open a “Latino Americans for Trump” office Wednesday in the town of Reading. . “We believe in the American Dream and the only way to obtain the American Dream is working hard,” Luis Fortuno, the former governor of Puerto Rico, told the same crowd. For the smaller group of Spanish speakers present, he followed with remarks that leaned heavily on the theme of “Necesitamos cambio” — Spanish for “We need change.”. Trump and top Republicans are looking to boost their support among Hispanic voters in a swing state that could well decide the election. Having shuttered many party offices that specialized in minority outreach, they are betting that promises to prioritize entrepreneurship and smaller government can resonate with a voting bloc that historically has favored Democrats. . Reading is perhaps best known as the namesake for the Reading Railroad from the Monopoly gameboard. A town of about 95,000 around 65 miles northwest of Philadelphia, Reading is 67% Latino, according to U.S. Census figures, and home to high concentrations of people of Dominican and Puerto Rican heritage. . Biden’s approval rating has dropped among Hispanic adults in national polls, but it remains unclear if Trump can capitalize.. The Reading office opening comes a week after Trump’s campaign established its first Pennsylvania office at a site in northeast Philadelphia. That event was billed as a “Blacks for Trump” gathering and featured Republican Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt and other prominent Black Republicans. . Both in Philadelphia and in Reading on Wednesday, most of the attendees were white. . Trump himself held a rally meant to energize Latino support on Sunday in Las Vegas, where he quipped: “We need every voter. I don’t care about you, I just want your vote.” The former president also said immigrants were turning the U.S. “into a dumping ground” and vowed, “We’re not going to let them destroy our country.”. President Joe Biden ’s campaign says Trump is dealing in dangerous and racist stereotypes and has dismissed his campaign's office openings as superficial patronizing of minority voters.. Biden's reelection campaign, together with the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, has opened 24 offices and has 100-plus staffers across the state, and has spent months organizing house parties and other voter mobilization efforts. It has been spending on ads in Pennsylvania since late last summer with a special emphasis on voters of Puerto Rican or Caribbean heritage. . Yrene Rodriguez, 46, an accountant at Reading Community College who said she and her whole family are Biden supporters, dismissed Wednesday's efforts by Trump's backers as “just propaganda.”. “They just want to get people to say nice things about him,” Rodriguez said. . Luis Rodriguez, who owns a real estate wholesaling and rehabbing business with offices in Pennsylvania, addressed the Trump office opening and talked about the importance of extending the U.S.-Mexico border wall, a signature promise from Trump's first campaign that he pursued in office. . Asked after the event about concerns Trump's harsh personal rhetoric might alienate some Hispanics, Rodriguez, who isn’t related to Yrene, said such suggestions don't have ""any backing or validity.”. Michael Rivera, a commissioner in Berks County, which encompasses Reading, spoke at the office opening in English and Spanish and said more effort to reach out to Hispanic voters ""demonstrates the Republican Party's understanding of the power of diversity among the American people.” . Located in a red-brick building across from a downtown CVS, the campaign office was indistinguishable from most corporate spaces, except for the placards in the front window reading “Latino Americans for Trump,"" “Stop Illegal Voting” and “Joe Biden, You’re Fired.”. Attracting more attention was a table of Trump merchandise set up for the event on the sidewalk outside. Some people walking by rolled their eyes or voiced their objections, but others were delighted with the display. . “I only want the true king. The true king of America!"" bellowed one man, loud enough to be heard inside the office. “That's Trump.” . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Runner-up criticizes Nevada GOP Senate nominee Sam Brown while other former rivals back him,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/runner-criticizes-nevada-gop-senate-nominee-sam-brown-111077040,2024-06-12 22:22:22,"Nevada GOP Senate Republican runner-up Jeff Gunter has continued his attacks on the nominee and retired Army Capt. Sam Brown. RENO, Nev. -- The bitter primary that saw nearly a dozen Republican Senate candidates swipe at retired Army Capt. Sam Brown is fading out of view for some, who say their quest to take down incumbent Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen trumps any intra-party grievances from the past 11 months.. Not runner-up Jeff Gunter.. “The America First faithful had zero interest in campaigning with him through the entire primary season where he relied on establishment influence and money to slide into a nomination,” Gunter said Wednesday after his distant second-place finish. . The dermatologist and former Trump-appointed Iceland ambassador continued to attack Brown as the establishment candidate in a lengthy statement in which he predicted outright that Rosen would win another term in November. . Gunter’s criticism could complicate early GOP efforts to coalesce around Brown. And it comes as the state Republican Party looks to move past the intra-party rifts in the primary to pivot into what is set to be among the most closely-watched Senate races of the year.. Gunter said former President Donald Trump's late endorsement of Brown, which came in a social media post hours after he appeared in Nevada before the primary, would not be enough to convince loyal Republicans to support the nominee, who avoided debates and did not engage with the other 11 candidates in the race.. “The base is smart and they do not forget and I think he has a lot to prove before earning their support,” Gunter said.. One of Gunter’s most high-profile supporters, Nevada GOP national committeewoman Sigal Chattah, struck a different tone. She said Wednesday that a historic precedent where Nevada Republicans detract from Republican nominees they don't like “died last night.” . ""Any attempts to marginalize the candidate that was elected will be met with fierce dissent from the party,” Chattah said.. For months, Brown faced criticism from within his own party, who chastised him for skipping debates, flipping his position on the status of the mothballed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, and called him the hand-picked establishment candidate of national Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Brown’s absence became more of a theme than any one policy at primary debates, with candidates explicitly urging voters not to cast their ballots for Brown.. Some of those criticisms echoed Brown’s own messaging from two years ago, when he ran in the Republican primary against Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who garnered dozens of high-profile endorsements. Laxalt defeated Brown in the primary but then lost to Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto by 8,000 votes, clinching the Senate majority for Democrats.. Chattah had previously criticized Brown for a “lack of integrity” and had pointed to a CNN report that Brown had created a political action committee to help other Republicans, then funneled the money to pay off his unsuccessful 2022 campaign. She said in an interview that her mission now is to defeat Rosen, and discouraged other Republicans from attacking Brown moving forward.. “I don’t do take-backs. So that was my sentiment,” she said when asked about the report. “Regardless of my sentiment, I’m the RNC committeewoman, and I’m a Republican. And I will support the Republican candidate unequivocally.”. Brown did not acknowledge his opponents in his victory speech on Tuesday and instead focused his attention on Rosen and President Joe Biden. . Brown's campaign again did that in a Wednesday statement when asked about Gunter's comments.. “Nevada voters are clearly united behind our grassroots campaign to end the Biden-Rosen American Nightmare. And that is what we're 100% focused on,” said communications director Kristy Wilkinson..  Trump's endorsement of Brown two days before the primary was a blow to many opponents who had angled to align themselves with the former president, but none more so than Gunter, who had branded himself as “110% pro-Trump.”. In a Monday post on X, between Trump's endorsement and Brown's commanding victory, Gunter suggested that Trump, or the people around him, got a “big check” from “the swamp” for endorsing Brown.. Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita addressed Gunter directly in his response, saying: “You have a habit of making up crap. President Trump makes his own decisions and this is another example of him choosing wisely.”. Among Brown’s opponents and detractors was former lieutenant governor candidate and Air Force veteran Tony Grady, who had campaigned for Brown during his 2022 insurgent run before running against him this cycle. More recently, Grady had called Brown a “phony politician.”. Grady said he saw Brown “out among the people” more in 2022 than in his 2024 campaign, and that skipping debates was not “necessarily putting a best foot forward.”. “But the reality is, he had a plan for running his campaign and it was successful,” said Grady, who endorsed Brown immediately after his loss and said Brown should have the votes of his supporters moving forward. “At this point, it doesn’t really matter what my thoughts are about him skipping debates. He was successful in winning the primary.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

Bob Menendez prosecution,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/new-jerseys-top-federal-prosecutor-testifies-government-sen-111075286,2024-06-12 19:58:22,"New Jersey's top federal prosecutor says Sen. Bob Menendez sought to discuss the prosecution of a New Jersey real estate developer with him before recommending him to be nominated as U.S. attorney after Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. NEW YORK -- New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor testified Wednesday at Sen. Bob Menendez 's bribery trial that the Democrat sought to discuss the prosecution of a New Jersey real estate developer with him before recommending him to the post after Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election.. U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger’s revelation in testimony that will continue on Thursday represented the second time in the five-week-old Manhattan federal court trial that a top law enforcement figure has said Menendez sought to speak about a criminal case affecting a New Jersey businessman.. Last week, a former New Jersey attorney general testified that Menendez twice confronted him about a pending criminal case affecting a New Jersey businessman, and both times the attorney general refused to discuss the subject.. Prosecutors say trying to intervene in criminal cases was one way Menendez, 70, tried to reward businessmen who paid him and his wife bribes of gold bars, tens of thousands of dollars in cash and a car.. When prosecutors charged Menendez, his wife and three businessmen last fall, they said in court papers that Menendez recommended Sellinger as U.S. attorney because he believed he could influence Sellinger to protect Fred Daibes, a prominent New Jersey real estate developer and longtime friend who faced federal criminal charges.. Daibes is standing trial with Menendez, along with another businessman, Wael Hana. All three have pleaded not guilty. A third businessman, Jose Uribe, completed four days on the witness stand on Wednesday after pleading guilty and agreeing to testify against the others.. A trial for Nadine Menendez was postponed on Wednesday until at least August, depending on the pace of her recovery from surgery for breast cancer. She too has pleaded not guilty.. Sellinger, who has held New Jersey's top federal law enforcement post since December 2021, is not accused of any wrongdoing.. He testified that he had been friends with Menendez since the early 2000s when he began contributing to his campaigns for Congress and held political fundraisers for him.. The relationship grew over time as they increasingly had dinners together and played golf with their sons, and Sellinger came to believe that Menendez would nominate him to be New Jersey's top federal prosecutor if Hillary Clinton won the 2016 presidential race, he said.. When Menendez got married in the fall of 2020, Sellinger attended the wedding, where he also had seen Daibes, Sellinger testified.. After Joe Biden won the 2020 election for president, Sellinger said he met with Menendez in his Washington office to talk about the U.S. attorney post. He said he shared his vision for the office.. Then, he said, Menendez mentioned that Daibes had a criminal case and that the senator believed he “was being treated unfairly.”. “And he said he hoped that if I became U.S. attorney, I would look at it carefully,” Sellinger recalled.. Sellinger said he told Menendez that he didn't know anything about it and that he planned to look at all cases in his office carefully.. The following day, Sellinger said, he called Menendez after recalling that he had dealt with a lawsuit that was adverse to Daibes while he was in private practice and that the Justice Department might decide to recuse him from anything involving Daibes as a result.. Sellinger recalled that Menendez said he understood, but days later, the senator told him that the White House wanted several potential candidates to be offered for nomination and he had decided he would no longer recommend Sellinger for the post.. When Sellinger learned a few months later that the person in line to get the job was no longer going to get it, he said he reached out to Menendez to remind him that he was still interested.. He said he then received a call from a political consultant who had formerly been director of Menendez's New Jersey office and was asked about his plans for the U.S. attorney's office if he got the job.. Sellinger said he repeated what he had told Menendez, including that he expected he might be recused from the Daibes case as a result of his work on the lawsuit affecting him.. Even so, though, Sellinger said Menendez told him in the spring that he was recommending he be nominated for the job.. After he was sworn in, Sellinger said, he referred his potential conflict of interest regarding Daibes to the Justice Department in Washington on his first day as U.S. attorney and was told the following week that he must have nothing to do with the case.. Three months later, he said, the political consultant asked to meet him for lunch and, after general conversation about the job, said he wanted to ask him a question.. “I said: ‘Let me stop you there,’ ” Sellinger testified. “As U.S. attorney, I'm not allowed to have any conversations about the official business of the office with any elected federal officials or their representatives.”. Sellinger said he called Menendez in spring 2022 to invite him to speak at a public ceremony celebrating Sellinger's appointment as U.S. attorney.. “He said: ‘I’m going to pass,’ ” Sellinger recalled.. Sellinger said the senator then said: “The only thing worse than not having a relationship with the United States attorney is people thinking you have a relationship with the United States attorney and you don’t.”. Assistant U.S. Attorney Lara Pomerantz asked him what he understood Menendez to be saying.. “We no longer had a relationship,” Sellinger said.. On cross-examination that will continue Thursday morning, defense attorney Avi Weitzman asked Sellinger if Menendez in the past 20 years had ever asked him to do anything improper.. “I never believed him to be asking me to do anything improper or unethical,” Sellinger answered.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. officials who track disinformation campaigns say they have issued more warnings to political candidates, government leaders and others targeted by foreign groups in recent months as America's adversaries seek to influence the outcome of the 2024 election.. Without giving specifics, an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Wednesday that the number is higher, at least in part, because “presidential elections draw more attention from our adversaries.”. The increase in notifications to targeted individuals, which began last fall, could also reflect a growing threat or the government's improved detection capabilities, or both, said the official, who was one of several to brief reporters on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the office of the director.. Lawmakers from both parties have voiced worries about the nation's preparedness for foreign disinformation during the presidential election and the corrosive impact it has on voter confidence and trust in democratic institutions. They also have questioned whether the federal government is up to the task of issuing timely and effective warnings to voters when nations like Russia and China use disinformation to try to shape American politics.. Influence operations can include false or exaggerated claims and propaganda designed to mislead voters about specific candidates, issues or races. It can also include social media posts or other digital content that seeks to suppress the vote through intimidation or by giving voters false information about election procedures.. Officials say the list of nations launching such campaigns includes familiar foes like Russia, China and Iran as well as a growing number of second-tier players like Cuba. They also noted indications that some nations allied with the U.S. could mount their own efforts to influence voters.. Russia was the top threat, one of the officials said, noting that its main objectives are degrading public support for Ukraine and eroding confidence in American democracy in general.. China is considered to be more cautious about its online disinformation campaigns and more concerned than Russia about potential blowback from the U.S., officials said. Iran is seen as a “chaos agent” that is more likely to experiment with online techniques to stoke voter anger and even violence.. Officials would not specify how many private warnings they have issued to candidates, political organizations or local election offices. Such warnings are delivered after an interagency panel of intelligence officials concludes that an influence operation could impact the outcome of an election or prevent certain groups from voting.. The notifications are only given when officials can attribute the operation to foreign sources, allowing the person or group that was targeted to “take a more defensive stance,” an official said.. The office within the intelligence community that leads the work, the Foreign Malign Influence Center, has no jurisdiction over domestic groups. The officials who briefed reporters Wednesday said they work to avoid any appearance of policing Americans' speech or playing favorites when it comes to candidates.. Intelligence officials have issued only one public warning so far — in 2020 when groups linked to Iran sent emails to Democratic voters in an apparent effort to intimidate them into voting for Donald Trump.. Powerful artificial intelligence programs that allow the rapid creation of images, audio and video pose a growing problem, as adversaries look to use the technology to create lifelike fakes that could easily mislead voters.. The use of AI has already popped up ahead of elections in India, Mexico, Moldova, Slovakia and Bangladesh, and in the U.S., where some voters in New Hampshire received an AI robocall that mimicked the voice of President Joe Biden. . AI deepfakes used by U.S. adversaries remain a top threat, officials said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A political newcomer's closer-than-expected finish in Tuesday's special congressional election in Ohio surprised Republicans and jolted Democrats in a former bellwether state both parties had all but given over to a runaway Trump victory this fall.. Democrat Michael Kripchak still lost the race for the 6th Congressional District to two-term Republican state Sen. Michael Rulli, 55, by 9.3 percentage points. Comfortable enough, but much closer than Republicans had seen previously in the district. . Former President Donald Trump carried the district, running along the Ohio River and the border with Pennsylvania, by about 30 percentage points in 2020. Former GOP Rep. Bill Johnson — whose unexpired term was up for grabs Tuesday — had won his last four elections by even more than that.. Kripchak, 42, also became the first Democratic candidate to carry the blue-collar Mahoning County — home to Youngstown and Ohio's once proud steel valley — since Trump turned it red in 2020. Kripchak leads the county by a slim margin, as votes are still being counted.. Mahoning County Republican Chairman Tom McCabe said that was pretty much on par for a purple county that often breaks close to 50/50. He noted that GOP margins lagged Trump’s performance more in several smaller rural counties, where turnouts ran as low as 8.5%. . The closer-than-expected margin likely had as much to do with lack of interest as any shift in voter sentiment.. “It’s a solid red district. We know that,” McCabe said. “We kind of went into this election knowing that, and maybe we all took it a little bit for granted on this one.”. McCabe, who also serves as county elections director, said voters may have been turned off by the nastiness of the primary or confused by the calendar. But he doesn't see that carrying over into November, when Rulli and Kripchak must face off once again for a full two-term House term.. This time, though, they'll be on the ballot with a presidential race, which he anticipates will drive 6th District turnout much higher. . “We'll make sure it's over before it starts,” he vowed confidently.. Rulli was equally confident in his victory speech. He credited Kripchak for working hard but said he was the superior retail politician, better suited to the blue-collar district.. “This is Bruce Springsteen, the forgotten man, ‘Joe Bag of Donuts.’”. Kripchak said Wednesday that he was not surprised that he performed above expectations. He said he thinks Democrats could win the district with effort and investment.. “I know there's a lot of commentary about how this is a Trumpian district, but that's not what I learned on the campaign trail,” he said. “This is a district that has felt abandoned by the Democratic Party."". Democrat Robert Hagan, retired as the area's long-time state senator, said he hopes Democrats in the district will be encouraged by the result.. “Democrats had become so discouraged, so overwhelmed by the Trumpian way of politics, how it's gotten more confrontational, and all the democratic upheaval,"" he said. “I hope this a wake-up call for those Democrats that seem to be in a discouraged state of mind that we can do this.

abcnews.com,Donald Trump's lawyers press judge to lift gag order in wake of ex-president's felony conviction,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/donald-trumps-lawyers-press-judge-lift-gag-order-111073966,2024-06-12 18:06:28,"Donald Trump’s lawyers are amplifying their calls to end the gag order that bars the former president from commenting about witnesses, jurors and others tied to the Manhattan criminal trial that ended in his conviction last month for falsifying records.... NEW YORK -- Donald Trump’s lawyers are amplifying their calls to end the gag order that bars the former president from commenting about witnesses, jurors and others tied to the Manhattan criminal trial that ended in his conviction last month for falsifying records to cover up a potential sex scandal.. In a court filing made public Wednesday, Trump’s lawyers urged Judge Juan M. Merchan to end what they deemed an “extraordinary, unprecedented, and unwarranted restriction” on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s free speech rights.. The 23-page defense filing reiterated arguments Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove made days after Trump’s May 30 guilty verdict in a letter they sent to Merchan seeking to lift the gag order. They contend the restrictions should have been rescinded after the verdict.. Prosecutors have suggested keeping that the gag order in effect at least until Trump’s sentencing on July 11, saying it’s necessary “to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice.”. Merchan issued the gag order on March 26, a few weeks before the start of the trial, after prosecutors raised concerns about Trump's propensity to assail people involved in his cases. Merchan later expanded it to bar comments about his own family after Trump made social media posts attacking the judge’s daughter, a Democratic consultant.. Comments about Merchan and District Attorney Alvin Bragg are allowed, but the gag order bars statements about court staff and members of Bragg’s prosecution team.. Blanche and Bove argued that leaving the gag order in place is unconstitutionally restricting Trump’s ability to respond to rivals and critics, including President Joe Biden’s comments in the wake of the verdict and continued public criticism from his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels, both key prosecution witnesses. Trump and Biden are scheduled to debate on June 27.. “Trump’s opponents and adversaries are using the Gag Order as a political sword to attack President Trump with reference to this case, on the understanding that his ability to mount a detailed response is severely restricted by the Gag Order,” Blanche and Bove wrote.. Trump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. She claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies.. His conviction is punishable by up to four years behind bars, but prosecutors have not said if they would seek incarceration and it’s not clear if Merchan would impose such a sentence. Other options include a fine or probation.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,North Dakota voters just approved an age limit for congressional candidates. What's next?,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/north-dakota-voters-approved-age-limit-congressional-candidates-111072394,2024-06-12 17:10:23,"North Dakota voters have just approved a ballot initiative that bars anyone who would be 81 years old during his or her U.S. House or Senate term from running for Congress. BISMARCK, N.D. -- People in their late 70s or older can no longer run for Congress in North Dakota under a ballot measure overwhelmingly approved by voters Tuesday, and legal scholars said the law could remain on the books indefinitely because no elderly candidate might challenge the restriction they deem likely unconstitutional.. Those experts view the constitutional amendment as an effort to revisit a nearly 30-year-old Supreme Court ruling against congressional term limits and could provide a potential test case for the nation. The initiative bars people from running or serving in the U.S. House or Senate if they are to turn 81 years old during their term. . The high-profile measure comes at a time when the ages of elderly officeholders have been front and center in the presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Lawmakers including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who died last year, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also have drawn attention to the issue because of their ages and health issues.. For now, the age limit stays on the books until somebody challenges it, said David Schultz, professor of political science at Hamline University and a law professor at the University of Minnesota specializing in election and constitutional law. He said the key to any challenge would be who has standing to bring a claim.. “This is like really the picky stuff of a law professor now, of the ‘who actually gets to get into the courthouse door?’” Schultz said.. He said he views the measure as unconstitutional under the 1995 term limits decision that states cannot set qualifications for Congress beyond what is already in the U.S. Constitution.. He said a potential challenge could come from someone barred by the age limit in an election — or potentially a political party seeking to nominate an older candidate. But he added any group filing suit, such as an organization representing older people, would have to show how it is harmed by the age limit.. The measure is to take effect immediately although election results still must be certified. Independent candidates have until September to file signatures to appear in the 2024 general election, meaning an age-barred candidate could theoretically emerge and be denied. The North Dakota Supreme Court would have jurisdiction over an appeal under the measure.. Schultz sees federal court as the likely path for any lawsuit. A judge and Court of Appeals would both likely be bound by the 1995 term limits ruling, he said. Then it would be a question of whether the U.S. Supreme Court takes it, he said.. “I wouldn't be surprised if a ton of money appears on both sides as it moves up the appellate chain because I'm suspecting there are interests on both sides here that would like to see the law upheld and like to see the law struck down,” Schultz said.. A state legislative panel, anticipating a lawsuit, estimated it would cost the state $1 million to defend the age limit.. The measure is vexing in two ways, said Michael Thorning, director of the Structural Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. It seems clear that even the initiative's proponents know it's likely in contradiction to the 1995 ruling. But Thorning said it's also perplexing why supporters of the measure didn't apply the age limit to state or local officers or presidential candidates “if they are concerned or confident about their argument.” . It's unclear what groups outside North Dakota or “existing constituency” would look to challenge the age limit, Thorning said. Various points could be raised, such as elderly congressmembers who are among the most effective, and whether the state constitution would now violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, Thorning said.. Notably, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas is the only member of the Supreme Court remaining from the 5-4 term limits ruling in 1995, in which he dissented, he said.. Jared Hendrix, who chaired the sponsoring committees of the age limit measure and a successful gubernatorial and legislative term limits initiative in 2022, said he thinks there probably will be a challenge, but that would depend on somebody with standing. Hendrix said the group chose 80 as the maximum age because support at that point is overwhelming.. A federal lawsuit could theoretically take years, but the courts have sometimes shown an unusual amount of speed when it comes to ballot access or candidate qualifications, such as former president Trump's eligibility in some states under the U.S. Constitution's insurrection clause, Thorning said.. U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., who is seeking reelection, opposed the measure. He said the age limit would arbitrarily limit voters' choices.. “In fact, to me, things like term limits are promoted by lazy democracy. The greatest part of our system is our self-governance, which is embodied in voting and electing people and making your own decisions,” said Cramer, 63.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

Ron DeSantis vetoed about $1 billion to bring the spending plan down to $116.5 billion. TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis spent more than an hour talking about what is in the $116.5 billion budget he signed Wednesday, but he left out the most important part of the announcement: What was in the nearly $1 billion he vetoed.. Overall, the state spending plan is slightly lower than the current budget and provides 3% raises for state employees and sets aside $1.5 billion that has to be used for teacher raises.. “All in all, I think that this is a budget that shows it can be done,” DeSantis said, saying that the state will fund major programs, provide tax relief, boost emergency savings and still have a lower budget.. But he didn't detail the biggest question budget watchers were anticipating: The cuts. The Legislature approved the budget more than three months ago, and DeSantis has been talking for weeks about what he wasn't going to veto. So the only mystery left when he signed it was what was getting the ax. . “I even had some Republican colleagues text me, saying, ”Did you get a list? Did you get a list? Did you get a list?” said Democrat Sen. Jason Pizzo.. DeSantis' office released the veto list about four hours after the governor began his budget-signing ceremony in Tampa, about a four-hour drive from the Capitol.. The 16 pages of cuts came largely from local projects and lawmaker requests, ranging from as little as $10,500 for a Taylor County public works generator to $80 million for group insurance for the state college system.. In between, there were vetoes denying vehicles to scores of police and fire departments, $6.4 million to provide free menstrual products to public school students, money for local museums and cultural events, and millions to private, non-profit organizations that help the homeless, the hungry, drug addicts and foster children.. In a show of bipartisanship, the budget passed unanimously in the Senate and 105-3 in the House, where a Republican and two Democrats opposed the spending plan.. But on late Wednesday afternoon, lawmakers were still analyzing the cuts. “I have to look at it more closely,"" Pizzo said.. One thing he did notice was that a lot of local infrastructure projects got chopped.. “As I'm sitting here stuck on a Brightline train because of flooding in my district, all those storm water projects he cut look pretty stupid right now,” Pizzo said.. ___.

abcnews.com,GOP women who helped defeat a near-total abortion ban are losing reelection in South Carolina,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/gop-women-helped-defeat-total-abortion-ban-losing-111068762,2024-06-12 17:18:17,"A near-total abortion ban was defeated in South Carolina with the help of the only three Republican women in the Senate, and now they’re losing their election bids. COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A near-total abortion ban was defeated in South Carolina with the help of the only three Republican women in the Senate, but after Tuesday’s primary, they’re losing their election bids.. Voters handed the senators – and winners of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage award for people who risk their careers for the greater good – two losses and a runoff after they joined with Democratic women to defeat the measure, saying a pregnant woman shouldn’t lose control of her body as soon as an egg is fertilized.. But the state had only men in the Senate in 2012 and may end up without a single Republican woman in the chamber in 2025. There are just two Democratic women among the 46 members.. “You can’t tell me that’s not a slap in the face of women,” said Sen. Katrina Shealy who is gearing up for a runoff. “Republican women lose like this over one issue when we fought so hard for other things.”. Voters on Tuesday went against a trend of having second thoughts about more restrictive abortion law. . Statewide polling has indicated a near total ban doesn’t have wide support. But turnout was low and races were in Republican-drawn districts, where experts say voters tend to be more fervent about issues like abortion.. The Republican women had forced a compromise, and the state eventually implemented a ban once cardiac activity is detected, typically around six weeks after conception.. “It’s easier to fight mini battles than it is to take on a whole statewide war,” said Dave Wilson, a conservative political consultant who has worked with groups opposing abortion. “In the mini battles, voters can turn around and say they aren’t happy with the stance you took and the way you went about it. It doesn’t take a lot of them.”. Abortion wasn’t the only reason Penry Gustafson lost, said her sole opponent, Allen Blackman, who believes life begins at conception. Gustafson had less than 20% of the vote in a freshly redrawn district that no longer included her base, and where constituents complained she didn’t solve their problems.. Sen. Sandy Senn’s loss by just 31 votes to state Rep. Matt Leber is close enough for a recount, but those rarely alter a race by more than a few votes in South Carolina. The race was fraught with accusations. She posted signs with Leber’s mugshot, which he said were from inflated accusations that never led to convictions.. Leber’s attacks misconstrued Senn’s record and manipulated photos to make her look like the Joker, a DC Comics villain.. Redistricting may have hurt Senn too; her redrawn Charleston district includes more conservatives.. Gustafson thanked her supporters in a Wednesday statement, promising to continue serving the community. Senn isn't going to talk about the race until the recount is finished later this week, she said in an email. Neither woman mentioned abortion.. Leber did not responded to messages.. Shealy was the only Republican woman to survive the night, but she got just 40% of the vote. She will face attorney and political newcomer Carlisle Kennedy in the June 25 runoff.. Billboards saying Shealy was not “pro-life” were all over her district in Lexington County, which led the charge to flip the state from Democratic to Republican control over the past five decades. Kennedy did not respond to messages Wednesday.. Shealy’s strategy for the primary was to stay above the fray. She will likely change tactics for the runoff, even if that alienates people uncomfortable when a woman raises her voice or takes a stand, she said Wednesday.. South Carolina’s Senate had been all-male for four years when Shealy was first elected in 2012 and rarely had more than one woman in the chamber. If she loses, there is a very good chance the Senate in 2025 will have just two women, both Democrats.. That means the perspective of women, who make up 55% of the registered voters in South Carolina, can get lost and issues she champions like free lunch for all schoolchildren may be ignored, she said.. “I broke that ceiling not for abortion rights — I broke it because we needed someone to care about children and families and veterans and old people,” Shealy said. “All these people no one was taking care of. I came in there and gave them a voice.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

French elections delay plans for 2030 edition,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/salt-lake-city-track-2034-olympics-vote-french-111067423,2024-06-12 16:38:28,"Salt Lake City is still cruising toward being named the 2034 Winter Olympics host next month. LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- While Salt Lake City is cruising toward being named the 2034 Winter Olympics host next month, the French parliamentary elections suddenly called by President Emmanuel Macron have created a bump in the road for the 2030 edition that the French Alps bid is expected to win.. Voting to confirm both expected Winter Games hosts is still the plan on July 24 in Paris, on the eve of the next Summer Games, the International Olympic Committee said Wednesday.. However, Macron’s surprise announcement Sunday of two rounds of national elections on June 30 and July 7 — and a possible change of government, if not the presidency — is delaying signing off paperwork that the IOC demands. Macron acted after far-right opponents made gains in European parliamentary elections.. The IOC’s long-scheduled executive board meeting that opened Wednesday aimed to lock down putting forward both the 2030 and 2034 candidates for rubber-stamping votes in Paris.. Instead, financial and organizational guarantees sought from national and regional levels of government will now have just over two weeks to be completed before the IOC holds its annual meeting for about 100 members.. A French bid uniting the snowy Alps region and the French Riviera resort Nice came together last year.. The timeline of barely 5½ years to prepare for a scheduled opening ceremony in February 2030 in the south of France is already the tightest any modern Olympic host has faced.. “Between the 7th of July and the IOC Session in Paris we will reach this confirmation about the guarantees,” said Karl Stoss, the IOC member overseeing the Salt Lake City and French Alps projects for the Olympic body.. “This is very clear for us. We are very confident with this one,” Stoss said at an online briefing.. Each candidate for 2030 and 2034 has had no rival since entering exclusive talks with the IOC last November. That move left competing bids from Sweden and Switzerland out in the cold.. Salt Lake City previously hosted the Winter Olympics in 2002, after a bid campaign that became notorious for IOC members getting perks and favors. Several later were expelled or resigned.. France previously hosted three Winter Olympics at Chamonix in 1924, Grenoble in 1968 and Albertville in 1992.. ___.

A Republican incumbent on a commission that has a hand in overseeing elections in Nevada's major swing county has fended off a far-right challenge and secured her party's nomination in a race that could have had implications for national elections.. Heading into Nevada's primary on Tuesday, the incumbent, Clara Andriola, had been facing a challenge from the far right for her seat on the Washoe County Board of Commissioners, part of an ongoing effort by election conspiracy theorists who want to create a majority on the board that has some important oversight of the county elections office.. Washoe includes Reno and is the second-largest county by population in the key presidential and Senate battleground state.. Andriola has said that administering elections should not be a partisan issue. In a statement Wednesday, she said her primary victory “is validation that Washoe County voters care about policy, not politics.”. Andriola is likely favored to win reelection from her district, which covers a reliably Republican-leaning part of the county.. The commission’s authority over its election department includes appointing the registrar of voters, certifying the vote counts, identifying polling locations and providing ballots in Spanish in a county where the population is about one-quarter Latino. The state and courts provide a safeguard against any local manipulation of elections.. The effort to unseat Andriola was backed by wealthy far-right political activist Robert Beadles, who has been trying for years to tip the balance of power on the commission further to the right: He has publicly spread rumors about the family lives of officials he opposes, unsuccessfully sued to oust county officials and roll back protections for election workers, and led a local movement that has encouraged officials to avoid certifying election results and overhaul the elections department.. Beadles didn't respond to emailed requests for comment.. Against this backdrop, Washoe County commission meetings are regularly filled with heated rhetoric about “puppet masters” manipulating elections, false accusations of stolen votes and conspiracy theories about voting machines. The claims stem from the repeated lies promoted by former President Donald Trump.. Through his political action committee, Beadles endorsed Mark Lawson, a former fire chief from nearby Sparks, for Andriola's seat. Lawson has said he’s skeptical of the 2020 presidential election results.. Lawson conceded the race to Andriola, but in a text message Wednesday to the AP, he said he hopes she recognizes “her lack of support with so many voters"" because of her bipartisan votes that have created a familiar split on the five-member commission, which currently includes Andriola, two Democrats, and two Republicans financially backed by Beadles.. Ahead of Nevada's primary, Andriola had campaigned on relaxing business restrictions and supporting voter ID, but her bipartisan votes earned her a censure by the county GOP, which rejected the 2020 election results.. The dynamic unfolding in the politically mixed region of northern Nevada is similar to dramas that have played out elsewhere, including in neighboring Arizona, another swing state where conspiracy theorists have targeted local boards and elections offices the past several years.. Multiple reviews, recounts and audits in the states where Trump disputed his 2020 loss have affirmed President Joe Biden’s win, and there has been no evidence of widespread fraud.. ___.

abcnews.com,Wisconsin Supreme Court keeps ban on mobile absentee voting sites in place for now,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/wisconsin-supreme-court-ban-mobile-absentee-voting-sites-111060663,2024-06-12 15:10:17,"The Wisconsin Supreme Court has kept a lower court’s ruling banning the use of mobile voting sites in the upcoming presidential election in place for now, a win for Republicans. MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court kept a lower court's ruling banning the use of mobile voting sites in the upcoming presidential election in place for now, a win for Republicans.. However, in a victory for Democrats, the court also ensured late Tuesday that municipalities across the battleground state can use the same method in place since 2016 to determine where to locate early voting sites for the upcoming August primary and November presidential election.. They just can't use mobile sites, like Racine did in 2022 when it allowed ballots to be cast in a van that traveled around the city.. The order came just ahead of Wednesday's deadline for municipalities to designate alternate locations for voters to cast early, absentee ballots. . Wisconsin state law prohibits locating any early voting site in a place that gives an advantage to any political party. At issue in the current case is how to interpret that law.. The Racine County Circuit Court said in January that the mobile voting vans in Racine were not allowed under the law. Additionally, the van was placed in areas that were advantageous to Democrats, also in violation of the law, the court ruled.. The court said state law means that an advantage to a political party can only be avoided if voters in the immediate vicinity of the early voting location cast their ballots exactly the same as voters who live in the immediate vicinity of the municipal clerk’s office.. The Supreme Court put that interpretation on hold Tuesday. . “At this stage, just months before the August primary and November general elections, there is a risk that the circuit court’s ruling will disrupt ongoing preparations for those elections by creating uncertainty about which sites may be designated as alternate absentee balloting locations,” the court said in its 4-3 order supported by the liberal majority.. Justice Rebecca Bradley, one of the three dissenting conservative justices, said the order by the liberal majority was the latest in an “ongoing effort to resolve cases in a manner benefitting its preferred political party.”. Bradley said that putting a court’s interpretation of the law on hold is “without precedent, and for good reason — doing so is nonsensical.” She and the other two conservative justices agreed with the four liberal justices in keeping the court’s ban on mobile voting sites in place.. The underlying case proceeds in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is expected to schedule oral arguments in the fall, too late to affect absentee voting rules for this year's elections.. While the case is proceeding, the elections commission asked the Supreme Court to put the earlier court ruling on hold in light of Wednesday's deadline for selecting early voting sites.. The Supreme Court on Tuesday said there was little harm in granting a stay that would keep the same criteria in place for determining early voting locations that has been used since 2016. But it declined to lift the ban on mobile voting sites, a win for Republicans.. The van was first used in Racine’s municipal elections in 2022. It was purchased with grant money Racine received from the Center for Tech and Civic Life, the nonprofit funded by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife. Republicans have been critical of the grants, calling the money “Zuckerbucks” that they say was used to tilt turnout in Democratic areas.. Wisconsin voters in April approved a constitutional amendment banning the use of private money to help run elections.. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, on behalf of Racine County Republican Party Chairman Ken Brown, brought the lawsuit after the state elections commission said use of the van in Racine did not break the law.. “We are happy that Racine’s illegal voting van will not be in use for the upcoming elections,"" WILL attorney Lucas Vebber said in a statement.. Racine officials, the Democratic National Committee and the Milwaukee-based voting advocacy group Black Leaders Organizing for Communities joined with the elections commission in defending the use of the van.. Timothy White, spokesperson for President Joe Biden's campaign in Wisconsin, said the portion of the order keeping the same criteria in place for picking early voting sites was a “win for democracy.” . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

NEW YORK -- About half of U.S. adults approve of Donald Trump's recent felony conviction, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The survey shows some potential vulnerabilities, along with some signs of resilience in his support, as Trump tries to become the first American with a felony record to win the presidency.. Less than five months before Election Day, the poll paints a picture of a nation with firmly entrenched opinions of the divisive former Republican president. Overall views of Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden remain unchanged since before the guilty verdict in Trump's New York hush money trial. . But the findings also suggest that Trump's conviction is one more weakness among disaffected Republicans. While most people in the United States have heard about the conviction, political independents are less likely to be paying attention and more likely to have a neutral opinion of Trump's conviction, indicating that there may still be room for the campaigns to sway them.. Nancy Hauser, a 74-year-old independent from West Palm Beach, Florida, said she approves of Trump’s conviction based on the little she followed of the trial. The verdict, she said, suggests that Trump may be willing to engage in criminal activity if he were back in the White House.. “I feel if you’ve been convicted of a crime, especially a felony, a serious crime, how can you run a country?” she said.. But she also has concerns about Biden, especially his age and leadership on the economy and the war in Israel. Biden is 81, while Trump turns 78 on Friday.. “I’m not sure who I’m voting for,” Hauser said. “That’s the sad part.”. Overall, U.S. adults are more likely to approve of Trump's conviction than they are to disapprove, according to a survey of 1,115 adults nationwide conducted over three days beginning a week after the verdict was delivered May 30, and before Biden's son Hunter was convicted in a federal gun case on Tuesday. . About 3 in 10 somewhat or strongly disapprove of Trump's conviction, and about 2 in 10 do not approve or disapprove. Perspectives were similar among registered voters, with about half saying the conviction was the right choice.. Republicans are less united on the verdict than are Democrats. Roughly 6 in 10 Republicans somewhat or strongly disapprove of the conviction, while 15% of Republican adults approve and about 2 in 10 Republicans neither approve nor disapprove. Among Democrats, by contrast, more than 8 in 10 somewhat or strongly approve.. About half of Americans say that the conviction was politically motivated, while a similar share think it was not. Nearly half of Republicans who have an unfavorable view of Trump do not see the conviction as politically motivated, compared with less than 1 in 10 Republicans who have a positive opinion of him.. Overall opinions of Trump barely budged. . About 6 in 10 U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, which is in line with findings from an AP-NORC poll conducted in February. Four in 10 have a favorable view of Trump, also largely unchanged since February.. The numbers are equally poor for Biden: 4 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable view of the Democratic president, while about 6 in 10 have a negative one. . Ron Schwartz, a 59-year-old self-described moderate Republican who lives in Dallas, said that Trump was “probably guilty” of the alleged crimes, although Schwartz believes politics were a major factor in the case.. He said the charges should not have been felonies, a level of crime that blocks those convicted from owning guns or voting in many states. Still, Schwartz plans to vote for Trump, as he did in the past two presidential elections, despite having serious concerns about the former president’s character.. “I think he’s a disgusting human being,” Schwartz said. “But he has some good policies and good ideas.”. Independents are split on Trump overall: About 4 in 10 have a positive view, while a similar share have a negative view. A plurality — nearly half — did not express a strong opinion on the conviction, saying they did not approve or disapprove. . Cassi Carey, a 60-year-old independent who lives in suburban Milwaukee, said the conviction does not reflect well on Trump, although she acknowledges she was not paying close attention to the specifics.. “I think Trump is a terrible choice for our country because of his divisiveness,” Carey said. She also lamented the advanced age of Biden, who turns 82 in November.. “Someday in my lifetime, I want very much to be able to vote for a candidate and not against a candidate,” she said. . Overall, Americans are more likely to see Trump's conviction as bad for the nation.. About 4 in 10 adults describe it as a bad thing for the country overall, while about one-third say it was a good thing and about 2 in 10 say it is neither. As for the U.S. democratic system, about 4 in 10 say the conviction is a good thing, with roughly the same share calling it a bad thing.. Trump continues to be overwhelmingly disliked by Democrats: 9 in 10 Democrats have an unfavorable view of him, with roughly 8 in 10 saying their opinion is “very unfavorable."" . Democrat Oscar Baza, a 29-year-old Mexican immigrant who lives in Los Angeles, said he approves of the Trump verdict, which is evidence of “the judicial process working as it should.”. “I just think it’s really worrisome that he’s on the ballot,” Baza said. “If you’ve been convicted of 34 counts of anything, you probably shouldn’t be leading anything, you should be going to therapy.”. ___.

WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — First lady Jill Biden is kicking off her husband's outreach to older voters, an effort that will blend rallies and phone banks with social events like bingo nights and pickleball games.. While President Joe Biden is in Italy attending the Group of Seven summit, the first lady will travel to four swing states to launch the Seniors for Biden-Harris effort. Older adults are more likely than the average American to vote, and they make up larger shares of the population in some key swing states. Biden, who outperformed previous Democrats with the demographic in 2020, is looking to expand on the gains as his campaign seeks to maximize its chances of defeating former President Donald Trump, the Republican presumptive nominee.. Jill Biden's travels will take her to Green Bay, Wisconsin; Duluth, Minnesota; Reno, Nevada; and Phoenix, the campaign said. While her events will feel like traditional rallies, the campaign also plans to use pickleball events and bingo nights to motivate older voters and keep them activated to help the campaign heading into November.. “Seniors are such a critical part of our coalition, and it is vitally important that we engage them this election cycle because they know President Biden is the only candidate in this race fighting for lower prescription drug and health care costs and to protect and safeguard Medicare and Social Security,” Biden campaign manager Julia Chavez Rodriguez said. ""Dr. Biden is both a trusted voice for seniors speaking to the issues that matter most to them and a galvanizing force to activate our supporters ahead of the election.”. Jill Biden had spent much of the last 10 days at a federal courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware, supporting her son Hunter Biden, who on Tuesday was convicted on federal firearms charges.

abcnews.com,"Republicans stick to attacking criminal justice system, echoing Trump, after Hunter Biden conviction",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/republicans-echo-trump-response-hunter-biden-conviction-111051903,2024-06-12 19:02:27,"Republicans loyal to Donald Trump are largely echoing the former president’s claim that the Justice Department has treated President Joe Biden’s son with kid gloves while zealously prosecuting Trump. PHOENIX -- Republicans are responding to Hunter Biden's conviction on federal gun charges with some version of, “That’s it?”. Loyal to Donald Trump, they largely echoed the former president's claim that the Justice Department has treated President Joe Biden's son with kid gloves while zealously prosecuting Trump. Using the attention given to Hunter Biden's conviction for charges related to buying a gun while addicted to drugs, they pressed unsubstantiated or debunked allegations that Joe Biden — while vice president — acted to advance his family members’ foreign business interests.. The GOP's argument that Joe Biden is ordering prosecutors to target political opponents has been hurt by the Biden-led Justice Department prosecuting the president's son — with Biden declining to stop the investigation or pardon Hunter Biden. But in making that case, Republicans may be trying to deflect from Trump's own stated intentions to wield the criminal justice system against opponents if he returns to the White House.. While president, Trump tried to undercut the Justice Department investigation into his campaign's alleged ties to Russia and issued pardons to a raft of former campaign aides, friends and donors. And on the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly declared he is the victim of a “rigged” system and promised to appoint a special prosecutor to target Biden and his family. . House Republicans voted Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress, further escalating their battle with the Justice Department. . And Trump sent a fundraising email with the subject line, “Haul out the Guillotine!” The email claimed Trump’s critics have a “Sick Dream” to see him beheaded, the latest example of Trump's inflammatory rhetoric since his hush money conviction. . In a deal with prosecutors last year, Hunter Biden was supposed to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and avoid prosecution in the gun case if he stayed out of trouble for two years. But the deal fell apart after the judge, who was nominated by Trump, questioned unusual aspects of the proposed agreement, and the lawyers could not resolve the matter.. He was convicted Tuesday and faces a potential 25 years in prison, though as a first-time offender he is likely to get far less time or avoid prison entirely. . He still faces a trial in September in California on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes, and congressional Republicans have signaled they will keep going after him in their stalled impeachment effort into the president. The president has not been accused or charged with any wrongdoing by prosecutors investigating his son.. Biden definitively ruled out pardoning his son during an ABC News interview last week. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday did not rule out the president issuing a potential commutation that might reduce or erase a sentence while leaving the conviction intact. . Hunter Biden’s conviction came weeks after a New York jury found Trump guilty of 34 counts related to a hush money payment to a porn actor during the 2016 campaign. Trump falsely claims the verdict was “rigged.” Biden said he accepted his son’s verdict. . Trump’s campaign issued a statement calling the Hunter Biden verdict “nothing more than a distraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family.” Several of his allies followed. . “Remember this was Joe Biden’s corrupt DOJ that tried to negotiate outside immunity unrelated to this case,"" said Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican and a contender to be Trump's vice presidential running mate. “Today is the first step in delivering accountability for the Biden Crime Family.”. Sen. J.D. Vance, an Ohio Republican and another vice presidential contender, shared a post by Ohio Republican Senate candidate Bernie Moreno saying the gun charges were meant to “insulate and protect” the president. . Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the guilty verdict was “appropriate” and didn't undercut his own criticism of a two-tiered system of justice for Trump and the Bidens.. “Every case is different,” Johnson said. ""And clearly the evidence was overwhelming here. I don’t think that’s the case in the Trump trial, and all the charges that have been brought against him have been obviously brought for political purposes. Hunter Biden is a separate incident.”. Democrats did not attack the Justice Department or the courts. Said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the No. 3 House Democrat: “Hunter Biden sat before a jury of his peers, a verdict was rendered and House Democrats believe in the rule of law, and so we respect that ruling.”. As president, Trump repeatedly sought to shape the criminal inquiry into whether his 2016 presidential campaign had conspired with Russia.. He fired the FBI director who led the investigation, berated the attorney general he appointed for recusing himself from overseeing the probe and directed his White House counsel to seek the termination of special counsel Robert Mueller. Those acts, and others, contributed to an investigation into whether he had illegally sought to obstruct the Russia inquiry; Mueller did find evidence of obstruction but declined to make a finding about whether Trump had broken the law.. More recently, Trump and allies have suggested that if elected he might advocate the imprisonment of political opponents, something he championed even before he became president.. In a Fox & Friends interview this month, he falsely asserted that he had not used the words “lock her up” in reference to Hillary Clinton and his 2016 opponent’s use of a private email server to transmit sensitive information as secretary of state. He said he could’ve sought to have her jailed but that it “would have been a terrible thing.”. He suggested things are different now that he faces four felony indictments, including the New York case that resulted in a conviction. . “And then this happened to me, and so I may feel differently about it,” he said.. The charges against Hunter Biden stem from a dark period in his life, during which he acknowledges a spiraling descent following the death of his brother, Beau Biden, to cancer in 2015. Jurors found him guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer when he bought a revolver in 2018, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.. Many in Trump’s Republican Party are staunchly against gun control and some of his supporters have questioned whether Hunter Biden should have been tried on the gun charges. . Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and high-profile Trump supporter, posted on X, “The Hunter Biden gun conviction is kinda dumb.”. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters at the Capitol that the gun charge was a ""waste of time,” though he said other accusations related to Hunter Biden’s taxes were “serious.”. “I just think he’s being punished,” Graham said, adding the average person would be “put in drug diversion or something.”. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., made similar comments. . “Hunter might deserve to be in jail for something, but purchasing a gun is not it,” Massie posted on X. “There are millions of marijuana users who own guns in this country, and none of them should be in jail for purchasing or possessing a firearm against current laws.”. ___.

abcnews.com,House votes to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for withholding Biden audio,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/house-moves-hold-attorney-general-merrick-garland-contempt-111051619,2024-06-12 20:46:18,"The House has voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio of President Joe Biden’s interview in his classified documents case. WASHINGTON -- The House voted Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio of President Joe Biden’s interview in his classified documents case, Republicans' latest and strongest rebuke of the Justice Department as partisan conflict over the rule of law animates the 2024 presidential campaign. . The 216-207 vote fell along party lines, with Republicans coalescing behind the contempt effort despite reservations among some of the party's more centrist members. Only one Republican — Rep. David Joyce of Ohio — voted against it.. Garland said in a statement late Wednesday, “It is deeply disappointing that this House of Representatives has turned a serious congressional authority into a partisan weapon. Today’s vote disregards the constitutional separation of powers, the Justice Department’s need to protect its investigations, and the substantial amount of information we have provided to the Committees."". He added, ""I will always stand up for this Department, its employees, and its vital mission to defend our democracy.”. Garland is now the third attorney general to be held in contempt of Congress. Yet it is unlikely that the Justice Department — which Garland oversees — will prosecute him. The White House’s decision to exert executive privilege over the audio recording, shielding it from Congress, would make it exceedingly difficult to make a criminal case against Garland. . Nonetheless, Speaker Mike Johnson defended the decision to push ahead with what is now a mostly symbolic effort. . “Look, we did our job on the contempt, and I think it sends an important message,” the Louisiana Republican said following the vote. ""We’ll see what happens next, but, I mean, the House has to do its work and I’m pleased with the outcome today.”. The White House and congressional Democrats have slammed Republicans’ motives for pursuing contempt and dismissed their efforts to obtain the audio as purely political. They also pointed out that Rep. Jim Jordan, the GOP chair of the House Judiciary Committee, defied his own congressional subpoena last session. . “This contempt resolution will do very little, other than smear the reputation of Merrick Garland, who will remain a good and decent public servant no matter what Republicans say about him today,"" New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on Judiciary Committee, said during floor debate. . Garland has defended the Justice Department, saying officials have gone to extraordinary lengths to provide information to the committees about Special Counsel Robert Hur’s classified documents investigation, including a transcript of Biden’s interview with him.. “There have been a series of unprecedented and frankly unfounded attacks on the Justice Department,” Garland said in a press conference last month. “This request, this effort to use contempt as a method of obtaining our sensitive law enforcement files is just most recent.” . Republicans were incensed when Hur declined to prosecute Biden over his handling of classified documents and quickly opened an investigation. GOP lawmakers — led by Jordan and Rep. James Comer — sent a subpoena for audio of Hur’s interviews with Biden during the spring. But the Justice Department only turned over some of the records, leaving out audio of the interview with the president. . On the last day to comply with the Republicans' subpoena for the audio, the White House blocked the release by invoking executive privilege. It said that Republicans in Congress only wanted the recordings “to chop them up” and use them for political purposes.. Executive privilege gives presidents the right to keep information from the courts, Congress and the public to protect the confidentiality of decision-making, though it can be challenged in court.. Administrations of both political parties have long held the position that officials who assert a president’s claim of executive privilege can’t be prosecuted for contempt of Congress, a Justice Department official told Republicans last month. . Assistant Attorney General Carlos Felipe Uriarte cited a committee’s decision in 2008 to back down from a contempt effort after President George W. Bush asserted executive privilege to keep Congress from getting records involving Vice President Dick Cheney.. Before Garland, the last attorney general held in contempt was Bill Barr in 2019. That was when the Democratically controlled House voted to issue a referral against Barr after he refused to turn over documents related to a special counsel investigation into Trump. . Years before that, then-Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt related to the gun-running operation known as Operation Fast and Furious. In each of those instances, the Justice Department took no action against the attorney general. . The special counsel in Biden’s case, Hur, spent a year investigating the president’s improper retention of classified documents, from his time as a senator and as vice president. The result was a 345-page report that questioned Biden’s age and mental competence but recommended no criminal charges for the 81-year-old. Hur said he found insufficient evidence to successfully prosecute a case in court.. In March, Hur stood by his no-prosecution assessment in testimony before the Judiciary Committee, where he was grilled for more than four hours by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.. His defense did not satisfy Republicans, who insist that there is a politically motivated double standard at the Justice Department, which is prosecuting former President Donald Trump over his retention of classified documents at his Florida club after he left the White House.. But there are major differences between the two probes. Biden’s team returned the documents after they were discovered, and the president cooperated with the investigation by voluntarily sitting for an interview and consenting to searches of his homes. . Trump, by contrast, is accused of enlisting the help of aides and lawyers to conceal the documents from the government and of seeking to have potentially incriminating evidence destroyed.. __ Associated Press writers Kevin Freking and Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Milei's radical overhaul advances in Argentina's Senate as protesters clash with police,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/argentinas-senate-accepted-president-mileis-radical-overhaul-now-111081881,2024-06-13 03:34:26,"Argentina’s Senate began what’s likely to be an all-night voting marathon on the details of President Javier Milei’s sweeping proposals to slash spending and boost his own powers after giving the plan overall approval in a narrow vote. BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina's Senate began what's likely to be an all-night voting marathon on the details of President Javier Milei 's sweeping proposals to slash spending and boost his own powers early Thursday, shortly after giving the plan overall approval in a narrow vote as thousands of protesters clashed with police outside.. Senators voted 37 to 36 late Wednesday to give provisional approval to the two bills after a daylong heated debate while thousands of protesters poured into the streets, burning cars and throwing Molotov cocktails as hundreds of federal security forces pushed back with rounds of tear gas and water cannons. . The vote — decided by a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Victoria Villarruel — delivered a major boost to Milei, whose efforts to overhaul the government and economy have run into tough resistance in Argentina's opposition-dominated Congress. . “Tonight is a triumph for the Argentine people and the first step toward the recovery of our greatness,"" Milei posted on X, calling his bills “the most most ambitious legislative reform of the last 40 years.” . But critical elements of the wide-ranging legislation still have to survive an article-by-article vote in the Senate. After that, the bill heads back to the lower house, where lawmakers must okay any modifications before Milei can officially claim his first legislative victory.. Right-wing and left-wing lawmakers have clashed over various parts of the 238-article state reform bill, including the declaration of a one-year state of emergency and delegation of broad powers to the president in energy, pensions, security and other matters until the end of Milei's term in 2027. . Other controversial measures include an incentive scheme that would give investors lucrative tax breaks for 30 years. . Milei is a political outsider with just two years' experience as a lawmaker, and his 3-year-old party, Liberty Advances, holds just 15% of seats in the lower house and 10% of the Senate. . He has been unable to pass a single piece of legislation in his six months of presidency, raising questions about whether he can execute his ambitious project to trim the deficit and spur growth. Instead, he's used executive powers to slash subsidies, fire thousands of public employees, devalue the currency and deregulate parts of the Argentine economy.. The spending cuts and currency devaluation that Milei has delivered have — at least in the short term — deepened a recession, increased poverty to 55% and sent annual inflation surging toward 300%. . “If this law passes, we are going to lose so many of our labor and pension rights,” said 54-year-old teacher Miriam Rajovitcher, protesting ahead of the vote alongside colleagues who say they’ve had to reconfigure their lives since Milei slashed school budgets and devalued the currency. “I am so much worse off.” . Analysts say the promised benefits of Milei's reforms — a stable currency, tamer inflation, fresh foreign investment — won't materialize without a political consensus to convince foreign investors that his changes are here to stay. Milei's administration has said it wants to strike a new deal with the International Monetary Fund, to which Argentina already owes $44 billion.. “Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode,” said Marcelo J. García, Americas director at geopolitical risk firm Horizon Engage. “Investors say, ’Yes, we love what you’re saying, but we need to see that this is sustainable.” . Milei's allies said they had made tough concessions Wednesday. His party, Liberty Advances, agreed not to sell off the country's post office, flagship airline Aerolíneas Argentinas, or the public radio service, leaving just a handful of state-owned firms, including Argentina's nuclear power company, on the block for possible privatization. . Milei's original pitch late last year to privatize more than 40 state-owned Argentine companies prompted an uproar from the country's powerful Peronist-dominated labor movement.. That was audible ahead of the Senate vote Wednesday in downtown Buenos Aires, as bankers, teachers, truckers and thousands of union members and activists converged around Congress. They chanted: “Our country is not for sale!” . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden's grip on a key federal energy commission will last beyond his first term, giving a boost to the Democrat's push for renewable energy regardless of the election results in November.. The Senate moved to ensure that political reality as lawmakers approved two new members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and set up a vote on a third new panelist as soon as Thursday.. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said confirmation of the three nominees would allow FERC to ""keep its quorum and continue its mission of providing Americans with affordable, reliable, safe energy.''. The five-member commission oversees natural gas pipelines and other energy infrastructure, including transmission of electricity across state lines. The panel approved a long-awaited rule last month making it easier to transmit renewable energy such as wind and solar power to the electric grid — a key part of Biden’s goal to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 2050. The rule is aimed at boosting the nation’s aging power grid to meet surging demand fueled by huge data centers, electrification of vehicles and buildings, artificial intelligence and other uses.. Earlier this week, the agency approved a request by the nearly $8 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline to begin sending natural gas across rugged mountainsides in West Virginia and Virginia, despite longstanding objections from environmental groups, landowners and some elected officials. . On Wednesday, the Senate approved the nominations of Democrat David Rosner and Republican Lindsay See for three and four-year terms, respectively, on the commission. Senators also limited debate on Democrat Judy Chang’s nomination to a five-year term. A final vote on Chang’s nomination to replace Democrat Allison Clements could occur as soon as Thursday.. If approved as expected, the vote would give Democrats a working majority on the commission until at least June 2026, when the term of Democratic Chairman Willie Phillips is set to expire.. “A fully seated, bipartisan FERC provides more opportunity for advancing long-lasting, sensible energy infrastructure policy,'' said West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat-turned-independent who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.. “When it comes to fairly assessing all interests, five heads are better than one,'' Manchin said Wednesday. “Bringing together five different people, with five different life experiences and perspectives, helps ensure that all affected interests will be heard and fairly considered and assessed'' by the energy commission.. Rosner, See and Chang “are very different people, from very different backgrounds,'' said Manchin, who supported all three nominees. ""What matters most is their willingness to work with one another, to consider and assess fairly different interests and points of view, and to put partisan passions aside in favor of the public interest.''. Rosner, a former FERC staffer, has spent the past two years on Manchin's Democratic staff on the energy committee. See, who serves as solicitor general for the state of West Virginia, argued the state's case challenging a major U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule on power plant pollution before the Supreme Court. Chang, of Massachusetts, is a former undersecretary of energy and climate solutions for the state government.. Manchin said he knows Rosner well: ""I have seen firsthand his expert knowledge on energy issues, his fairness, his nonpartisan approach to every problem we’ve had, and his ability to work with both sides on these issues, and he’s done that tremendously.''. Manchin, a political moderate who plays a crucial role on energy issues, called See “a very capable and experienced lawyer” who is ""well-qualified to serve on the commission.''. Chang, who now teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School, led energy policy under Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. “I can think of no better preparation for serving on a bipartisan commission than working for a Republican administration in a very blue state,'' Manchin said.. Rosner's nomination was approved, 67-27, while See won approval, 83-12.. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia opposed both nominations, saying he continued to be unhappy about federal approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a longtime Manchin priority.. “I voted no on rubber-stamping the same old people to FERC,” Kaine said in a statement.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

NEW YORK -- Eight former employees sued SpaceX and its CEO Elon Musk, alleging that Musk ordered them fired after they challenged what they called rampant sexual harassment and a hostile “Animal House”-style work environment at the company. . The employees, who filed suit in a California state court, detailed their complaints in a 2022 open letter to management they shared via a company intranet. The next day, four of the plaintiffs were fired, they alleged; others were terminated later after an internal investigation.. In January, the federal National Labor Relations Board filed its own complaint against SpaceX based on issues raised by nine fired employees.. Among other workplace concerns, the open letter called on executives to condemn Musk’s public behavior on X — the platform then known as Twitter — and to hold all employees accountable for unacceptable conduct. Musk’s actions included making light of sexual harassment allegations against him — charges that the billionaire denied.. “As our CEO and most prominent spokesperson, Elon is seen as the face of SpaceX — every tweet that Elon sends is a de facto public statement by the company,” the open letter said at the time. The letter also referred to Musk’s actions as a ”frequent source of distraction and embarrassment.”. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages.. The complaint drew connections between Musk's behavior — in particular, his often lewd posts on Twitter — and the working environment at SpaceX. It states that one of the plaintiffs, Yaman Abdulhak, noted that many of the inappropriate examples cited in a 2021 “appropriate behavior” employee training “closely resembled the contents of Musk's tweets.” Abdulhak sent examples of those tweets to the SpaceX human resources director, who took no action, the complaint stated.. SpaceX did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,G7 leaders agree to lend Ukraine billions backed by Russia's frozen assets. Here's how it will work,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/g7-leaders-agree-lend-ukraine-billions-backed-russias-111081602,2024-06-13 03:34:26,"The leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival. WASHINGTON -- Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival that would use interest earned on profits from Russia’s frozen central bank assets as collateral. . Details of the deal were still being hashed out as G7 leaders gathered for a summit in Italy, but the money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year. That's according to a French official who confirmed the agreement Wednesday ahead of a formal announcement at the summit. Here's how the plan would work:. Most of the money would be provided in the form of a loan from the U.S. government that would be backed by windfall profits being earned on roughly $300 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of the money is being held in European Union nations.. A French official said that while the loan would be mostly U.S.-guaranteed, it could be “topped up” with European money or other national contributions. . That's much harder to do.. For more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.. The U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022 — basically, money being held in banks outside Russia. . The assets are immobilized and can’t be accessed by Moscow — but they still belong to Russia. . While governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court.. So the European Union instead has set aside the windfall profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access.. Separately, the U.S. earlier this year passed a law called the REPO Act — short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act — that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets located in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is still being worked out.. It will be up to technical experts to work through the details.. But U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday that the goal is “to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.”. Another goal is to get the money to Ukraine fast.. The French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out ""very quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.”. Beyond the costs of the war, the needs are great. The World Bank’s latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.. The move to unlock Russia's assets comes after there was a long delay by the U.S. Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine. . At an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said “the fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route.”. If Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds weren't generating enough interest to pay back the loan, ""then the question of burden-sharing arises,” according to the French official.. Who would shoulder the burden is still to be worked out, the official said.. Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that there were worries among European finance ministers that their countries “will be left holding the bag if Ukraine defaults.”. ___.

abcnews.com,Ukrainian winemakers visit California's Napa Valley to learn how to heal war-ravaged vineyards,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ukrainian-winemakers-visit-californias-napa-valley-learn-heal-111080943,2024-06-13 00:44:57,"A group of Ukrainian winemakers has visited California’s Napa Valley to learn about organic farming and how to heal land scarred by bombs and littered with mines. RUTHERFORD, Calif. -- As the head of an association of winemakers in southern Ukraine, Georgiy Molchanov knows a lot about how to cultivate grapes; not so much how to grow them amid undetonated mines.. But that was the situation he found himself in after a Russian rocket dropped the explosives on his vineyard near the port city of Mykolaiv in August 2022, six months after Russia invaded. The damage — and danger — the mines brought to his business marked one of the myriad catastrophic effects the more than 2-year-old war has had on the eastern European country. . Now, thanks to the combined efforts of the international nonprofit organization Roots of Peace, Rotary International, and the Grgich Hills Estate winery in Napa Valley, Molchanov is taking the steps he needs to reclaim and heal his wounded land. . First, Roots of Peace and Rotary International provided him with the expertise and supplies he needed to safely detonate the mines. Then, the groups teamed up to bring him and five other Ukrainian winemakers to Grgich Hills in Rutherford. During a weeklong stay here, they learned about regenerative organic farming, an agricultural method that prioritizes soil health and ecosystem balance.. “We are discussing how to bring nature, how to bring wines, not harm ... into this land,” said Molchanov, who heads the Association of Craft Winemakers in Ukraine’s Black Sea region. . He and his fellow entrepreneurs have another goal as well: to spread the message that, despite the ongoing war, the Ukrainian people remain resilient and look forward to life in peace.. “People in Ukraine are still alive,” said Svitlana Tsybak, Owner and CEO of Beykush Winery, also located in the Mykolaiv area. “Yes, war is in our soul, in our life, but we need ... to live our lives so, of course, we need to work.”. Tsybak said Russian troops are staked out about 4 miles (7 kilometers) from her vineyard but the war hasn’t directly affected her operations. Her winery started exporting wine to the United States six months ago. She said she wants to learn how to expand the presence of Ukrainian wine in the U.S. market.. Heidi Kuhn, a California peace activist who founded Roots of Peace, has worked for decades to remove landmines from war-ravaged land that she later helps to convert into vineyards, orchards and vegetable fields. Rotary International, which has collaborated for years with Roots of Peace, helped plan the program for the Ukrainian winemakers and funded their travel to California. . “There’s an estimated 110 million landmines in 60 countries, and today Ukraine tragically has over 30% of the land riddled with landmines,” said Kuhn, whose program is known as the “mines to vines” initiative.. In 2000, Kuhn worked with the founder of Grgich Hills Estate, the late Croatian immigrant Miljenko “Mike” Grgich, and other vintners to raise funds to clear landmines in Vukovar in eastern Croatia. The town, located in a winemaking region on the banks of the Danube, was reduced to rubble during the 1991-95 war in the former Yugoslavia.. Ivo Jeramaz, Grgich’s nephew, a native Croatian and a winemaker at Grgich Hills Estate, said he feels deeply for Ukrainians because he understands how heart-wrenching it is to live through war. He said the family winery has for decades helped Roots of Peace.. “This is just the beginning of a hopeful relationship to literally restore the health of this country,” he said. “I hope that not only they see how farming can be conducted without harmful chemicals, but also that they’re inspired and that their hope is elevated.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,G7 summit opens with deal to use Russian assets for Ukraine as EU's traditional powers recalibrate,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/g7-summit-opens-deal-russian-assets-ukraine-eus-111080577,2024-06-13 00:22:28,"A Group of Seven summit is opening in Italy with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral. BARI, Italy -- A Group of Seven summit is opening Thursday with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.. Diplomats confirmed that an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed in southern Italy for the three-day summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.. Beyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He’ll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.. The G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders — Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied — to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.. With Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.. The U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.. A French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen — say if the war ends — then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.. On the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine. . Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy’s first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.. The leaders of the G7’s two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.. As a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.. “While it’s unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially ‘Mediterranean Summit,” said Nick O’Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.. That includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.. Italy, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe’s migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.. Pope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.. He'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers “merchants of death.”. But Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.. The 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.. The G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that’s something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia’s medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.. Located next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.. No such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi’s port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.. As with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a “dinner for the poor” on Friday night calling for “peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.”. ___.

abcnews.com,"Ozy Media went from buzzy to belly-up. Its founder, Carlos Watson, is now on trial",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ozy-media-buzzy-belly-founder-carlos-watson-now-111080575,2024-06-13 00:22:18,"For nearly a decade, Ozy Media projected an image of new-media success. NEW YORK -- For nearly a decade, Ozy Media projected an image of new-media success.. The company boasted big-name interviews, an Emmy-winning TV show, a buzzy music and ideas festival and impressive numbers to show prospective investors — until it imploded in 2021 amid doubts about its audience size, viability and basic integrity.. Those doubts are now at the center of a federal criminal trial. Founder Carlos Watson and Ozy are fighting charges of conspiracy to commit fraud.. Even after numerous other public and court reckonings for Silicon Valley companies that went from ballyhooed to belly-up, it's hard to forget the moment in Ozy's downfall when co-founder Samir Rao impersonated a YouTube executive to talk up the company to prospective investors.. Watson's and Ozy's lawyers blame any misrepresentations solely on Rao, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and to identity theft. The defense also has claimed that prosecutors are casting commonplace entrepreneurial puffery as a crime and singling out Watson, a Black founder in a tech world where African American executives have been disproportionately few.. “I am not now and never have been a ‘con man,’” he declared when indicted last year.. Prosecutors and Rao, their star witness, say Ozy shredded the line between hopeful hype and bald-faced deceit.. “We told so many lies to so many different people,” Rao testified after recounting how a teetering company concocted rosy financials in a desperate bid to lure investors and stay in business.. The hope was to enable “a diverse audience, to consume, hopefully, a different, more meaningful kind of content,” he said. But “survival within the bonds of decency, fairness, truth, it morphed into survival at all costs and by any means necessary."". Ozy was founded in 2012 on a Millennial-friendly premise of providing a fresh, sophisticated-but-not-stuffy take on politics, culture and more — billed as “the new and the next” — while amplifying minority and marginalized voices.. A Harvard and Stanford-educated son of two South Florida teachers, Watson had worked on Wall Street, started and sold a test-prep company and anchored on MSNBC. He conceived of Ozy and then recruited Rao, a former finance-world colleague, after a chance meeting at a Chipotle restaurant in Silicon Valley, according to Rao.. Ozy debuted with a website, newsletters and a bang: Former President Bill Clinton was one of its first interviewees. The company expanded into podcasts, events and TV shows, winning a 2020 Emmy for the Watson-hosted “Black Women OWN the Conversation,” on the Oprah Winfrey Network. The annual Ozy Fest in New York's Central Park drew big names ranging from John Legend to a pre-presidency Joe Biden.. The company attracted a roster of major advertisers, clients and grants, according to testimony. But behind the scenes, prosecutors say, Ozy started bleeding money in 2018 and began trying to save itself with lies.. The company told a prospective investor it “finished 2017 with approximately 12 million in revenue” but gave its accountants a number under $7 million. The gaps widened with the years, yawning to as much as $53 million-vs.-$11 million for 2020, according to testimony and documents shown at trial.. Meanwhile, Ozy frequently delayed paying vendors and rent, borrowed against future receipts to get pricey cash advances and struggled to make payroll, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre testified.. The defense portrayed the cash scrambles as the growing pains of a successful startup.. ""Ozy Media did not defraud its investors or anyone else,” said the company's lawyer, Shannon Frison.. Watson lawyer and Harvard Law School Professor Ronald Sullivan Jr. said his client “believed every number that he gave every investor.” Sullivan suggested revenue figures could vary depending on whether they account for such “in-kind” income as trading ads with another outlet.. Poutre testified that auditors rarely agree to count such revenue and she did not feel Watson was always honest.. “I don’t know where his numbers came from. I know where my numbers came from,"" she said.. The alleged schemes went beyond questionable numbers.. While trying to get Ozy a bank loan in 2020, Rao faked a contract saying that Winfrey’s OWN network had renewed “Black Women OWN The Conversation” for a second season. When the bank wanted information directly from the network, Rao set up a phony email account for a real OWN executive and used it to offer the bank ""background on the transaction.”. Rao told jurors that Watson verbally approved the charade. Jurors saw a text message from Watson exhorting Rao to “be bold, get it done,” but the ”it"" wasn't specified. Ultimately, witnesses said, neither the loan nor the show renewal happened.. Rao's infamous phone call came the next year as Ozy sought an investment from Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs. He'd falsely claimed YouTube was paying for Watson's eponymous talk show. When Goldman bankers wanted confirmation, he downloaded a voice-modifying app and pretended to be a YouTube executive on a call with them.. But the bankers were wary, the real YouTube exec soon found out and Watson told Goldman Sachs and Ozy's board that his co-founder had suffered a mental breakdown.. The investment didn’t materialize, but Goldman Sachs continued advertising with Ozy after the episode, Rao said.. Rao told jurors he was taking antidepressants but was not having a psychiatric crisis when he made the call. Watson was present and coaching him via text message, Rao said.. “I am a big fan of Carlos, Samir and the show,” reads one text, which Rao explained as Watson feeding him a line for his phony persona to say. Then Watson urged, “use the right pronouns. You are NOT OZY,” among other messages.. Watson’s lawyer said the Ozy founder stumbled upon Rao’s deceit midstream, was appalled and signaled him to hang up.. The defense has emphasized that Rao drafted a 2021 letter — ultimately unsent — saying the phone ruse was his alone. Rao told jurors he wrote it to protect the company.. Defense lawyers have cast him as an incompetent executive, confessed fabricator and admitted criminal who's falsely implicating Watson in hopes of avoiding prison for his own crimes.. “So, Mr. Rao, you're a liar, right?” Sullivan asked during cross-examination last Friday.. “Regrettably,"" Rao replied, “I've told many lies in my time at Ozy.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A widespread power outage hit Puerto Rico Wednesday night, leaving more than 340,000 customers without electricity after two of the U.S. territory’s power plants shut down.. The capital of San Juan was left without power, as well as neighboring municipalities including Bayamón, Caguas and Carolina.. Luma Energy, which operates transmission and distribution for Puerto Rico’s power authority, said on X that the outage was tied to an issue with the power plants’ transmission lines. It provided a statement to The Associated Press saying it was investigating the outage that coincided with the shutdown of units operated by Genera PR, which operates and maintains state power generation units.. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi condemned the outage and said he was demanding answers and solutions from Luma and Genera PR.. “The events that have been occurring in recent weeks with our electrical system are unacceptable,” he posted on X. “While it is true that we have old plants and transmission lines in terrible condition, the people continue to suffer the consequences of the lack of sense of urgency that private operators are demonstrating.”. Both Luma and Genera PR were selected as private operators under Pierluisi's administration.. The outage is the most recent in a string of blackouts to hit Puerto Rico, which is still trying to rebuild the grid after Hurricane Maria razed it in 2017 as a Category 4 storm.. The outage prompted the mayor of the San Juan capital, Miguel Romero, to declare a state of emergency late Wednesday as he accused Luma of sharing limited information about the ongoing blackouts.. “There are thousands of children with specific feeding needs, as well as older adults who often need therapy machines to protect their health and often save their lives,” the decree stated.. Scores of Puerto Ricans took to social media to condemn the most recent outage and demand the ouster of Luma, noting that it occurred amid excessive heat warnings. Not all on the island of 3.2 million people with a poverty rate of more than 40% can afford generators or solar panels.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,DeSantis appointees bury the hatchet with Disney by approving new development deal,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/desantis-appointees-bury-hatchet-disney-approving-new-development-111077853,2024-06-12 21:34:32,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees have given final approval to an agreement that buries the hatchet between Disney and the governing district for Walt Disney World. ORLANDO, Fla. -- Gov. Ron DeSantis' appointees on Wednesday gave final approval to an agreement that buries the hatchet between Disney and the governing district for Walt Disney World, which the Florida governor took over after the company two years ago publicly opposed a state law critics dubbed “Don't Say Gay.”. The five DeSantis-appointed board members to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District unanimously voted to approve a 15-year development deal in which the district committed to making infrastructure improvements in exchange for Disney investing up to $17 billion into Disney World over the next two decades.. The agreement followed a detente in March in which both sides agreed to stop litigating each other in state court and work towards negotiating a new development agreement and a new comprehensive plan no later than next year. The district provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, among other things, and was controlled by Disney supporters before the takeover by the DeSantis appointees.. District board member Brian Aungst said at Wednesday night's board meeting that the agreement provides a lasting and stable framework for Disney and the board to work together.. “This is the day we all have been looking forward to,” Aungst said. “I was always extremely optimistic and knew we would get here because it was the right outcome.”. Under the deal, Disney will be required to donate up to 100 acres (40 hectares) of Disney World’s 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) for the construction of infrastructure projects controlled by the district. The company also will need to award at least half of its construction projects to companies based in Florida and spend at least $10 million on affordable housing for central Florida.. Disney would then be approved to build a fifth major theme park at Disney World and two more minor parks, such as water parks, if it desired. The company could raise the number of hotel rooms on its property from almost 40,000 rooms to more than 53,000 rooms and increase the amount of retail and restaurant space by more than 20%. Disney will retain control of building heights due to its need to maintain an immersive environment.. Leaders of Orlando's tourism industry praised the agreement, telling the district's board members that it will bring boundless jobs, tourists and attention to central Florida.. “It very clearly demonstrates to the world that the district and Disney are eager to resume working together for the great state of Florida,” said Robert Earl, founder and CEO of Planet Hollywood International, Inc.. Still up in the air was an appeal of a federal lawsuit Disney had filed against DeSantis and his appointees. After the settlement was reached in March, Disney asked the appellate court to put that case on hold while the development agreement was negotiated. The company has until next week to file a brief with the court if it wants to move ahead with the case.. Disney didn't respond to an email Wednesday afternoon seeking comment on how the company planned to proceed. The DeSantis appointees to the district had planned to hold a closed-door discussion about the lawsuit after their board meeting Wednesday but cancelled that meeting.. Matthew Oberly, a spokesperson for the district, said Wednesday night that the district didn't have any comment on the future of the federal litigation. . The March settlement ended almost two years of litigation sparked by DeSantis’ takeover of the district following the company’s opposition to the 2022 law that bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by the Republican governor, who used Disney as a punching bag in speeches during his run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination until he suspended his campaign earlier this year.. As punishment for Disney’s opposition to the controversial law, DeSantis took over the governing district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors. Disney sued DeSantis and his appointees, claiming the company’s free speech rights were violated for speaking out against the legislation. A federal judge dismissed that lawsuit in January, but Disney appealed.. Before control of the district changed hands early last year, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with the company shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees claimed the “eleventh-hour deals” neutered their powers, and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided.. Disney filed counterclaims that included asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable. Those state court lawsuits were dismissed as part of the March settlement.. ___.

abcnews.com,"China's Premier Li is visiting New Zealand, where security fears vie with trade hopes on the agenda",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/chinas-premier-li-visiting-new-zealand-security-fears-111077560,2024-06-12 23:10:18,"China's Premier Li Qiang has arrived in New Zealand at the start of a weeklong tour that also includes Australia and Malaysia. WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- China’s Premier Li Qiang arrived in New Zealand on Thursday, beginning a rare visit to its closest partner among Western democracies, where a celebration of trade links is expected to vie with concerns about South Pacific security on Wellington's agenda. . China’s No. 2 official, Li is the first Chinese premier to visit New Zealand since a 2017 visit by Li Keqiang. He will also visit Australia and Malaysia, China's Foreign Ministry said this week. The trip coincides with easing tensions between Australia and China that have vexed the relationship in recent years. . New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is expected to salute trade links with China in public statements this week. China is the South Pacific nation's largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth 36 billion New Zealand dollars ($22 billion). They signed a bilateral free trade agreement in 2008 — China's first with an Organization for Cooperation and Development nation — and the visit marks the 10th anniversary of a pledge to bolster ties signed in 2014 when China's President Xi Jinping last visited Wellington.. But while Luxon hailed the visit in remarks to reporters on Monday as presenting renewed opportunities for business, Wellington has long sought to diversify the country's export market away from dependence on China and the visit will not be a simple story of economic success as engagements with New Zealand leaders have sometimes been before. . As China and the U.S. vie for influence in the Pacific, Luxon spoke ahead of a tour of Niue and Fiji this month of “increasingly choppy geostrategic waters” for the region, although he stopped short of naming China except as one of a list of countries jockeying for sway. . New Zealand has in recent years taken a less assertive line with Beijing on security matters than its Western partners in the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership and has sought a consistent foreign policy approach to Beijing that spans political parties and administrations. But Luxon told reporters Monday that there were areas where, in talks with Li, Wellington would “call out our differences and discuss those openly, too.”. One point of friction is likely to be New Zealand's contemplation of joining one tranche of the AUKUS security pact among Australia, the United States and Britain. . “We happen to think AUKUS is good from a security point of view, providing security into the Indo-Pacific,” Luxon said, calling it appropriate that New Zealand explores its options under the agreement before deciding whether to participate.. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi decried New Zealand and Australia's security concerns in meetings with his New Zealand counterpart during a visit to Wellington in March. . “They're real,” Luxon said of regional threats. . On Thursday, more than 100 people held banners and Chinese and New Zealand flags aloft as they lined a side street near the airport in chilly, overcast conditions to watch Li's Air China flight arrive — an unusual sight in the capital, Wellington, population 215,000, which is absent from many international air routes. . The normally sleepy beachside suburb of Lyall Bay had a bolstered presence of law enforcement officers. As Li's motorcade emerged from the airport, drumming, chanting and singing from those assembled greeted the leader, prompting questions from bemused retail workers arriving to open nearby stores. . Li on Saturday will head to Australia's capital, where Beijing's relations in recent years have not been as smooth.. His visit to Canberra caps two years of efforts to rebuild China-Australia relations after a period of intense hostility and celebrates what both sides hope is a sustainable return to normalcy in ties, despite their differences on regional security and human rights.. His visit, the first by a Chinese premier in seven years, follows Albanese’s trip to Beijing last November and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s trip to Australia and New Zealand in March. China has been steadily rolling back tariffs and other restrictions it placed on imports from Australia as relations soured in 2020.. China is opposed to Australia’s plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines with assistance from the U.S. and the U.K., which it sees as part of American efforts to constrain China by deepening military ties with other countries in the region.. But with Australia is unlikely to bend on that issue, Li’s focus will likely be on moving past their differences and deepening economic ties. Australia, which has a trade surplus with China, is a major supplier of iron ore and other minerals to the world’s second largest economy.. ___.

abcnews.com,Democrats in Congress say federal mediators should let airline workers strike when it's 'necessary',https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/democrats-congress-federal-mediators-airline-workers-strike-111074765,2024-06-12 19:17:59,"Union flight attendants are getting help from some members of Congress as they try to negotiate new labor contracts. A group of 32 senators say federal mediators should speed up labor negotiations between airlines and their flight attendants and other workers, even granting them permission to go on strike “as necessary.”. The lawmakers said Wednesday that airlines feel no pressure to reach contract agreements quickly because federal law makes it difficult for airline workers to strike. That causes talks to drag on for years, they said.. The senators — 31 Democrats and independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont — joined House Democrats by weighing in while flight attendants at American Airlines and United Airlines are trying to gain more leverage at the bargaining table.. Before they can legally strike, airline workers need permission from the National Mediation Board, which must determine that more negotiations are hopeless. The board has already turned down a request by American's flight attendants. . The lawmakers complained in a letter to the board that without new contracts, airline employees can go years without a raise, “while airline carriers make record-breaking profits.” They asked the board to use all its powers, including granting permission to strike “as necessary,” to settle long-running negotiations.. The senators said the ability to strike is a fundamental right that has helped workers in other industries win “groundbreaking new contracts in recent years.”. Flight attendants at American, United and other airlines have tried strike-authorization votes and picketing at airports to put pressure on the carriers. The workers are frustrated that they haven't been able to win the large wage increases that pilots at Delta, United, American and Southwest have received under contracts approved since the start of last year.. The mediation board has not permitted an airline strike since 2010, when Spirit Airlines pilots conducted a brief walkout. Even with mediators’ permission, strikes can be delayed or blocked by the president and Congress. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,"NYC considers ending broker fees for tenants, angering real estate industry",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/nyc-considers-ending-broker-fees-tenants-angering-real-111074444,2024-06-12 19:02:26,"A proposal seeking to eliminate a hefty price tag for New York City renters is drawing fierce opposition from the real estate industry. NEW YORK -- It’s a familiar and agonizing experience for legions of New York City renters: before moving into a new apartment, a tenant must first shell out thousands of dollars in fees to a real estate broker, even if that person was hired by the landlord. . The hefty one-time payments, known as broker fees, are ubiquitous in New York but nearly unheard of anywhere else. In most other cities, landlords cover the commission of agents working on their behalf. . But legislation backed by a majority of the New York City Council would require landlords who hire brokers to pay their fees, marking a potential sea change in one of the country’s most expensive housing markets. . Renters, who make up more than two-thirds of city households, are hailing the latest attempt at reform. At a hearing Wednesday, many New Yorkers recalled paying exorbitant fees to brokers who appeared to do little more than open a door to an apartment or direct them to a lockbox.. “In most businesses, the person who hires the person pays the person,” said Agustina Velez, a house cleaner from Queens who said she recently paid $6,000 to switch apartments. “Enough with these injustices. Landlords have to pay for the services they use.”. But the proposal has triggered fierce opposition from New York's real estate industry. . Ahead of the hearing, hundreds of brokers gathered to voice their objections at a rally organized by the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry’s powerful lobbying group. . Through hours of testimony, they warned the legislation would sow chaos in the rental market and decimate the livelihoods of the city’s roughly 25,000 real estate agents. Many predicted landlords would pass on the costs of paying brokers to tenants through increased rents or keep apartments off the market altogether. . “This is the start of a top-down government-controlled housing system,” said Jordan Silver, a broker with the firm Brown Harris Stevens. “The language is so incredibly vague we actually have no idea what this would look like in the world.”. The bill’s sponsor, City Councilman Chi Ossé, has said he was moved to act following a recent apartment search that was “tiring, treacherous, and competitive.” Another local official, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, testified that he’d once paid a $2,500 fee to a broker he never met.. Their frustration was echoed at Wednesday’s hearing by dozens of ordinary renters, along with a mix of labor unions, housing policy groups and some prominent business leaders. Critics said paying brokers' fees serves as a barrier to those who’d otherwise move to the city while preventing low-income New Yorkers from relocating to new homes.. Such broker fees were previously banned in 2020 under a package of renter protection laws passed by the state. But they were quickly reinstated following a lawsuit led by the Real Estate Board of New York. . Brokerage firms estimate that roughly half of the city’s apartments require a tenant-paid broker fee. The price of those fees can vary widely, though the standard amount is 15% of the annual rent. For the average apartment in Manhattan, where the median monthly rent recently hit $4,500, that would amount to a fee of $8,100. . Under the legislation, tenants would still pay brokers that they hired directly. The bill’s brief language — less than 200 words — only requires the party that hires the real estate agent pay their fee. . “How the market works is not as simple as a few sentences, which is what the bill is,” said Ryan Monell, a vice president at the Real Estate Board of New York. “It’s a misnomer to compare New York to other cities. This is really an exceptional market.”. Brokers are adamant that their jobs are far more intensive than merely opening the door to tenants. Many said they help put together listings, review applications, answer questions posed by tenants and arrange tours at all hours of the day. But some also acknowledged that the current system favors landlords. . “I think it’s not logical. The landlord should pay the listing agent who is working on their behalf,” said Maria Octavio, a real estate broker with the firm of Douglas Elliman. “Because it’s worked this way for many years, the owners are used to it.”. Anna Klenkar, a broker at Sotheby’s, said the industry group — known as REBNY — had contacted her employer after learning that she planned to testify Wednesday in support of the legislation. “It feels less like we’re protecting ourselves, and more like we’re protecting landlords, whom REBNY also represents,” she testified. . A spokesperson for REBNY did not respond to an emailed inquiry about whether they had reached out to the employer. . Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, warned the bill could have unintended consequences.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The sheriff of a rural Tennessee county illegally profited from the work of jail inmates under his supervision and housed dozens of them in a home outside of the prison without permission, officials said Wednesday.. Gibson County Sheriff Paul Thomas was indicted in May in Gibson and Davidson counties on 22 charges including official misconduct, theft, forgery and computer crimes involving jail inmates in his custody, Tennessee Comptroller Jason Mumpower said in a news release.. Thomas turned himself in to authorities this week and he is out on bond, said Davidson County district attorney Stacey Edmonson. Thomas' lawyer said the sheriff deserves the presumption of innocence and he looks forward to defending himself in court. . Investigators said Thomas was an investor in three for-profit companies that provided staffing assistance to local businesses, housed current and former inmates in a transitional home, and provided transportation to work-release inmates and former inmates traveling to and from work. Thomas failed to disclose his ownership interest in the companies, known as Alliance Group, in his annual filings with the Tennessee Ethics Commission, Mumpower said. . Thomas directed more than $1.4 million in inmate wage fees and deductions to profit Alliance Group, investigators said. At least 170 inmates in Thomas’ custody were employed by Alliance's staffing agency during the investigation, investigators said.. Alliance Transportation was paid $18 per day to bring inmates to and from work, while 82 inmates were allowed, without proper approval, to live at Orchard House transitional home instead of the Gibson County jail, investigators said, noting that they were charged $40 per day by the home,. He received more than $181,000 in compensation, payroll benefits, and legal representation services from Alliance — money that was illegally derived from inmate labor, the comptroller's office said.. Investigators said Thomas also deceived the Tennessee Department of Correction by showing the county jail as the inmate location in the state’s offender management system rather than the transitional home, resulting in the county collecting more than $500,000 in reimbursements from the state. . Thomas then required the county to give that money to Orchard House without the correction department's knowledge or consent. . “Orchard House was neither attached to the jail nor staffed by jail personnel, and no contract existed between the county and Orchard House,” the comptroller's office said.. William Massey, Thomas' lawyer, said the indictment “has caused a flurry of activity in the press, but it has no evidentiary weight or value.” . “He looks forward to his day in court before 12 jurors when he can defend himself, and his defense team does too,” Massey said in an email to The Associated Press.. The AP in May released a series of stories related to U.S. prison labor.. Gibson County is located northwest of Memphis. Thomas' indictment comes more than seven years after another Gibson County sheriff, Chuck Arnold, pleaded guilty to charges including fraud, theft, forgery and official misconduct related to the taking of drugs and money from a jail medication fund. . Arnold was sentenced to probation.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

X is now hiding which posts you like from other users,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/happened-likes-now-hiding-posts-users-111073439,2024-06-12 17:50:19,"Social media platform X is now hiding your likes. NEW YORK -- Social media platform X is now hiding your likes.. In an update posted on the platform formerly known as Twitter earlier this week, X's engineering team said it would be “making Likes private for everyone to better protect your privacy."" That means that users will still be able to see their own likes, but others will not — putting an end to a feature that many had long used.. The change went into effect Wednesday. As of the afternoon, the “Likes” tab appeared to only be available on users' own profile page. But when visiting other accounts, that tab is no longer available. . Users also received a pop-up notification that seemed to suggest the change would result in more user engagement.. “Liking more posts will make your ‘For you’ feed better,” the message read.. According to the engineering team's update, like counts and other metrics for a user's own posts will still show up under notifications. Posts still appear to show how many likes they have — but the author will be the only person who can see a list of those who liked it.. The option to hide likes was previously just available to paying Premium subscribers. When X announced that option in September, it said users could “keep spicy likes private by hiding your likes tab.”. The hidden like count is one of many changes that have come to the platform since billionaire Elon Musk purchased it for $44 billion in 2022. Beyond a new name and logo, other changes include doing away with the once-coveted blue checks for non-Premium users — and then restoring them to some.. The in-app changes have seen mixed receptions on the platform. In the early days of X stripping the verification badges from prominent officials and news organizations, for example, many voiced misinformation concerns. The platform has also faced both rising user and advertiser pushback amid ongoing concerns about content moderation and hate speech on the San Francisco-based platform, which some researchers say has been on the rise under Musk.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C.

Sony Pictures Entertainment is getting into the exhibition business. The studio behind recent films like “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” and “The Garfield Movie” has acquired the distinctive theater chain Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, the companies said Wednesday. Included in the deal is the genre film festival Fantastic Fest.. Sony said it will continue to welcome content from all studios and distributors at the dine-in theaters. . Alamo Drafthouse was founded in 1997 as a single screen, family-owned repertory theater in Austin, Texas, and has grown to 35 locations in North America. It distinguished itself in the exhibition landscape with drinks, dine-in food service and a cool vibe that became a favorite of cinephiles. . “We are beyond thrilled to join forces with Sony Pictures Entertainment to expand our company vision to be the best damn cinema that has ever, or will ever, exist now in ways we could only ever dream of,” Alamo Drafthouse founder Tim League said in a statement. “They have a deep respect and understanding of cinema’s ability to both drive growth and create lasting cultural impact which aligns perfectly with everything Alamo Drafthouse stands for.”. For Sony, the Drafthouse acquisition is also tied into its experiences initiatives, including its Wheel of Fortune Live! Traveling tour and the Wonderverse space in Chicago. Ravi Ahuja, the president and chief operating officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment, also noted that the studio’s Crunchyroll films are particularly aligned with the interests of Drafthouse fans.. Alamo Drafthouse has seen its ups and downs over the years. In March 2021, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, closed some locations and canceled plans to open new ones. Alamo emerged from bankruptcy at the end of May 2021, under the ownership of League, Altamont Capital Partners and Fortress Investment Group. Michael Kusterman, a former executive at Caveman Foods, was named Alamo CEO. He will remain, heading the newly established Sony Pictures Experiences division and reporting to Ahuja, the statement said.. Last year following the frenzy of Barbenheimer, employees at the Alamo Drafthouse in Manhattan and Brooklyn voted to unionize. Similar efforts were attempted at locations in San Francisco and Austin and were met with resistance from the leadership.. For many years, Hollywood studios could not run movie theaters and control what was played on those screens following a landmark antitrust Supreme Court case in 1948 that outlawed practices like “block booking,” in which studios required theaters to book a bundle of their films. Each of the major studios entered into a consent decree with the Department of Justice, known as the Paramount Consent Decrees, which required the major studios that owned theaters at the time to either divest distribution operations or their theaters.. Conflicts between Hollywood studio business practices and the federal government go back to the early 1920s, over concerns about vertical integration and the monopolization of film production and distribution. In the 1930s and 1940s, most first-run movie theaters had only one screen. . Distribution and exhibition have undergone vast changes since the days of the Paramount Consent Decrees, including the proliferation of multiplex theaters that show films from different exhibitors throughout the day and the advent of television, home video and streaming. The separation mandate officially went away in 2020 when the Paramount Consent Decrees were terminated. . Now Netflix, for instance, owns several theaters in New York and Los Angeles, and the Walt Disney Co., which was not part of the original “big eight” in the 1940s, owns and operates the El Capitan in Los Angeles. Movie theater chains have also stepped outside their lane recently, with artists like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé partnering directly with AMC Theaters to distribute their concert films.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

DALLAS -- The CEO of Southwest Airlines said Wednesday he will not resign in the face of pressure from a hedge fund that wants him fired and that his leadership team will produce its own plan to boost the airline's financial performance.. CEO Robert Jordan said Southwest will present its plan in September. He declined to give specifics, but again hinted that it could include changes in the airline’s longstanding boarding and seating policies.. Elliott Investment Management notified Southwest’s board Monday that it bought a $1.9 billion stake in the Dallas-based company and is seeking to replace Jordan and Gary Kelly, the airline’s chairman and former CEO, with executives from outside the company.. Elliott accused Southwest leadership of failing to change with evolving customer tastes, causing it to lag behind rivals. The hedge fund noted that Southwest’s share price has fallen more than 50% over the past three years.. Another investment manager, Artisan Partners, said Wednesday that it has raised the same issues with Southwest, and it urged the airline's board of directors to “upgrade the company's leadership.”. Speaking to reporters after a Politico event in Washington, Jordan said, “I have no plans to resign"" and that Southwest will treat Elliott “like any other investor.”. “Elliott can provide us ideas. They can talk to other shareholders, but Elliott is not directing the company,” he said. . Jordan said Southwest is investing in better technology — critics blamed outdated systems for contributing to massive flight cancellations in December 2022. He said the airline is also improving the customer experience with better WiFi, larger bins for carry-on bags, and more power outlets. . Southwest is also considering changes to its cabin and seating, such as whether to sell some seats with extra legroom, Jordan said. . “We've got an investor day in September, and I'm eager to lay out a very broad plan for how we improve the company both from a customer perspective but from a financial perspective,” Jordan said. He added that an Elliott presentation aimed at Southwest shareholders was “fairly light” on ideas.. Elliott, whose stake in Southwest is estimated by analysts to be around 11%, declined to comment on the CEO's remarks.. Artisan Partners, which holds 1.8% of Southwest stock, according to FactSet, said Wednesday that it has made the same points as Elliott about the need for “dramatic change” to Kelly, the airline's chairman, in the past several months.. Two Artisan executives said in a letter to Southwest’s board that they were writing “to urge the board to reconstitute itself and upgrade the company's leadership. ...

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Food authorities in Denmark have recalled three types of spicy instant noodle products imported from South Korea over possible risks for “acute poisoning.” Consumers are asked to discard them or return the noodles to the retailer.. The noodles are made by Seoul-based Samyang Foods, one of South Korea’s largest companies, and sold across the globe. The recalled noodles include Buldak Samyang 3 x Spicy & Hot Chicken, Buldak Samyang 2 x Spicy & Hot Chicken and Buldak Samyang Hot Chicken Stew. . The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said the products contain an overly high dose of capsaicin, an active ingredient in chile peppers but also a chemical that can be a neurotoxin and a health hazard.. Children and teenagers in Denmark have been daring each other on social media to eat “a strong bowl of noodle soup,” referring to the three South Korean products, the agency said. . “The noodle dishes marketed as extremely strong must no longer be sold because consumers and especially children risk acute poisoning,” it said late Tuesday. ""The capsaicin content is so high that it can pose a health hazard.”. Children and frail adults and the elderly are at risk, said Henrik Dammand Nielsen of the Danish Food and Drug Administration. Possibly symptoms include burning and discomfort, nausea, vomiting and high blood pressure, he said.. “That is why we are now demanding shops remove the products from their shelves,” the agency said.. In a statement to reporters, Samyang said it understands that the steps taken in Denmark were not based on product quality issues but because local authorities thought “they were too spicy and could potentially cause problems.”. The company said the same noodles are exported worldwide but it was the first time they were ordered to recall them in any market.. “We will closely study local regulations while responding to this recall measure,” the company said.. Spicy food challenges have been around for years. From local chile pepper eating contests to restaurant walls of fame for those who finished extra hot dishes, people around the world have been daring each other to eat especially fiery foods.. In September, a Massachusetts teen with a congenital heart defect who participated in a spicy tortilla chip challenge on social media died from eating a large quantity of chile pepper extract. An autopsy report obtained by The Associated Press showed that the 10th grader died on Sept. 1, 2023, after eating the Paqui chip as part of the manufacturer’s “One Chip Challenge.” . In Denmark, a puzzled consumer reached out to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration and asked how the instant noodles could be legal, the agency said, after which it had a lab assessing the products and determined the three noodle brands can be harmful to health, instigating the recall.. ""It is important that parents are aware of the extreme noodle varieties and avoid them, Dammand Nielsen said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

More than ever, buying a hybrid vehicle makes a lot of sense. The latest models are just as powerful — in some cases, more powerful — as related gas-only models and have such small price premiums that it’s easy to start saving money while reducing your vehicle-based carbon emissions. But what to choose, especially when you’re on a tight budget? Consider a hybrid sedan. Compared to an SUV, they typically get better mileage and have a lower starting price. Edmunds’ experts highlight six of the top new hybrid sedans on sale today for under $35,000. They are ordered below by price including the destination charge. . Looking for great value? The 2024 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid has the lowest price tag in this category while also piling on a five-year/60,000-mile basic, 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. Toyota and Honda can’t beat that. This hybrid version of Hyundai’s small sedan also boasts up to an EPA-estimated 54 mpg combined and comes nicely equipped with many helpful technology features. The main drawback is a lack of power: The 139-horsepower hybrid engine makes passing or accelerating up to highway speeds a bit belabored. . Base starting price: $27,400. The 2024 Toyota Prius is Edmunds’ top-rated hybrid sedan for good reason. Easily identified by its sleek new profile, the latest Prius gets up to an EPA-estimated 57 mpg combined. It’s also a lot more powerful than the Elantra Hybrid — it makes up to 196 horsepower — and can be equipped with all-wheel drive to help enhance traction in wintery weather conditions. The Prius has a hatchback-style trunk that makes loading cargo easy. However, the actual cargo area is a little small, and the Prius’ rear seat isn’t as roomy as the Elantra’s. . Base starting price: $29,045. Numerically tied on Edmunds’ list of best hybrid sedans is the 2025 Toyota Camry. The Camry is fully redesigned this year and comes with a hybrid powertrain as standard. That means every Camry is now a Camry hybrid. It gets up to 52 mpg and still has all of the qualities you expect of a Camry, including roomy seating and a no-nonsense driving demeanor. All-wheel drive is available too. Some drivers might find seat comfort a bit lacking, but overall the Camry is an excellent choice. . Base starting price: $29,495. Spacious and sleek, the 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is refreshed for this model year. Hyundai bestowed its midsize sedan with a full-width headlight bar that gives the Sonata Hybrid a stylish look. Under the hood is a hybrid powertrain that gets up to 47 mpg combined. All-wheel drive isn’t available, however, and acceleration isn’t quite as snappy as the Camry’s. Inside, you’ll find a big center touchscreen that’s easy to use along with many standard features. And as with the Elantra, the Sonata is backed by a long warranty. . Base starting price: $31,950. The 2024 Honda Accord is a jack-of-all-trades sedan that is as at home ferrying kids to soccer practice as it is transporting a single professional around town. Ever since the Accord’s last redesign, Honda has made the hybrid powertrain standard on the Accord’s more expensive trim levels. That results in a higher starting price than the Camry or Sonata, though you do get a well-equipped Accord in the process. EPA-estimated fuel economy is up to 48 mpg combined, and the Accord is the quickest-accelerating hybrid sedan on our list. All-wheel drive isn’t available.. Base starting price: $33,990. Hold the phone, because Honda is making a hybrid powertrain available in the 2025 Civic. It will come with the same hybrid powertrain as the Accord and will get up to 50 mpg combined. You’ll also be able to get the hybrid in the Civic sedan or the Civic hatchback. But similar to the Accord, Honda will only equip the Civic’s top trim levels with the hybrid. The 2025 Civic should be arriving at dealerships this month.. Base starting price: $29,845. Each of these sedans gets excellent fuel efficiency and comes well equipped with features. The Prius continues to be the best choice for maximum mpg, but the other cars aren’t far behind and offer more interior space.. ____________.

Author Michael Brodeur takes the gym too seriously, and not seriously at all at the same time, in his book “Swole: The Making of Men and the Meaning of Muscles” in an effort to show the readers that the overly online world of hypermasculinity is an illusion and what a man can be is what you make of it. . Brodeur evokes his own autobiography to guide the reader through the history of weightlifting and the role of men in society. He's a middle-aged, Gen-X, self-described “meathead” who brags about the depths of his squats and size of his biceps and butt, but also lives a life as the classical music critic for The Washington Post and a gay man. . These dueling identities weave through Brodeur's “Swole."" The narrative works, most of the time, but sometimes Brodeur's chapters feel more like miniature essays surrounding a broader theme of masculinity than a comprehensive whole. . He celebrates male bodies and men wanting to be bigger, stronger, and uses humor and the history of idols like Arnold Schwarzenegger, He-Man, and professional wrestling to show how men's identities have evolved and changed since he was a child struggling to come to terms with his own sexual orientation. . Brodeur appears to reject the modern-day gym industry that often sells their version of the ideal body: A place where calorie counts are perfected, macronutrients are measured and microtargeting of muscle groups are a must. . Instead, Brodeur tells the reader to reach for the ideal you want — be comfortable looking at yourself in a mirror, and know it's also OK to be somewhat embarrassed about looking at yourself in a mirror. . Brodeur also warns about the rising influence that internet personalities like Andrew Tate or the Liver King are having on younger men, or the unending number of TikTok personalities that basically lay out easy ways for young men to purchase and abuse anabolic steroids. . “Adrift and allegedly emasculated by the mass rejection of ‘real masculinity,’” men are now balls-deep in an imaginary internet-based civil war with themselves,” he writes.. “Swole” allows men to celebrate masculinity as they want to define it. . ___.

LOS ANGELES -- After organizers for Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July hot dog-eating contest said Joey Chestnut wouldn’t compete this year because of a deal with a rival brand, Netflix swiftly announced a new hot dog-eating competition that will feature Chestnut and his “fiercest rival.”. Chestnut, a 16-time hot dog-eating champion, will face off with his frequent Nathan’s competitor, Takeru Kobayashi, in a live Netflix special on Sept. 2, the streamer announced Wednesday. . The contest, titled “Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef,” will feature the two chowing down on all-beef hot dogs, likely in a nod to reports that Chestnut’s rival brand deal is with Impossible Foods, which makes plant-based hot dogs.. Major League Eating, the organization that oversees the Nathan’s contest, announced Tuesday that Chestnut’s deal was an “exclusivity” issue, saying that it was his decision to step back from the competition he has participated in since 2005. “We love him. The fans love him,” said George Shea, a Major League Eating event organizer, adding: “He made the choice.”. Chestnut disputed that he made the choice, saying on the social platform X that Nathan’s and Major League Eating made the decision, adding that it would “deprive fans of the holiday’s usual joy and entertainment.”. He also wrote that fans could “rest assured” that they would see him east again soon, adding: “STAY HUNGRY!”. Impossible Foods has not confirmed a formal relationship with Chestnut, but he said in a statement on Tuesday they support his choice to compete in any competition, adding “Meat eaters shouldn’t have to be exclusive to just one wiener.”. Following Netflix’s announcement, Shea said the streamer was “trying to recreate the Nathan’s contest to some extent and you just can’t do that.”. “Imitation is the best form of flattery,” he added. . New York City Mayor Eric Adams joined the conversation via X on Wednesday, urging Nathan's and Major League Eating to “stop being such weenies.” “It would be ‘impossible’ to have this year's Nathan's Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest without Joey Chestnut,” he wrote. “Let's find a way to squash this beef and bring back the champ for another 4th of July at Coney Island!”. In a Netflix news release announcing the competition, Chestnut said he was eager bring the competition to the streaming service.. “Through all of my years in competitive eating, Kobayashi stands out as my fiercest rival,” Chestnut said via the release. “Competing against him pushed me to be so much better. I know that fans have waited a long time for another chapter of our rivalry and I can’t wait for our massive showdown live on Netflix! It’s time to give the people what they want!”. Kobayashi, who has been rumored to be retired, said in the Netflix release that he is looking forward to facing off with Chestnut once more. The two have not competed since 2009.. “Retiring for me will only happen after I take him down one last time,” Kobayashi said. “This rivalry has been brewing for a long time. Competing against Joey live on Netflix means fans all over the world can watch me knock him out.”. The hot dog-eating competition is the latest of the streamer's recent efforts to expand into live TV, and it highlights the company's emphasis on sporting events, which will include Christmas Day NFL games starting this year and WWE's “Raw” in 2025. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

X is now hiding which posts you like from other users,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/happened-likes-now-hiding-posts-users-111073441,2024-06-12 17:50:20,"Social media platform X is now hiding your likes. NEW YORK -- Social media platform X is now hiding your likes.. In an update posted on the platform formerly known as Twitter earlier this week, X's engineering team said it would be “making Likes private for everyone to better protect your privacy."" That means that users will still be able to see their own likes, but others will not — putting an end to a feature that many had long used.. The change went into effect Wednesday. As of the afternoon, the “Likes” tab appeared to only be available on users' own profile page. But when visiting other accounts, that tab is no longer available. . Users also received a pop-up notification that seemed to suggest the change would result in more user engagement.. “Liking more posts will make your ‘For you’ feed better,” the message read.. According to the engineering team's update, like counts and other metrics for a user's own posts will still show up under notifications. Posts still appear to show how many likes they have — but the author will be the only person who can see a list of those who liked it.. The option to hide likes was previously just available to paying Premium subscribers. When X announced that option in September, it said users could “keep spicy likes private by hiding your likes tab.”. The hidden like count is one of many changes that have come to the platform since billionaire Elon Musk purchased it for $44 billion in 2022. Beyond a new name and logo, other changes include doing away with the once-coveted blue checks for non-Premium users — and then restoring them to some.. The in-app changes have seen mixed receptions on the platform. In the early days of X stripping the verification badges from prominent officials and news organizations, for example, many voiced misinformation concerns. The platform has also faced both rising user and advertiser pushback amid ongoing concerns about content moderation and hate speech on the San Francisco-based platform, which some researchers say has been on the rise under Musk.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Wreck of the last ship of famed Anglo-Irish explorer Shackleton found off the coast of Canada,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/wreck-ship-belonging-famed-irish-explorer-found-off-111060392,2024-06-12 22:06:35,"The wreck of the last ship belonging to a famous Irish-born British explorer of Antarctica has been found off the coast of Canada by an international team led by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland -- The wreck of the last ship belonging to Sir Ernest Shackleton, a famous Irish-born British explorer of Antarctica, has been found off the coast of Labrador in Canada, 62 years after it went missing. The wreck was found by an international team led by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.. The Quest was found using sonar scans on Sunday evening, sitting on its keel under 390 meters (1,280 feet) of churning, frigid water, the society said. Its towering mast is lying broken beside it, likely cracked off as the vessel was sucked into the depths after it struck ice on May 5, 1962.. “I heard that some Americans were interested in finding Quest, and I just had this picture in my mind of a few billionaires on yachts, up in the Labrador Sea,” John Geiger, leader of the Shackleton Quest Expedition and the chief executive of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, told an audience at the Memorial University’s Marine Institute in St. John’s, Newfoundland, on Wednesday.. “We’ve done it the right way. It’s not about anyone’s ego, it’s about telling great stories and celebrating some of the finest human attributes,” Geiger said.. He called the Quest a historically very important ship. . Shackleton’s death aboard the ship in 1922 marked the end of what historians consider the “heroic age” of Antarctic exploration. The explorer led three British expeditions to the Antarctic, and he was in the early stages of a fourth when he died of a heart attack. He was 47.. The Norwegian-built Quest was a schooner-rigged steamship, and Shackleton bought it specifically to travel to Canada’s High Arctic, Geiger said. But the Canadian government at the time axed those plans, and Shackleton decided to set sail once again for the Antarctic.. He died when it was just off South Georgia, east of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. . After the explorer’s death, the Quest was used for Arctic research and then returned to its original intended use as a sealing vessel. It sank in 1962, after it was damaged by ice in the Labrador Sea while on a whaling trip.. The vessel appears to be in “incredible condition,” though it was damaged when it slammed into the seabed, Geiger said.. It won’t be brought to the surface — that would be far too expensive, he added — but it will be thoroughly documented and studied. A crew will likely head out some time before the end of summer to begin taking footage of the vessel with a remotely operated vehicle.. In 2022, researchers discovered another one of Shackleton’s ships, the Endurance in 10,000 feet — about 3,000 meters — of icy water, a century after it was swallowed up by Antarctic ice. . A team of marine archaeologists, engineers and other scientists used an icebreaker ship and underwater drones to locate the wreck at the bottom of the Weddell Sea, near the Antarctica Peninsula.. The expedition Endurance22 embarked from Cape Town, South Africa, in early February in a ship capable of breaking through 3-foot (1-meter)-thick ice.. The team, which included more than 100 researchers and crew members, deployed underwater drones that combed the seafloor for two weeks in the area where the ship was recorded to have sunk in 1915.. Shackleton never achieved his ambition to become the first person to cross Antarctica via the South Pole. In fact, he never set foot on the continent during the failed Endurance expedition, though he did visit Antarctica during earlier voyages.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

SAN FRANCISCO -- Elon Musk has dropped his lawsuit against OpenAI just ahead of a scheduled Wednesday hearing on the case.. Musk in February sued the San Francisco artificial intelligence company and its CEO Sam Altman over what he said was a betrayal of the ChatGPT maker’s founding aims of benefiting humanity rather than pursuing profits.. In the lawsuit filed in February at San Francisco Superior Court, billionaire Musk said that when he bankrolled OpenAI’s creation, he secured an agreement with Altman and Greg Brockman, the president, to keep the AI company as a nonprofit that would develop technology for the benefit of the public and keep its code open instead of walling it off for private gain.. However, by embracing a close relationship with Microsoft, OpenAI and its top executives set that pact “aflame” and are “perverting” the company’s mission, Musk alleged in the lawsuit.. Most legal experts said Musk's claims — centered around allegations of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and unfair business practices — were unlikely to succeed in court. Musk's lawyer filed a notice Tuesday seeking to dismiss the entire case. No explanation was given for why it was being dropped.. Neither Musk nor anyone representing him in the case showed up at a status hearing Wednesday.. Musk's lawyers and OpenAI didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesian authorities said Wednesday they have arrested six suspects in an international poaching ring targeting the Javan rhinoceros, a critically endangered species.. The suspects are part of a network that used homemade firearms to kill at least 26 Javan rhinos since 2018 to get their horns. The horns are in high demand in Asia where they're predominantly used in traditional Chinese medicine and increasingly for making ornaments, said Banten provincial police chief Abdul Karim.. He said the six men were arrested in a joint operation by police and the Forestry and Environment Ministry last month. One of the leaders of the syndicate, Sunendi, was arrested last year and sentenced to 12 years in prison and a 100-million rupiah ($6,135) fine.. Police and a team of rangers from Banten’s Ujung Kulon National Park were searching for eight other members of the syndicate, officials said. . Karim said an investigation found that Sunendi, who uses a single name like many Indonesians, and nine others had killed 22 Javan rhinos since 2018, while another group had killed four more since 2021. They sold the horns to Chinese buyers through a local handler, who is currently on trial. . Police seized homemade firearms, bullets, gun powder, a steel sling noose and other equipment used to poach rhinos. . Rasio Ridho Sani, the head of law enforcement at the Forestry and Environment Ministry, said the population of the Javan rhino is declining and only about 80 mature animals remain, mostly in the Ujung Kulon National Park in the western part of Indonesia’s main Java island. They are threatened by destruction of tropical forest habitat and poachers, he said.. “Poaching of protected animals is a serious crime and is of international concern,” Sani said. “We are working closely with the Banten Regional Police to search and arrest the perpetrators of animal poaching crimes who managed to escape during the operation.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Europe wants affordable electric vehicles from China. But not at the cost of its own auto industry,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/europe-affordable-electric-vehicles-china-cost-auto-industry-111052747,2024-06-12 13:10:30,"The European Union is moving to hike tariffs on electric vehicles made in China. FRANKFURT, Germany -- The European Union moved Wednesday to hike tariffs, or import taxes, on electric vehicles made in China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and the Asian nation's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc. . Here are some basic facts about the EU's planned tariffs: . The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said the preliminary results of its ongoing investigation into Chinese EV subsidies show that the country's battery electric vehicle “value chain” benefits from ""unfair subsidization"" that hurts EU rivals. It plans to impose provisional tariffs of up to 38.1% on electric vehicles shipped from China. That's on top of the 10% duties for all imported EVs. . The commission took aim at three of the biggest Chinese EV players in Europe, saying it would impose extra duties of 17.4% on electric cars from BYD, 20% on those from Geely and 38.1% for vehicles exported by China's state-owned SAIC. . Geely owns a stable of popular brands, including Polestar, British sports car maker Lotus and Sweden's Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain's MG, one of Europe's bestselling EV brands. . Other EV manufacturers in China would be subject to duties of at least 21%. . The commission said it has reached out to Chinese authorities to ""explore possible ways to resolve the issues"" but if those discussions don't result in an effective solution, the duties will take effect on July 4. . The value of battery-powered cars imported to Europe skyrocketed from $1.6 billion in 2020 to $11.5 billion last year, according to research firm Rhodium Group. Most of the imports are from Western automakers with factories in China, including Tesla and BMW. . But EU officials complain Chinese's homegrown automakers are poised to gobble up market share by undercutting European car brands on price thanks to Beijing’s massive subsidies.. EU officials fear unfairly subsidized imports will hurt Europe's manufacturers and the continent's green tech industries. European countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.. The planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers. The commission didn't single out Western auto brands, but mentioned that Tesla might get an “individually calculated” rate if duties are definitively imposed. . The Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25% The U.S. currently imports very few Chinese cars, but like the European Commission, the administration worries that subsidies hurt domestic companies and cost jobs. . The U.S. tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports. In contrast, the European Union needs affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve its goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. . Chinese carmakers have learned to make electric vehicles cheaply amid ferocious price competition at home in the world's largest car market. BYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 euros ($23,370) in China but 41,990 euros ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium Group figures. The base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for the equivalent of around $10,000 in China.. As long as a competitive business environment is fair, cheaper Chinese cars benefit consumers and push European carmakers to lower their prices and improve their offerings, according to Niclas Poitiers, a trade expert at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. “They are very cost-competitive and increase the pressure on other manufacturers that have been dragging their heels,” he said.. It’s the unfair access to subsidies that Europe objects to. “An EU green policy that would lead to the demise of domestic manufacturers because of unfair competition would not be politically sustainable,” Poitiers said. . In China's “market socialist” economy, state-owned companies play a leading role. The government also guides and supports privately owned companies to achieve Beijing's economic development goals. . For EVs, that includes orders for government fleets, low-interest loans from state-owned banks, cheap land for factories from local governments, tax breaks, and subsidized raw materials and parts from state-owned industries.. The various forms of financial help complicate the EU’s case because it’s difficult to gather data on some of the practices. The EU indicated it selected BYD, Geely and SAIC as a sample to calculate the duties. Other manufacturers in China that cooperated with the investigation but weren't sampled will face extra duties of 21%, while those that didn't cooperate will be hit with the 38.1% rate, the commission said. . Chinese cars are likely to cost more, reducing pressure on European carmakers to keep their prices down. But Chinese companies are able to make cars so cheaply they might still be able to sell at a profit, even with duties as high as 30%. . European carmakers that manufacture electric vehicles in China might wind up as collateral damage. They get some government support in China but less than their Chinese competitors.. Five of BYD's six models would still earn a profit in Europe even at a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations. Meanwhile a China-made Tesla Model 3 would sell at a loss. . Duties at the 15-30% level could “wipe out the business model for foreign players such as BMW and Tesla, which are using China as a base for exporting to Europe,” the Rhodium Group said in a report.. China is almost certain to retaliate and to pressure European officials to negotiate. The China Chamber of Commerce to the EU warned that Beijing could raise duties on cars with engines larger than 2.5 liters, a move that could affect German luxury carmakers such as Volkswagen’s Porsche.. Beijing lashed out after the European Commission unveiled its plans. The higher tariffs are “a naked act of protectionism, creating and escalating trade friction, and ‘destroying fair competition’ in the name of ‘safeguarding fair competition,’"" the Commerce Ministry said. It urged the EU to “rectify its wrongdoings immediately” and said China would “resolutely take all necessary measures,” without elaborating.. Yet the impact may be smaller than feared, according to analysts at research firm Sanford C. Bernstein.. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen now make most of the cars they sell in China at factories there. Only 2% of Volkswagen’s China sales are imports and thus vulnerable to higher tariffs; it’s 15% for BMW and 19% for Mercedes-Benz.. European cars at risk of getting slapped with Chinese tariffs tend to be luxury vehicles that bring juicy profits, like Mercedes' S-Class vehicles and BMW's X6 and X7. However, such cars cater to rich customers who might be inclined to pay higher prices “as long as their purchase behavior is not deemed to be unpatriotic,” the Bernstein analysts noted.. Over the longer term, Chinese carmakers could avoid tariffs by making cars in Europe. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain's Catalonia region.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,"Faking an honest woman: Why Russia, China and Big Tech all use faux females to get clicks",https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/faking-honest-woman-russia-china-big-tech-faux-111044459,2024-06-12 06:38:13,"When it comes to online scams and foreign disinformation, it pays to be female. WASHINGTON -- When disinformation researcher Wen-Ping Liu looked into China's efforts to influence Taiwan's recent election using fake social media accounts, something unusual stood out about the most successful profiles.. They were female, or at least that's what they appeared to be. Fake profiles that claimed to be women got more engagement, more eyeballs and more influence than supposedly male accounts.. “Pretending to be a female is the easiest way to get credibility,” said Liu, an investigator with Taiwan's Ministry of Justice.. Whether it’s Chinese or Russian propaganda agencies, online scammers or AI chatbots, it pays to be female — proving that while technology may grow more and more sophisticated, the human brain remains surprisingly easy to hack thanks in part to age-old gender stereotypes that have migrated from the real world to the virtual.. People have long assigned human characteristics like gender to inanimate objects — ships are one example — so it makes sense that human-like traits would make fake social media profiles or chatbots more appealing. However, questions about how these technologies can reflect and reinforce gender stereotypes are getting attention as more voice assistants and AI-enabled chatbots enter the market, further blurring the lines between man (and woman) and machine.. “You want to inject some emotion and warmth and a very easy way to do that is to pick a woman’s face and voice,” said Sylvie Borau, a marketing professor and online researcher in Toulouse, France, whose work has found that internet users prefer “female” bots and see them as more human than “male” versions.. People tend to see women as warmer, less threatening and more agreeable than men, Borau told The Associated Press. Men, meanwhile, are often perceived to be more competent, though also more likely to be threatening or hostile. Because of this many people may be, consciously or unconsciously, more willing to engage with a fake account that poses as female.. When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was searching for a new voice for the ChatGPT AI program, he approached Scarlett Johansson, who said Altman told her that users would find her voice — which served as the eponymous voice assistant in the movie “Her” — “comforting."" Johansson declined Altman’s request and threatened to sue when the company went with what she called an “eerily similar” voice. OpenAI put the new voice on hold.. Feminine profile pictures, particularly ones showing women with flawless skin, lush lips and wide eyes in revealing outfits, can be another online lure for many men.. Users also treat bots differently based on their perceived sex: Borau’s research has found that “female” chatbots are far more likely to receive sexual harassment and threats than “male” bots.. Female social media profiles receive on average more than three times the views compared to those of males, according to an analysis of more than 40,000 profiles conducted for the AP by Cyabra, an Israeli tech firm that specializes in bot detection. Female profiles that claim to be younger get the most views, Cyabra found.. “Creating a fake account and presenting it as a woman will help the account gain more reach compared to presenting it as a male,” according to Cyabra's report.. The online influence campaigns mounted by nations like China and Russia have long used faux females to spread propaganda and disinformation. These campaigns often exploit people's views of women. Some appear as wise, nurturing grandmothers dispensing homespun wisdom, while others mimic young, conventionally attractive women eager to talk politics with older men.. Last month, researchers at the firm NewsGuard found hundreds of fake accounts — some boasting AI-generated profile pictures — were used to criticize President Joe Biden. It happened after some Trump supporters began posting a personal photo with the announcement that they “will not be voting for Joe Biden.”. While many of the posts were authentic, more than 700 came from fake accounts. Most of the profiles claimed to be young women living in states like Illinois or Florida; one was named PatriotGal480. But many of the accounts used nearly identical language, and had profile photos that were AI-generated or stolen from other users. And while they couldn’t say for sure who was operating the fake accounts, they found dozens with links to nations including Russia and China.. X removed the accounts after NewsGuard contacted the platform.. A report from the U.N. suggested there's an even more obvious reason why so many fake accounts and chatbots are female: they were created by men. The report, entitled “ Are Robots Sexist?,” looked at gender disparities in tech industries and concluded that greater diversity in programming and AI development could lead to fewer sexist stereotypes embedded in their products.. For programmers eager to make their chatbots as human as possible, this creates a dilemma, Borau said: if they select a female persona, are they encouraging sexist views about real-life women?. “It’s a vicious cycle,” Borau said. “Humanizing AI might dehumanize women.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A Silicon Valley-backed initiative to build a green city for up to 400,000 people in the San Francisco Bay Area has qualified for the Nov. 5 ballot, elections officials said Tuesday. . Solano County's registrar of voters said in a statement that the office verified a sufficient sampling of signatures. California Forever, the company behind the campaign, submitted well over the 13,000 valid signatures required to qualify. . The registrar is scheduled to present the results of the count to the county Board of Supervisors in two weeks, at which point the board can order an impact assessment report.. Voters will be asked to allow urban development on 27 square miles (70 square kilometers) of land between Travis Air Force Base and the Sacramento River Delta city of Rio Vista currently zoned for agriculture. The land-use change is necessary to build the homes, jobs and walkable downtown proposed by Jan Sramek, a former Goldman Sachs trader who heads up California Forever.. Sramek, who has the backing of wealthy investors such as philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, disclosed that the campaign spent $2 million in the first quarter of 2024. . He expects the amount spent to be higher in the second quarter, he told The Associated Press in an interview before the ballot initiative was certified. . Opposition to the effort includes conservation groups and some local and federal officials who say the plan is a speculative money grab rooted in secrecy. Sramek outraged locals by covertly purchasing more than $800 million in farmland and even suing farmers who refused to sell. . The Solano Land Trust, which protects open lands, said last week that such large-scale development “will have a detrimental impact on Solano County’s water resources, air quality, traffic, farmland, and natural environment.”. Sramek expects to have 50,000 residents in the new city within the next decade. The proposal includes an initial $400 million to help residents buy homes in the community, as well as an initial guarantee of 15,000 local jobs paying a salary of at least $88,000 a year. . Companies that specialize in aerospace and defense manufacturing and indoor vertical farming are among those expressing interest should voters approve the project, California Forever previously announced.

abcnews.com,"Mexico expedition sights only 6 to 8 vaquita porpoises, the most endangered marine mammal",https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/mexico-expedition-sights-6-8-vaquita-porpoises-endangered-111043058,2024-06-11 22:30:26,"Only six to eight critically endangered vaquita marina porpoises were sighted this year in the Gulf of California. MEXICO CITY -- The number of Mexico’s critically endangered vaquita marina porpoises sighted in the Gulf of California fell to between 6 and 8 this year, researchers said Tuesday. . But it is possible that some of the few remaining vaquitas — the world's smallest porpoise and most endangered marine mammal — may have moved elsewhere in the Gulf, the only place in the world where they live.. Last year, experts on a sighting expedition estimated they saw from 10 to 13 of the tiny, shy, elusive porpoises during nearly two weeks of sailing in the Gulf, also known as the Sea of Cortez.. But this year, the conservation group Sea Shepherd said a similar expedition May 5-26 sighted only about a half dozen, though the search was not as extensive as last year's. More troubling, no baby vaquitas were seen this year.. “Unlike 2023, no recently born calves were seen, but a healthy juvenile was seen,” Sea Shepherd said in a statement.. However, about half the sightings last year occurred outside and just west of the vaquitas' exclusive protection zone, a heavily patrolled area in the Gulf where all fishing is prohibited, though some still occurs illegally.. Experts aren't exactly sure why vaquitas might like the area just outside the protected zone, but this year's expedition concentrated on areas inside the zone.. Because they are so small and elusive, many times the vaquitas can only be seen from far away through powerful binoculars, and so such sightings are categorized as probable or likely. Thus, the numbers are expressed in probable “ranges” of the real figure.. The animals also emit “clicks” that can be heard through acoustic monitoring devices.. “While these results are worrying, the area surveyed represents only 12% of the total area where vaquitas were observed in 2015,"" said Dr. Barbara Taylor, the researcher who led the study. “Since vaquitas move freely within the vaquita refuge, we must extend the survey using acoustic detection to determine where the vaquitas are going.”. There are plans to do just that. But according to the previous report, “fishermen have begun removing the acoustic devices (CPODs) used to record vaquita clicks. The data recorded on each device is lost, and it is expensive to replace the stolen CPODs.”. “Unless enforcement of the fishing ban is effective and the theft of equipment is stopped, acoustic monitoring cannot collect data as it has in the past,” the report stated.. Last year's report had raised hopes for the species, which lives nowhere else and cannot be captured, held or bred in captivity.. But this year's report was another piece of continued bad news for the species. Illegal gillnets have trapped and killed vaquitas for decades; the reported population has declined from nearly 600 vaquitas in 1997.. Fishermen set the nets to catch totoaba, a fish whose swim bladder is considered a delicacy in China and can fetch thousands of dollars per pound.. While the Mexican government has made some efforts to stop the net fishing — like sinking concrete blocks with hooks to snag nets in the protected zone — the fishermen still appear to have the upper hand, setting illegal nets regularly and even sabotaging monitoring efforts.. Alex Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity, said “vaquitas reproduce so slowly that recovery is impossible without help, and their very survival remains in grave doubt.”. “Vaquitas face a serious threat of extinction from dangerous gillnets in their habitat and the Mexican government’s lax enforcement of protective regulations,” Olivera said, noting “it’s crucial” that enforcement be stepped up now.. Olivera, who was not part of the expedition, previously estimated that “even in a gillnet-free habitat, it will take about 50 years for the population to return to where it was 15 years ago.” . President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s administration has largely declined to spend money to compensate fishermen for staying out of the vaquita refuge and stop using gillnets, or monitor their presence or the areas they launch from.. Sea Shepherd has been working in the Gulf alongside the Mexican Navy to discourage illegal fishing in the protected area. The government’s protection efforts have been uneven, at best, and also often face violent opposition from local fishermen.. ___.

abcnews.com,Amazon adds $1.4 billion to affordable housing fund for regions where it has corporate offices,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/amazon-invests-14-billion-affordable-housing-options-regions-111037995,2024-06-11 19:26:16,"Amazon is adding $1.4 billion to a fund it established three years ago for preserving or building more affordable housing in the regions where the company has major corporate offices. NEW YORK -- Amazon is adding $1.4 billion to a fund it established three years ago for preserving or building more affordable housing in regions where the company has major corporate offices, CEO Andy Jassy announced Tuesday. . The Seattle-based company said the new sum would go on top of the $2.2 billion it had already invested to help create or preserve 21,000 affordable housing units in three areas: the Puget Sound in Washington state; Arlington, Virginia; and Nashville, Tennessee. When it launched its Housing Equity Fund in January 2021, Amazon said it aimed to fund 20,000 units over five years. . The additional money will go to the same regions with a goal of building or maintaining 14,000 more homes through grants and below-market-rate loans. To date, most of the funding went to non-profit and for-profit developers in the form of loans that allow Amazon to earn revenue through interest payments. Amazon said 80% of the units also benefited from government funding. . Like other tech companies that have made similar investments, Amazon launched its affordable housing fund following years of complaints that well-paid tech workers helped drive up housing costs in regions where their employers had set up major hubs. . Housing advocates in cities like Seattle and San Francisco have long blamed an influx of corporate workers for driving up the demand for housing and pricing out long-time residents. . Alice Shobe, the global director of Amazon Community Impact division, said 59% of the units Amazon supported so far have been preservation projects that make use of existing housing. They include donations and loans to nonprofits and local government agencies that can purchase buildings and stabilize rents, or otherwise maintain naturally occurring affordable housing.. In addition to maintaining housing stock, such projects prevent private developers from remodeling apartment buildings and putting the units on the market at much higher prices, Shobe said in an interview. . “We’ve made a big difference in both the amount and quality of affordable housing in these three communities,” she said. . Amazon targets its investments to provide housing for individuals with low-to-moderate incomes, which the company defines as those earning 30% to 80% of a given region's “area median income.” The company has said it wants to focus on what it calls the “missing middle,"" a demographic that includes professionals like nursing assistants and teachers who don’t qualify for government subsidies but still struggle to pay rent. . In September, Amazon made a $40 million investment to drive home ownership in the three regions. But the rest of the money so far has gone toward apartment buildings. . The company previously received some criticism in Northern Virginia for neglecting the housing needs of people on the lower end of the income spectrum. Projects designed for such individuals are likely to require more government subsidies and take longer to complete, said Derek Hyra, a professor at American University and a founding director of the Metropolitan Policy Center. . Shobe said Amazon has worked to maintain a “mixed portfolio” without losing its focus on the missing middle. Currently, the company says most of the units it has supported serve households earning less than 60% of the area median income, which goes up to $82,200 for a family of four in Washington state's King County, where Seattle is located.. Companies like Amazon can help with the supply of affordable housing, but their money alone won’t do much to move the needle without significant investments from the federal government, according to Hyra. . “They have a good amount of money, but not enough money to solve the problem,” he said.. An internal Amazon memo that was leaked last year to the nonprofit labor organization Warehouse Worker Resource Center and posted online shows the company sees its philanthropy as a tool that can help it burnish its reputation. . According to a person familiar with the matter, the housing fund previously sat under Amazon’s government and corporate affairs division. However, it was moved to the company’s public relations arm when Jay Carney, Amazon’s former public policy and communications chief, left in 2022, the person said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Judges hear Elizabeth Holmes' appeal of fraud conviction while she remains in Texas prison,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/judges-hear-elizabeth-holmes-appeal-fraud-conviction-remains-111041945,2024-06-11 21:26:28,"A panel of federal judges have spent two hours wrestling with a series of legal issues raised in an attempt to overturn a fraud conviction that sent Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes to prison after a meteoric rise to Silicon Valley stardom. SAN FRANCISCO -- A panel of federal judges spent two hours on Tuesday wrestling with a series of legal issues raised in an attempt to overturn a fraud conviction that sent Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes to prison after a meteoric rise to Silicon Valley stardom.. The hearing held in the San Francisco appeals court came nearly 2 1/2 years after a jury convicted Holmes for orchestrating a blood-testing scam that became a parable about greed and hubris in Silicon Valley. Holmes' instrument of deception was Theranos, a Palo Alto, California, startup that she founded shortly after dropping out of Stanford University in 2003 with her sights set on revolutionizing the health care industry.. Holmes, who did not attend the hearing, is currently serving an 11-year sentence in a Bryan, Texas prison.. But Holmes' parents and her partner Billy Evans — the father of her two young children — sat in the front row of the courtroom listening intently to the oral arguments. All three federal prosecutors who presented the U.S. Justice Department's case during the original four-month trial were sitting in the courtroom audience, including two attorneys — Jeffrey Schenk and John Bostic — who have since gone to work for private law firms.. Three appeals court judges — Jacqueline Nguyen, Ryan Nelson and Mary Schroeder — gave few clues into whether they leaned toward upholding or overturning Holmes' conviction. However, they periodically made it clear that it would take compelling evidence for them to throw out the jury's verdict. . Nelson seemed the most torn of the three judges, showing some sympathy when Holmes’ attorney Amy Saharia said the outcome of her trial deserved close scrutiny because the jury also acquitted her on four other counts of fraud and conspiracy and was unable to reach a verdict on three other counts.. Before adjourning the hearing, Nguyen said a ruling would be issued in “due course” without providing a specific timeline. Appeals courts can take anywhere from a few weeks to more than a year before ruling on appeals involving criminal convictions.. Holmes will remain in prison, with a currently scheduled release date of August 2032 — earlier than her full sentence because of her good behavior so far. . A decade ago, Theranos had become such a hot health care commodity that it was called an exemplar of U.S. ingenuity by several prominent people, including then-Vice President Joe Biden. Holmes had emerged as a media sensation with a fortune worth $4.5 billion. . The excitement stemmed from Holmes' claim that Theranos-designed devices could scan a few drops of human blood for hundreds of potential diseases. But the devices produced unreliable results that both Holmes and her former business partner and lover at the time, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, attempted to hide. . Once the glaring flaws of its technology were exposed, Theranos collapsed in a scandal that led to criminal charges being filed against both Holmes and Balwani. Prosecutors hoped to break a ""fake-it-till-you-make-it'' mentality that had been adopted by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs hoping to strike it rich with still-buggy products.. Besides hearing from Holmes' lawyers Tuesday, the panel of appeals judges also listened to arguments from another flank of attorneys representing Balwani, who is trying to overturn the 13-year prison sentence he received after his July 2022 conviction for fraud and conspiracy in a separate trial.. Balwani, 58, contends federal prosecutors distorted evidence to bias the jury against him while weaving a different narrative than the story they presented during Holmes' trial, which was completed shortly before Balwani's trial began in March 2022. Unlike Holmes, Balwani was convicted on all 12 felony counts of fraud and conspiracy facing him, a factor that contributed to his lengthier prison sentence. He is currently scheduled to be released from a Southern California federal prison in November 2033.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

NEW YORK -- Thousands of delivery drivers filed legal claims against Amazon on Tuesday, alleging the company’s classification of them as independent contractors instead of employees has led to unpaid wages and other financial losses. . Two law firms spearheading the action said about 15,860 Amazon Flex drivers have submitted arbitration claims with the American Arbitration Association, where 453 similar cases are already being litigated. . Amazon’s Flex program, which was founded in 2015, signs up drivers to deliver packages with their own cars and a special app. . The company pitches the work as a flexible, part-time opportunity that allows people to earn extra income during the hours they choose. Most drivers earn $18-25 per hour, according to Amazon, though how much they get paid can depend on other factors, such as their location and how long it takes to complete deliveries. . The arbitration claims submitted Tuesday were made by drivers in California, Illinois and Massachusetts, all of which have rules that limit the amount of control companies can exert over independent contractors. The claims, collected over a span of four years by attorneys Joseph Sellers and Steven Tindall, maintain the drivers should be classified as Amazon employees instead of independent contractors, based on current laws in the three states.. That change would allow Flex drivers to collect unpaid wages because Amazon only pays them for a pre-determined number of hours regardless of how long it takes to complete deliveries, according to the lawyers. It would also allow Flex drivers to receive overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week and get reimbursements for work-related expenses, such as gas costs and vehicle wear and tear. . Gas and other vehicle costs are a ""huge expense to our clients,” Tindall said during an interview. He also said one client represented in the claims worked 7-day weeks making deliveries for Amazon during a holiday period and never was paid overtime. . In a prepared statement, Amazon spokesperson Branden Baribeau touted the benefits of the Flex program, saying it gives “individuals the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss, while earning competitive pay.”. “We hear from most of the Amazon Flex delivery partners that they love the flexibility of the program, and we’re proud of the work they do on behalf of customers every day,” Baribeau said. . Tindall and Sellers say they have so far succeeded in seven of the eight arbitration claims against Amazon they took to trial. The drivers they represented in those cases were awarded an average of $9,000 in damages. . Amazon’s business model for its driving workforce - made up of independent contractors and third-party businesses that allow the company to avoid unionization – faces scrutiny and challenges from different corners. . A bipartisan group of more than 30 U.S. senators sent Amazon CEO Andy Jassy a letter last week asking for more information on the company’s relationship with the thousands of independent businesses that make millions of deliveries each day as part of Amazon's Delivery Service Partners program. . In March, the Wisconsin Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling that declared Flex drivers to be employees - a decision that would allow them to be part of the state’s unemployment insurance system and entitled to jobless pay if they are laid off.. The Teamsters union, which is seeking to organize Amazon’s drivers, also filed a complaint at the National Labor Relations Board last year challenging how the company classifies some of its drivers. . __.

abcnews.com,Future of Elon Musk and Tesla are on the line this week as shareholders vote on massive pay package,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/future-elon-musk-tesla-line-week-shareholders-vote-111026376,2024-06-12 16:14:34,"If Tesla shareholders vote against restoring Elon Musk’s $44.9 billion pay package Thursday, the CEO could deliver on threats to take artificial intelligence research to one of his other companies. DETROIT -- If Tesla shareholders vote against restoring Elon Musk's $44.9 billion pay package Thursday, the CEO could deliver on threats to take artificial intelligence research to one of his other companies. Or he could even could walk away.. If they approve the all-stock compensation package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge in January, it would almost guarantee he would remain at the company he grew to be the world leader in electric vehicles, shifting to AI and robotics including autonomous vehicles, which Musk says is Tesla's future.. But even with reapproval at Thursday's annual shareholders' meeting, which many analysts say is likely, there would be uncertainty. Musk has threatened on X, his social media platform, to develop AI elsewhere if he doesn't get a 25% stake in Tesla (He owns about 13% now). Musk's xAI recently received $6 billion in funding to develop artificial intelligence. . Wedbush Analyst Dan Ives said he expects the package to be overwhelmingly reapproved, ending a lot of uncertainty with Musk. “This issue has been an overhang on Tesla’s stock, and this will be important to move this distraction in the rearview mirror,” Ives wrote in a note to investors.. Shares of Tesla Inc. have slumped more than 30% this year with the company warning of “notably lower” sales growth in 2024.. Also on the shareholder ballot is the related issue of moving the electric vehicle maker's legal home out of Delaware to Texas. . The move is designed to escape from the Delaware court's oversight and possibly a ruling from Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick that invalidated Musk's pay package. In a January opinion on a shareholder lawsuit, the judge determined that Musk controlled the Tesla board and is not entitled to the landmark package once worth nearly $56 billion.. Multiple institutional investors have come out against that sizeable payout, some citing falling vehicle sales, price cuts and the tumbling Tesla stock price. But Tesla's top five institutional shareholders, Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Geode Capital, and Capital Research either said they don't announce their votes or wouldn't comment. They control about 17% of the votes. . Erik Gordon, a business and law professor at the University of Michigan, said individual shareholders are likely to vote for the package, and they own more than half of Tesla's shares.. One institutional investor who came out against the package is California's State Teachers Retirement System. The large pension fund said Tuesday that it would vote against Musk's pay ""based on its sheer magnitude, and because the award would be extremely dilutive to shareholders. We also have concerns with the lack of focus on profitability for the company.”. In May, two big shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended voting against the package. . But Tesla and Musk have unleashed a furious lobbying effort to get the package approved, in posts on X, television appearances and in proxy filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.. “Only 2 days left to protect & help grow the value of your investment in $TSLA by voting FOR ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award,” Tesla posted on X early Tuesday.. Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm, in a letter to shareholders, wrote that the package was approved by 73% of the vote six years ago. “Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value. That strikes us — and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard — as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it,” she wrote.. Tesla has said the 2018 award incentivized Musk to create over $735 billion in value for shareholders in the six years since it was approved.. If Tesla finalizes the vote on moving the company's legal home to Texas before the vote on Musk’s pay package, and it manages to file the paperwork in Austin and get approval of the move, then the effect of the Delaware court ruling could be in doubt. Reapproval of the pay package would then be done as a Texas corporation and could fall under the purview of Texas courts.. Anticipating a quick move by Tesla, lawyers for the shareholder who filed the lawsuit seeking to block Musk’s pay deal, Richard Tornetta, filed motions in Delaware last month seeking an order stopping Tesla from trying to move the case. Tesla responded in letters to the judge that there is no cause for such concerns because they won’t seek a move. Besides, Tesla would still be a Delaware corporation at the time of this week's shareholder vote, they wrote.. In an order denying Tornetta’s motions, Chancellor McCormick wrote that she interprets Tesla’s letters to mean it has no intention of relocating the case to Texas. “The defendants’ statements give me great comfort,” she wrote.. Eric Talley, a Columbia University law professor, said the lawyers are unlikely to try to move the case because their livelihood is handling business cases in Delaware courts.. But it’s also possible that the unpredictable Musk could change lawyers.. McCormick, Talley said, is telling the lawyers “OK, I’m going to believe you, but I’m going to be really irritated if this is a big send up for these things that you said you’re not going to do.”. Talley, who also is a Tesla shareholder and said at present he plans to vote against Musk’s pay, expects Tesla to follow through with appealing McCormick’s ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

DALLAS -- Space tourists experience some of the same body changes as astronauts who spend months in orbit, according to new studies published Tuesday.. Those shifts mostly returned to normal once the amateurs returned to Earth, researchers reported.. Research on four space tourists is included in a series of studies on the health effects of space travel, down to the molecular level. The findings paint a clearer picture of how people — who don't undergo years of astronaut training — adapt to weightlessness and space radiation, the researchers said.. “This will allow us to be better prepared when we’re sending humans into space for whatever reason,” said Allen Liu, a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Michigan who was not involved with the research.. NASA and others have long studied the toll of space travel on astronauts, including yearlong residents of the International Space Station, but there's been less attention on space tourists. The first tourist visit to the space station was in 2001, and opportunities for private space travel have expanded in recent years.. A three-day chartered flight in 2021 gave researchers the chance to examine how quickly the body reacts and adapts to spaceflight, said Susan Bailey, a radiation expert at Colorado State University who took part in the research.. While in space, the four passengers on the SpaceX flight, dubbed Inspiration4, collected samples of blood, saliva, skin and more. Researchers analyzed the samples and found wide-ranging shifts in cells and changes to the immune system. Most of these shifts stabilized in the months after the four returned home, and the researchers found that the short-term spaceflight didn’t pose significant health risks.. “This is the first time we've had a cell-by-cell examination of a crew when they go to space,” said researcher and co-author Chris Mason with Weill Cornell Medicine.. The papers, which were published Tuesday in Nature journals and are now part of a database, include the impact of spaceflight on the skin, kidneys and immune system. The results could help researchers find ways to counteract the negative effects of space travel, said Afshin Beheshti, a researcher with the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science who took part in the work.. ___.

The new features are part of Apple's annual iOS update that will arrive in the fall, the company said. Apple revealed some of the features at its annual developer conference this week and released more details Tuesday.. The biggest change for consumers will be ability for banks to offer multiple forms of financing to customers within Apple Pay, as well as the ability pay with rewards points or programs through an iPhone or other Apple device. iPhone users currently can use credit or debit cards to fund Apple Pay purchases. . Apple will now give banks the ability to offer other forms of financing through the same credit cards, like buy now, pay later, monthly installment plans, or the use of reward points. . Buy now, pay later company Affirm will be integrated into Apple Pay, allowing customers to apply for an account with Affirm inside of Apple Pay. Shares of Affirm rose nearly 5% Tuesday on the news. Apple said that its own buy now, pay later service, known as Apple Pay Later, is not going anywhere and the other major buy now, pay later companies like Klarna will also be able to integrate into Apple Wallet. .

It could spell trouble for new airport",https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/4000-year-cretan-hilltop-mystifies-greek-archaeologists-spell-111022567,2024-06-11 14:54:14,"A big, round, 4,000-year-old stone building discovered on a Cretan hilltop is puzzling archaeologists and threatening to disrupt a major airport project on the Greek tourist island. ATHENS, Greece -- A big, round, 4,000-year-old stone building discovered on a Cretan hilltop is puzzling archaeologists and threatening to disrupt a major airport project on the Greek tourist island.. Greece's Culture Ministry said Tuesday that the structure is a “unique and extremely interesting find” from Crete's Minoan civilization, famous for its sumptuous palaces, flamboyant art and enigmatic writing system. Resembling a huge car wheel from above, the ruins of the labyrinthine, 1,800-square-meter (19,000-square-foot) building came to light during a recent dig by archaeologists. . The site was earmarked for a radar station to serve a new airport under construction near the town of Kastelli. Set to open in 2027, it's projected to replace Greece's second-biggest airport at Heraklion, and designed to handle up to 18 million travelers annually.. Archaeologists don't yet know what the hilltop structure was for. It's still under excavation and has no known Minoan parallels. So for the time being, experts speculate it could have been used for a ritual or religious function.. Ringed by eight stepped stone walls up to 1.7 meters (5.6 feet) high, the inner structure was split into smaller, interconnecting spaces and may have had a shallow conical roof.. The ministry's statement said it didn't appear to have been a dwelling, and the finds from inside it included a large quantity of animal bones.. “It may have been periodically used for possibly ritual ceremonies involving consumption of food, wine, and perhaps offerings,” the statement said.. “Its size, architectural layout and careful construction required considerable labor, specialized know-how and a robust central administration,” it said, adding it was certainly some kind of communal building that stood out in the entire area.. Culture Minister Lina Mendoni, an archaeologist, pledged that the find would be preserved while a different location would be sought for the radar station.. “We all understand the value and importance of cultural heritage ... as well as the growth potential” of the new airport project, she said. “It's possible to go ahead with the airport while granting the antiquities the protection they merit.”. The ministry said the building was mainly used between 2000-1700 B.C, and was founded around the time Crete's first palaces were being built — including at Knossos and Phaistos.. It said some of its features were comparable with early Minoan beehive tombs that were surmounted by stepped conical roofs and burial mounds in other parts of Greece.. Greece's rich cultural heritage often results in conflicts of interest during construction projects.. At the end of the last century, an entire hilltop fortified settlement from the 3rd millennium B.C. was excavated and then destroyed during construction work for Athens International Airport.. So far, at least another 35 archaeological sites have been uncovered during work on the new Kastelli airport and its road connections, the ministry said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

Apple announced a slew of new features for iOS 18 at Monday's developers conference event, many of which are designed to enhance the Siri assistant and bring artificial intelligence tools to iPhone users.. The AI-packed updates coming in the fall are meant to enable the billions of people who use the company’s devices to get more done in less time, while also giving them access to creative tools that could liven things up. For instance, Apple will deploy AI to allow people to create emojis, dubbed “Genmojis” on the fly to fit the vibe they are trying to convey.. The full suite of upcoming AI features will only work on the recent iPhone 15 line because the functions require advanced processors. But there are still plenty of upgrades for all iPhone owners.. Here are some of the best new features coming to iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence.. Apple confirmed that it will be rolling out a technology called Rich Communications Service, or RCS, to its iMessage app. The technology should improve the quality and security of texting between iPhones and devices powered by Android software, such as the Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel.. In another upcoming change to the iPhone’s messaging app, users will be able to write a text (or have an AI tool compose it) in advance and schedule a specific time to automatically send it.. And Apple is introducing a series of animated tap backs to allow users to instantly reply with any emoji or sticker, giving its app abilities similar to other messaging platforms like Google Chat or WhatsApp.. Apple's new AI platform, dubbed ""Apple Intelligence,"" will use Siri to help carry out actions between apps and boost the assistant's range of capabilities. AI can also help manage and prioritize notifications, and summarize text in searches, email and other apps. There will be functions that can help you write text and change the tone of it as well, similar to other popular gen AI platforms.. But the tech firm is trying hard to convince consumers that the iPhone won’t be used to spy on them. Apple is harnessing its chip technology so most of its AI-powered features are handled on the device itself instead of at remote data centers, often called “the cloud,” thus keeping users data local.. When Apple users make AI demands that requiring computing power beyond what’s available on the device, the tasks will be handled by what the company is calling a “private cloud” that is supposed to shield their personal data.. iPhone users will have more options to arrange apps, resize icons and widgets on the home screen when iOS 18 arrives. A new dark mode look and tinting effect will also be available for further customization.. The control center has also been redesigned to give users access to more one tap functions, and the ability to add some third-party app options — such as remote starting your car — to it. . All of Apple's platforms — iPhone, iPad, Mac and Vision Pro — are getting a new dedicated Passwords app.. The new app lets you access all of your passwords in one place, including Wi-Fi passwords, and allow you to access some authentication tools. Apple also claims the app will alert you when certain passwords are compromised.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,GOP women who helped defeat a near-total abortion ban are losing reelection in South Carolina,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/gop-women-helped-defeat-total-abortion-ban-losing-111068761,2024-06-12 17:18:16,"A near-total abortion ban was defeated in South Carolina with the help of the only three Republican women in the Senate, and now they’re losing their election bids. COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A near-total abortion ban was defeated in South Carolina with the help of the only three Republican women in the Senate, but after Tuesday’s primary, they’re losing their election bids.. Voters handed the senators – and winners of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage award for people who risk their careers for the greater good – two losses and a runoff after they joined with Democratic women to defeat the measure, saying a pregnant woman shouldn’t lose control of her body as soon as an egg is fertilized.. But the state had only men in the Senate in 2012 and may end up without a single Republican woman in the chamber in 2025. There are just two Democratic women among the 46 members.. “You can’t tell me that’s not a slap in the face of women,” said Sen. Katrina Shealy who is gearing up for a runoff. “Republican women lose like this over one issue when we fought so hard for other things.”. Voters on Tuesday went against a trend of having second thoughts about more restrictive abortion law. . Statewide polling has indicated a near total ban doesn’t have wide support. But turnout was low and races were in Republican-drawn districts, where experts say voters tend to be more fervent about issues like abortion.. The Republican women had forced a compromise, and the state eventually implemented a ban once cardiac activity is detected, typically around six weeks after conception.. “It’s easier to fight mini battles than it is to take on a whole statewide war,” said Dave Wilson, a conservative political consultant who has worked with groups opposing abortion. “In the mini battles, voters can turn around and say they aren’t happy with the stance you took and the way you went about it. It doesn’t take a lot of them.”. Abortion wasn’t the only reason Penry Gustafson lost, said her sole opponent, Allen Blackman, who believes life begins at conception. Gustafson had less than 20% of the vote in a freshly redrawn district that no longer included her base, and where constituents complained she didn’t solve their problems.. Sen. Sandy Senn’s loss by just 31 votes to state Rep. Matt Leber is close enough for a recount, but those rarely alter a race by more than a few votes in South Carolina. The race was fraught with accusations. She posted signs with Leber’s mugshot, which he said were from inflated accusations that never led to convictions.. Leber’s attacks misconstrued Senn’s record and manipulated photos to make her look like the Joker, a DC Comics villain.. Redistricting may have hurt Senn too; her redrawn Charleston district includes more conservatives.. Gustafson thanked her supporters in a Wednesday statement, promising to continue serving the community. Senn isn't going to talk about the race until the recount is finished later this week, she said in an email. Neither woman mentioned abortion.. Leber did not responded to messages.. Shealy was the only Republican woman to survive the night, but she got just 40% of the vote. She will face attorney and political newcomer Carlisle Kennedy in the June 25 runoff.. Billboards saying Shealy was not “pro-life” were all over her district in Lexington County, which led the charge to flip the state from Democratic to Republican control over the past five decades. Kennedy did not respond to messages Wednesday.. Shealy’s strategy for the primary was to stay above the fray. She will likely change tactics for the runoff, even if that alienates people uncomfortable when a woman raises her voice or takes a stand, she said Wednesday.. South Carolina’s Senate had been all-male for four years when Shealy was first elected in 2012 and rarely had more than one woman in the chamber. If she loses, there is a very good chance the Senate in 2025 will have just two women, both Democrats.. That means the perspective of women, who make up 55% of the registered voters in South Carolina, can get lost and issues she champions like free lunch for all schoolchildren may be ignored, she said.. “I broke that ceiling not for abortion rights — I broke it because we needed someone to care about children and families and veterans and old people,” Shealy said. “All these people no one was taking care of. I came in there and gave them a voice.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

ABUJA, Nigeria -- Traces of highly potent opioids known as nitazenes have for the first time been found to be consumed by people who use drugs in Africa, according to a report released Wednesday by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, a nonprofit organization.. Nitazenes, powerful synthetic opioids, have long been in use in Western countries as well as in Asia where they have been associated with overdose deaths. Some of them can be up to 100 times more potent than heroin and up to 10 times more potent than fentanyl, meaning that users can get an effect from a much smaller amount, putting them at increased risk of overdose and death. . The report focused on Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau and is based on chemical testing of kush, a derivative of cannabis mixed with synthetic drugs like fentanyl and tramadol and chemicals like formaldehyde. Researchers found that in Sierra Leone, 83% of the samples were found to contain nitazenes, while in Guinea-Bissau it was identified in 55%. . “The GI-TOC ( Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime) believes that these results are the first indication that nitazenes have penetrated retail drug markets in Africa,” the report said.. Many young people in West and Central Africa have become addicted to drugs with between 5.2% and 13.5% using cannabis, the most widely used illicit substance on the continent, according to the World Health Organization.. In Sierra Leone where kush is one of the most widely consumed drugs, President Julius Maada Bio this year declared war on the substance, calling it an epidemic and a national threat.. Nitazenes have been detected repeatedly in substances sold to young people in the region such that users are most likely ingesting them ""without knowing the risks they face,” Wednesday's report said.. The authors said their findings suggest that nitazenes are being imported into Sierra Leone from elsewhere and that the substance being sold as kush in Guinea-Bissau was of similar chemical composition to that found in Freetown.. Officials in the two countries must deploy chemical testing equipment as a first step in tackling drug abuse, the report said. “Without this, it is impossible for the government of Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and the wider subregion to accurately monitor the countries’ illicit drug markets and develop evidence-based responses,” it said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

If you’ve been sick with COVID-19, you may have some protection against certain versions of the common cold.. A new study suggests previous COVID-19 infections lower the risk of getting colds caused by milder coronavirus cousins, which could provide a key to broader COVID-19 vaccines.. “We think there’s going to be a future outbreak of a coronavirus,” said Dr. Manish Sagar, senior author of the study published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. “Vaccines potentially could be improved if we could replicate some of the immune responses that are provided by natural infection.”. The study looked at COVID-19 PCR tests from more than 4,900 people who sought medical care between November 2020 and October 2021. After controlling for things like age, gender and preexisting conditions, Sagar said he and his colleagues found people previously infected with COVID-19 had about a 50% lower chance of having a symptomatic coronavirus-caused common cold compared with people who were, at the time, fully vaccinated and hadn't yet gotten COVID-19. . Several viruses cause colds; coronaviruses are thought to be responsible for about 1 in 5 colds.. Researchers linked the protection against coronavirus-caused colds to virus-killing cell responses for two specific viral proteins. These proteins aren’t used in most vaccines now, but researchers propose adding them in the future.. “Our studies would suggest that these may be novel strategies for better vaccines that not only tackle the current coronaviruses, but any potential future one that may emerge,” said Sagar of Boston Medical Center.. Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas who was not involved in the study, said the findings shouldn’t be seen as a knock against current vaccines, which target the “spike” protein studding the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. . These vaccines, he said, are “still your best defense against severe COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death.”. But he added: “If we can find targets that cross-protect among multiple viruses, we can either add those to specific vaccines or start to use those as vaccine targets that would give us broader-based immunity from a single vaccination.

abcnews.com,A 98-year-old man's liver was donated. He is believed to be the oldest American organ donor ever,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/98-year-mans-liver-donated-believed-oldest-american-111061122,2024-06-12 15:50:17,"Transplant organizations say a 98-year-old man may be the oldest American to ever donate an organ. ST. LOUIS -- Orville Allen lived a lifetime of service, and when he died at age 98 he had one last thing to give: his liver.. Allen, a veteran of both World War II and the Korean War and a longtime educator in rural southeastern Missouri, is the oldest American to ever donate an organ, transplant organizations said. He died on May 29 and his liver was successfully transplanted to a 72-year-old woman, according to Mid-America Transplant.. Allen was in robust health until he suffered a fall while picking up storm debris at his home in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, on May 27, his daughter, Linda Mitchelle said. He struck the back of his head and was flown to St. Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau.. Swelling around Allen's brain couldn't be healed. As the family was preparing to say goodbye, hospital staff had a question: Would they consider donating his liver?. Given Allen's age, it was a question that caught the relatives by surprise. But surgeons had examined him and determined the organ was acceptable for transplant.. Knowing their dad's nature — always the first to check in on people, always at the doorstep of a needy neighbor — the siblings didn't hesitate.. “It turned it from being such a sad loss of our dad to having this little ray of joy because he was doing what he'd done all his life,” Mitchelle said. “He was giving one more gift.”. Previously, Cecil Lockhart of West Virginia was the oldest person to donate an organ upon death, according to the Center for Organ Recovery & Education, which coordinated recovery of his liver. He was 95 when he died in 2021, and his liver was successfully transplanted to a woman.. More people than ever are getting new organs, according to data from the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, a nonprofit organization that has run the transplant system under a government contract for nearly four decades. Last year was a record year for donations from the deceased — more than 16,000 — and for the number of organ transplants performed — more than 46,000 — according to UNOS. Liver transplants topped 10,000 for the first time ever.. Still, more than 100,000 people are on the nation’s list for a new organ and many will die waiting. The need is so great that scientists are working on alternatives to ease the ongoing shortages. Earlier this year in Massachusetts, Richard “Rick” Slayman became the first recipient of a genetically modified pig kidney. He died two months after the transplant.. Increasingly, older adults can donate organs upon their death, said Kevin Lee, president and CEO of Mid-America Transplant.. “As we’ve seen advances in medical science, we have been educating over the past five years nurses and hospital staff not to think about age when they call in those referrals, but really allow our medical team and transplant physicians to evaluate the medical eligibility of each individual,” Lee said.. Two years ago, a liver was procured from a 90-year-old donor in Mid-America's region, which includes eastern Missouri, southern Illinois and northeastern Arkansas, Lee said. Last fall, livers were donated by an 88-year-old and an 84-year-old.. The liver “is resilient. We see liver donations at all ages,” Lee said.. About 12% of deceased organ donors in the first four months of this year were people age 65 or older, UNOS spokeswoman Anne Paschke said.. “Organ donation at advanced ages can be successful and provide life-saving benefits for the recipients,” Dr. David Klassen, chief medical officer for UNOS, said in a statement. But the impact of aging varies by organ, he said. In fact, many transplant centers won’t consider hearts from senior donors.. Allen was a lifelong resident of southeast Missouri. He was a pilot in the Army Air Corps in World War II, then served in artillery communications in the Army 1st Cavalry Division in the Korean War. After the wars, he spent 27 years in the Army Reserve, retiring as a lieutenant colonel.. He also farmed and taught vocational agriculture at Neelyville High School, near Poplar Bluff, for nearly four decades. He and his wife of 70 years, Geraldine, who died in 2019, had three children, three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.. He never got around to signing up to be an organ donor, but the family said they hope his story spurs more people to register.. In fact, they said, it already has.. “A whole bunch of people at the visitation and funeral who were former students and friends said, ‘You know what? I’m going to put donor on my driver’s license right now,’” Mitchelle said.. Greg Allen, one of Orville's sons, said the ability to donate their dad's organ was uplifting in an otherwise sad time.. “To me, it's just a wonderful thing to be able to help somebody else, anybody else, to extend their life for their family,” Greg Allen said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Denmark recalls spicy South Korean noodles over health concerns,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/denmark-recalls-3-spicy-instant-noodle-soup-brands-111058767,2024-06-13 03:34:19,"Food authorities in Denmark have recalled three types of spicy instant noodle products imported from South Korea over possible risks for “acute poisoning.”. COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Food authorities in Denmark have recalled three types of spicy instant noodle products imported from South Korea over possible risks for “acute poisoning.” Consumers are asked to discard them or return the noodles to the retailer.. The noodles are made by Seoul-based Samyang Foods, one of South Korea’s largest companies, and sold across the globe. The recalled noodles include Buldak Samyang 3 x Spicy & Hot Chicken, Buldak Samyang 2 x Spicy & Hot Chicken and Buldak Samyang Hot Chicken Stew. . The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said the products contain an overly high dose of capsaicin, an active ingredient in chile peppers but also a chemical that can be a neurotoxin and a health hazard.. Children and teenagers in Denmark have been daring each other on social media to eat “a strong bowl of noodle soup,” referring to the three South Korean products, the agency said. . “The noodle dishes marketed as extremely strong must no longer be sold because consumers and especially children risk acute poisoning,” it said late Tuesday. ""The capsaicin content is so high that it can pose a health hazard.”. Children and frail adults and the elderly are at risk, said Henrik Dammand Nielsen of the Danish Food and Drug Administration. Possibly symptoms include burning and discomfort, nausea, vomiting and high blood pressure, he said.. “That is why we are now demanding shops remove the products from their shelves,” the agency said.. In a statement to reporters, Samyang said it understands that the steps taken in Denmark were not based on product quality issues but because local authorities thought “they were too spicy and could potentially cause problems.”. The company said the same noodles are exported worldwide but it was the first time they were ordered to recall them in any market.. “We will closely study local regulations while responding to this recall measure,” the company said.. Spicy food challenges have been around for years. From local chile pepper eating contests to restaurant walls of fame for those who finished extra hot dishes, people around the world have been daring each other to eat especially fiery foods.. In September, a Massachusetts teen with a congenital heart defect who participated in a spicy tortilla chip challenge on social media died from eating a large quantity of chile pepper extract. An autopsy report obtained by The Associated Press showed that the 10th grader died on Sept. 1, 2023, after eating the Paqui chip as part of the manufacturer’s “One Chip Challenge.” . In Denmark, a puzzled consumer reached out to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration and asked how the instant noodles could be legal, the agency said, after which it had a lab assessing the products and determined the three noodle brands can be harmful to health, instigating the recall.. ""It is important that parents are aware of the extreme noodle varieties and avoid them, Dammand Nielsen said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Senators blast health and law enforcement officials over illegal e-cigarettes used by teens,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/senate-hearing-spotlight-illegal-vaping-companies-dodged-regulators-111054314,2024-06-12 17:02:26,"Senators criticized top federal officials over the rise of illegal electronic cigarettes in the U.S., a multibillion-dollar business that has flourished in recent years. WASHINGTON -- Senators on Wednesday blasted top health and law enforcement officials for not doing more to combat the rise of illegal electronic cigarettes in the U.S., a multibillion-dollar business that has flourished amid haphazard enforcement.. Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee expressed frustration and exasperation while questioning officials from the Food and Drug Administration and Justice Department about attempts to stay on top of the vaping industry, which has grown to include thousands of flavored, unauthorized e-cigarettes originating in China.. Those products, including brands like Elf Bar, have become the most popular choice among American teens who vape.. “I simply do not understand how FDA and DOJ have permitted thousands of products to remain on store shelves when their manufacturers have not received authorization, or, in some cases, even filed an application,” said the committee's chairman, Dick Durbin.. The Illinois Democrat displayed a photo of a shelf stocked with brightly colored e-cigarettes, including ones in dragon fruit and watermelon bubblegum flavors, which he said a Senate staffer took at a vape shop near the FDA's Maryland campus.. “These illegal products, clearly designed for children by their flavors, are being sold in the shadow of FDA’s building,"" Durbin said. ""How is that allowed to happen?”. FDA's tobacco chief, Brian King, said the agency has been slowed by a backlog of applications submitted by vape companies seeking U.S. approval, which regulators are legally required to review.. “The sheer volume of this product landscape requires that we take the time to conduct scientifically and legally defensible reviews of the 27 million applications,” King said.. The FDA has OK’d a handful of e-cigarettes as alternatives for adult smokers. All other products on the market, including major sellers like Juul, are pending review or considered illegal by regulators.. An industry lobbyist told the committee that the FDA has created an untenable marketplace by rejecting more than 99% of applications submitted by companies.. Lawmakers also heard from a high school senior who said she became addicted to nicotine after trying a “blueberry ice” vape in ninth grade.. “I thought I was just enjoying the flavors but soon my 14-year-old brain craved the nicotine more and more,” said Josie Shapiro of Seattle. “I’ve tried to quit vaping over and over again, but it’s really, really hard.”. The FDA and DOJ have legally barred about a half-dozen vaping companies for selling products that can appeal to youngsters, but many more manufacturers continue launching new products, primarily disposable vapes that can’t be refilled and are thrown in the trash.. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Arun Rao told senators that regulators at the Justice Department and other agencies have signaled that the vaping issue “is a priority across the executive branch.”. “I'm against signals,” Durbin said. “Do something!”. On Monday, the FDA and DOJ announced a new government task force, which will include the U.S. Postal Service and other agencies, to try and tackle the problem. That step was recommended in 2022 by an outside panel that reviewed longstanding complaints about the FDA’s tobacco program.. Republican Senator Thom Tillis called the timing of the announcement “a political stunt,” and criticized the absence of other federal agencies from the initiative, including Customs and Border Protection.. “If the timing of the task force formation wasn’t evidence of how unserious the FDA is about tackling the flood of illicit e-cigarettes, FDA’s exclusion of CBP from the task force makes it crystal clear,” said Tillis, who represents North Carolina, the nation's leading tobacco producer. He urged officials to concentrate enforcement on Chinese brands, rather than large domestic manufacturers like Reynolds American.. The FDA can conduct investigations and recommend cases, but only the Justice Department can bring lawsuits. Federal prosecutors may decline to pursue cases for any number of reasons, including competing priorities, weaknesses in the case or the potential repercussions of losing in court.. Using its own authorities, the FDA has sent hundreds of warning letters to vape shops and e-cigarette manufacturers in recent years. But the letters have done little to dissuade companies from flouting FDA rules and introducing new vapes.. Industry analysts estimate disposable vapes make up 30% to 40% of the roughly $7 billion-dollar vaping market. The two best-selling disposables — Breeze and Elf Bar — generated more than $500 million in sales last year, according to Nielsen retail sales data analyzed by Goldman Sachs.. Both brands have been sanctioned by FDA regulators but remain widely available, in some cases with new names, logos and flavors. More than half of the 2.8 million U.S. teens and adolescents who vaped last year said they used Elf Bar.. King noted that products like Elf Bar cannot legally be sold in China because the government there has banned non-tobacco flavored e-cigarettes.. “You can’t sell them in China but you can sell them in the United States?” Sen. John Cornyn of Texas responded. The Republican vowed to introduce legislation addressing what he called “an outrageous and unacceptable status quo.” . Overall, teen vaping has fallen 60% since its all-time high in 2019, following the COVID-19 pandemic and new age restrictions and flavor bans on e-cigarettes and other tobacco products.. ___.

abcnews.com,"With 1 out of 3 Californians on Medicaid, doctors push ballot measure to force state to pay more",https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/1-3-californians-medicaid-doctors-push-ballot-measure-111045103,2024-06-12 00:30:28,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to back out of a deal he made last year to pay doctors more money to treat Medicaid patients. SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom last year agreed to a tax increase that aimed to do two things: Help balance a budget with a multibillion-dollar shortfall, and pay doctors more money to treat patients covered by Medicaid — the taxpayer-funded health insurance program for people with low incomes that now covers one out of every three people in the state. . A year later, California is relying on this tax more than ever. Newsom raised it again in March to help cover another multibillion-dollar shortfall this year. And he's proposing to raise it a third time to generate even more money as the deficit has continued to grow.. But many of the doctors who were supposed to see an increase in their Medicaid rates haven't gotten it yet. Now, citing the budget deficit, Newsom wants to back out of the agreement he made with doctors last year that would have used about $5.4 billion from the tax to increase their rates starting in January 2025.. Newsom's proposal was no surprise to California's medical community, who have seen the state raise their rates before, only to backtrack later during an economic downturn. But doctors have something this year they haven't had in the past: Leverage. Last week, they qualified a measure to appear on the November ballot that would force the state to pay them more for treating Medicaid patients. . If approved by voters, doctors would get their raise no matter what Newsom and the state Legislature decides.. “I’ve been around long enough to live through promises kept, promises broken,” said Dustin Corcoran, CEO of the California Medical Association, which supports the ballot measure. ""The ballot measure changes that calculation for every provider in the state.”. It’s the latest example of budgeting by the ballot box in California, where the initiative process gives frustrated interest groups a way to bypass the state Legislature. Voter-approved laws in California already require the state to sometimes return a portion of budget surpluses to taxpayers and ensure lawmakers spend about 40% of the budget on public education each year. Another also threatens to withhold legislators’ salaries if they don’t pass a budget by June 15 each year.. These measures, while popular with voters, can leave lawmakers with fewer options when trying to either close a budget deficit or prepare for one in the future. It’s one reason why Newsom administration officials have had conversations with doctors about withdrawing this latest measure from the ballot, according to Corcoran. The deadline to do that is June 27.. The state Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, has their own proposal that would delay the rate increases by one year instead of eliminating them entirely. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a doctor, said it would keep the state's promise to raise rates while convincing more doctors to accept Medicaid, but John Baackes, CEO of the L.A. Care Health Plan, said the Legislature's proposal is “a nice gesture, but all it does is kick the can down the road.”. “Everyone's really despondent that the state will never get Medicaid reimbursement to where it should be,” he said.. The health care tax applies to managed care organizations that contract with the state to administer Medicaid benefits. For the most part, such groups welcome the tax because it triggers more money from the federal government.. California's Medicaid population has grown in recent years now that low-income people are eligible for the program regardless of their immigration status. Newsom has vowed to protect that expansion. It's one reason he's proposed for backing out of the deal to pay doctors more for treating Medicaid patients, saying the money is better spent to make sure California doesn't have to cut benefits to balance the budget, according to H.D. Palmer, spokesperson for the California Department of Finance.. But many Medicaid patients are having a hard time finding doctors that will treat them, mostly because they don't get paid much to do it. It's especially true when needing to see a specialist, where a lengthy delay can often transform a minor medical problem into a major one, said Dr. Ilan Shapiro, chief health correspondent and medical affairs officer for AltaMed Health in Los Angeles. . “It takes awhile to get someone to actually see the patients, sometimes months,” he said. . Corcoran says the ballot measure, if approved, would convince more doctors to accept Medicaid patients because they would know that, this time, the rate increases would stick.. “The first question shouldn’t be, ‘Are you on commercial insurance or are you on Medicaid?’ when you’re trying to get an appointment,” he said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Cooking and coughing: Respiratory diseases plague Kenya as more people burn wood to save money,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/cooking-coughing-respiratory-diseases-plague-kenya-people-burn-111044739,2024-06-12 07:34:18,"In Kenya's capital, a woman cooking with firewood engulfs herself in smoke as she heats herself some tea. NAIROBI, Kenya -- Piles of firewood surrounded Jane Muthoni in her kitchen made of iron sheets. The roof, walls and wooden pillars were covered in soot. As she blew on the flame for tea, the 65-year-old was engulfed in smoke.. “I’ve used firewood all my life,"" she said. “Sometimes I usually cough from inhaling the smoke, and my eyes itch, but there’s nothing I can do about it. I don’t have money to even buy charcoal.”. She was unaware of the lasting toll on her health. But experts are.. Respiratory diseases have been the most prevalent diseases in Kenya for the past several years and are on the rise, according to government authorities, with 19.6 million reported cases last year.. Burning biomass such as firewood is the largest contributor to those diseases, said Evans Amukoye, a scientist with the Kenya Medical Research Institute's respiratory diseases research center.. “One can have itchy eyes, coughs while inhaling the smoke, and for serious cases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, you find that you cannot walk as your lungs have become tight,” Amukoye said. The disease is caused by indoor or outdoor air pollution or smoking.. Data from Kenya’s health ministry shows that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is responsible for 1.7% of deaths in the country.. People in low-income areas are diagnosed with respiratory diseases later in life compared to middle-class people in urban areas with better awareness and access to health care, Amukoye said.. Families in informal neighborhoods and rural areas are the most affected as most people rely on firewood or fossil fuels for cooking. Women hunched over a smoking fire at stalls for tea or snacks is a common sight in the capital, Nairobi, and beyond.. The government's 2022 Demographic and Health Survey showed a high dependence on traditional fuels for cooking in Kenya. The number of households relying on biomass like firewood increased from 4.7 million to 6.7 million between 2020 and 2022.. Economist Abraham Muriu said he believes the increase in Kenyans using firewood is a result of economic shocks caused by reduced incomes during the COVID pandemic and ongoing high inflation.. “Firewood is readily available and the most accessible fossil fuel, especially in rural areas,"" Muriu said.. He said more Kenyans in urban areas have likely resorted to using firewood or charcoal, too, as prices and taxes rise. Blackened sacks of charcoal are openly on sale at some Nairobi intersections, and the hunt for firewood across the country is constant.. Mercy Letting, 33, a businesswoman in Nairobi’s Kasarani neighborhood was using charcoal to make meals for customers in the first six months after opening her restaurant early last year. With time, it affected her health.. “I am asthmatic, so whenever I used charcoal to cook the smoke would always trigger an attack, forcing me to spend part of my daily earnings on medication. This happened five times,"" she said.. She found it expensive, spending 4,500 Kenyan shillings ($33) per month to buy a sack of charcoal. ""I eventually had to buy an ‘eco-friendly’ cooker, which has been great for my health and good for business.” It requires less charcoal.. Letting also bought an induction burner, which she said is faster in cooking and more efficient as she spends only 50 Kenyan shillings ($0.38) per day on electricity.. Although companies pursue “clean cooking” options, high prices remain an obstacle to many Kenyans.. “If we want to deliver a truly clean and efficient solution to users across Africa, it needs to be affordable for them,"" said Chris McKinney, the chief commercial officer at BURN Manufacturing, which describes itself as a “modern cookstove” company based on the outskirts of Nairobi.. “This has been the key barrier to scaling for us,” he said.. ___.

abcnews.com,Gov. Jay Inslee says Washington will make clear that hospitals must provide emergency abortions,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/gov-jay-inslee-washington-make-clear-hospitals-provide-111038467,2024-06-11 18:22:24,"Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday said Washington will spell out in state law that hospitals must provide abortions if needed to stabilize patients, a step that comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on whether conservative .... SEATTLE -- Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday said Washington will spell out in state law that hospitals must provide abortions if needed to stabilize patients, a step that comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on whether conservative states can bar abortions during some medical emergencies.. There is no indication that patients have been denied emergency abortions in Washington, but the Democrat said during a news conference in Seattle he wanted to remove any doubt that hospitals were required to provide those services if necessary.. “This is a preventative against the Supreme Court decision,” Inslee said. “If your health is going to be damaged in any way as a result of not getting emergency services, you ought to have that right to get those emergency services."". Most Republican-controlled states have imposed restrictions on abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, eliminating the right to terminate a pregnancy under federal law. Fourteen have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy with limited exceptions.. Among them is Idaho, which bans abortion except in life-threatening situations, with doctors subject to felony charges and up to five years in prison for violations. The Biden administration sued to block Idaho's ban, arguing that federal law requires hospitals that accept Medicare to provide emergency abortions when a patient's health is threatened, though not necessarily their life.. The Supreme Court has allowed Idaho's ban to go into effect as it considers the case, with a ruling expected by the end of this month.. Most Democratic-controlled states have adopted laws or issued executive orders seeking to protect abortion access, including Washington, which stocked a three-year supply of abortion medication in case federal court rulings limit its availability. . Washington has also increased funding for reproductive care clinics, barred the State Patrol from cooperating with out-of-state abortion investigations, and adopted a shield law to protect patients who obtain abortions in Washington from extradited to face charges in another state.. Abortion rights advocates say the bans have already affected the emergency care provided to pregnant women. More women whose conditions are typically treated with abortions must now be flown out of state for care, since doctors must wait until they are close to death to provide terminations within the bounds of state law.. Washington's administrative code says hospitals must provide emergency services to patients, but so far does not say specifically that includes emergency abortions. Inslee directed the state Department of Health to change that.. “Washington state hospitals are already required by state law to provide emergency care to people experiencing these types of pregnancy complications,” the Washington State Hospital Association said in a written statement Tuesday. “Washington hospitals are providing this care, including to people who have crossed the border from Idaho in need of care.”. The number of women coming to Washington from out of state for abortions since the Supreme Court overturned Roe has jumped by 50%, Inslee said.. Dr. Sarah Prager, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington, said Tuesday she has treated patients who have traveled to Washington in the past two years after they were unable to obtain care at home — including one with a preterm rupture of membranes and infected uterus, another with a complicated ectopic pregnancy that was about to burst, and a third who was bleeding from an incomplete miscarriage.. “When I or any doctor has a sick patient in front of me, I shouldn't have to pause and consult with the hospital's legal team to figure out if I'm able to act,” Prager said. “These moments wasted can cost patients their health, their future fertility and even their life.”. Abortion opponents say doctors have mishandled maternal emergency cases and argue that the Biden administration has overstated the danger to undermine state abortion bans.. “We want the highest standard of care for women, and we do make an exception for abortion to save the life of the mother,"" including in cases of ectopic pregnancy, said Esther Ripplinger, president of Human Life of Washington. “But when you say ‘health’ is threatened — that's an interesting proposal, because now, ‘health’ can mean, 'Oh, I've got a headache, I need an abortion.' ... We need to be very specific about what is that emergency and what is not.”. ___.

abcnews.com,North Carolina lawmakers approve mask bill that allows health exemption after pushback,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/north-carolina-lawmakers-approve-mask-bill-allows-health-111038466,2024-06-11 18:22:24,"A reworked version of a bill that originally caught flak for removing a pandemic-era health exemption for wearing a mask in public has been approved by North Carolina lawmakers. RALEIGH, N.C. -- A new, reworked version of a bill that originally caught flak for removing a pandemic-era health exemption for wearing a mask in public was approved by North Carolina lawmakers on Tuesday.. The amended bill still increases punishments for people wearing masks while committing a crime. It was brought forth in part as a response to campus protests on the war in Gaza. The previous version of the bill would have also barred masking in public for health reasons.. Following extended debate from Democrats, the General Assembly passed the measure in a 69-43 vote. The state Senate passed the compromise bill last week. It now heads to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's desk.. The legislation — which previously removed a 2020 exemption for wearing a mask in public for health purposes — moved swiftly through the Senate last month. But it halted in the House after Rep. Erin Pare, Wake County’s lone Republican General Assembly member, said she wouldn’t approve it because of the health exemption removal. Republicans have a narrow supermajority in the legislature that requires all party members to remain in lockstep to approve bills and override vetoes. . The House then sent the bill back to a committee of GOP lawmakers to negotiate changes. They reached a deal on the bill last week. . The measure added language that allows people to wear “medical or surgical grade masks"" to prevent spreading illnesses. It also allows law enforcement and property owners to ask someone to temporarily remove their mask for identification. . “Basically, you can wear a mask for health and safety if you're not planning on breaking the law,” said Gaston County Republican Rep. John Torbett, one of the bill's sponsors.. Another new component could make it easier for wealthy donors to attempt to influence this fall’s elections without facing more direct scrutiny. . The bill would allow 527s — a special kind of political organization named after its location within the IRS code — and other federal committees to donate money to state political party committees that come from accounts through which the 527s and federal committees can receive unlimited contributions from individuals.. State Republican lawmakers contend a 2020 State Board of Elections advisory opinion that affirmed campaign giving limits had hamstrung groups like the Republican Governors Association from helping the state GOP. Iredell County Republican Rep. Grey Mills said on the House floor that it would make the process of making political contributions “equal and balanced for both parties.”. But the crux of the original legislation still remains, focusing on increasing punishments for people who wear masks while committing crimes or blocking traffic while protesting. It makes sentencing for an offense one class higher than it would have been if the person didn't wear a mask. . The bill's GOP supporters cited a need for the legislation last month as a partial response to nationwide use of masks during a wave of campus protests, including at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, against Israel's war in Gaza.. The bill is a retaliatory attack on pro-Palestinian demonstrators who deserve a right to privacy, Shruti Parikh, political engagement head at the North Carolina Asian Americans Together, said at a Tuesday morning news conference by a coalition of social advocacy groups. . “It is imperative on the people that we are able to exercise our right to peacefully protest,” said Dawn Blagrove, executive director of criminal justice organization Emancipate NC. . The campaign finance provision did not get as much attention at the news conference as it did from Democrats on the House floor who repeatedly blasted the change for being rushed and creating a further lack of transparency.. “It is insane that a country as wealthy as we are, a country that prides itself on being a democracy has let money make a sham of what we purport is a democracy, ” House Democratic Leader Rep. Robert Reives said during debate.. Cooper also opposes the provision, his spokesperson Jordan Monaghan said in a statement, but the governor's office did not confirm if Cooper plans to veto.. ——.

TUCSON, Ariz. -- Linguist, activist and social critic Noam Chomsky is hospitalized in his wife's native country of Brazil recovering from a massive stroke he had a year ago, she confirmed Tuesday. . Valeria Chomsky said via email that her 95-year-old husband is in a Sao Paulo hospital, where she took him on an ambulance jet with two nurses once he could more easily travel from the United States following the June 2023 stroke. The couple has had a residence there since 2015. . She confirmed the details of a Monday report in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, which said her husband has difficulty speaking and the right side of his body is affected.

Valeria Chomsky told the newspaper that her husband follows the news and when he sees images of the war in Gaza, he raises his left arm in a gesture of lament and anger. . Noam Chomsky, seen by many around the world as a symbol of protest and independence, is an influential activist and critic who has frequently challenged U.S. policy on everything from the Middle East to Central America, as well as what he considers a compliant media. His books and essays are read and discussed by millions.. Chomsky was a longtime faculty member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2017 he joined the College of Social & Behavioral Sciences at the University of Arizona in Tucson, where he is currently listed as Laureate Professor of Linguistics, Agnese Helms Haury Chair. . He transformed the study of linguistics with his landmark 1957 book, “Syntactic Structures,” in which he wrote that humans do not simply learn language but are born with an innate ability that explains how they can formulate and understand sentences never seen or heard before. . Valeria Chomsky also told Folha de S.Paulo that she is thinking about moving to an apartment near the beach in Rio de Janeiro after reading that living in a sunny place can help stroke patients. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

The Biden administration is pushing to prevent medical debt from being considered in most decisions made over whether someone qualifies to rent an apartment, buy a car or take on a mortgage.. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Tuesday it is planning a rule that would remove medical bills from credit reports and prevent lenders from making decisions based on medical information.. The proposed rule also would prevent lenders from repossessing medical devices like wheelchairs if people cannot repay a loan.. “No one should be denied access to economic opportunity simply because they experienced a medical emergency,” Vice President Kamala Harris said during a conference call laying out the planned rule.. The administration announced plans for the rule in September, and a senior administration official said they expect to finalize it early next year.. The CFPB has said that medical debt can be a poor predictor of whether someone is likely to repay a loan. Those expenses often are not planned like a car or home purchase, and patients may have little control over the progress of a serious illness.. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra also noted Tuesday that research shows billing errors frequently appear on credit reports. He said the rule would prevent debt collectors “from using the credit report as a cudgel” to force people to pay bills they may not owe.. The three national credit reporting agencies — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — said last year that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.. But the CFPB said Tuesday that even with that change, 15 million people still have $49 billion in outstanding medical bills in collections appearing in the credit reporting system.. The CFPB will take comments or feedback on its proposed rule until August 12.. ___.

The Biden administration is taking credit for a sharp drop in violent crime nationwide earlier this year but one expert cautions that the declines in FBI data are preliminary and likely overstated.. The data show steep drops in every category of violent crime in every region in the first three months of 2024 compared to a year earlier, continuing a downward trend since a coronavirus pandemic surge.. Murder and rape were both down 26%, robbery was down 18%, and aggravated assault fell by 13% in the first quarter. Overall violent crime was down 15%, reflecting drops in every region, from 10% in the West to 19% in the Midwest, according to the FBI data released Monday.. Property crime meanwhile decreased by 15%, according to the data trumpeted by President Joe Biden in a statement.. “My administration is putting more cops on the beat, holding violent criminals accountable and getting illegal guns off the street — and we are doing it in partnership with communities. As a result, Americans are safer today than when I took office,” Biden said.. The declines were consistent with previous reports showing improvement since crime surged during the coronavirus pandemic. But a crime data analyst was skeptical the latest declines were quite so steep.. Violent crime almost certainly did fall earlier this year but the FBI almost certainly overstated by how much, Jeff Asher with the data consulting firm AH Datalytics wrote in an online post.. The preliminary data for 77% of the U.S. population is prone to reporting errors, which law enforcement agencies have months to correct before making final submissions, Asher noted.. The declining trend is likely correct but other data show different rates of declining violent crime by city and even a slight increase in violent crime in New York in the first three months of 2024, Asher wrote.. “I would urge strong caution into reading too much into the raw percent changes and focus on the overarching picture. Almost all crime data is imperfect and the quarterly data adds an important imperfect piece to the national crime trend jigsaw puzzle,” Asher wrote.. In 2020, homicides surged 29% for the biggest one-year jump in FBI records. Experts suggested the massive disruption of the pandemic, gun violence, worries about the economy and intense stress were to blame.. Violent crime fell back to near pre-pandemic levels in 2022 and dropped further in 2023.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,A Florida law blocking treatment for transgender children is thrown out by a federal judge,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/florida-law-blocking-treatment-transgender-children-thrown-federal-111031246,2024-06-11 17:34:38,"A federal judge has struck down as unconstitutional a 2023 Florida law that blocked gender-affirming care for transgender minors and severely restricted such treatment for adults. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A federal judge on Tuesday struck down a 2023 Florida law that blocked gender-affirming care for transgender minors and severely restricted such treatment for adults, calling the statute unconstitutional. . Senior Judge Robert Hinkle said the state went too far when it barred transgender minors from being prescribed puberty blockers and hormonal treatments with their parents' permission. He also stopped the state from requiring that transgender adults only receive treatment from a doctor and not from a registered nurse or other qualified medical practitioner. And he barred a ban on online treatment for transgender adults.. Hinkle said transgender people are constitutionally entitled to the legitimate treatment they need and, quoting the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., compared those who oppose it to those who were once against equality for minorities and women.. “Some transgender opponents invoke religion to support their position, just as some once invoked religion to support their racism or misogyny,” Hinkle wrote in his 105-page decision. “Transgender opponents are of course free to hold their beliefs. But they are not free to discriminate against transgender individuals just for being transgender. . “In time, discrimination against transgender individuals will diminish, just as racism and misogyny have diminished,” he continued. ""To paraphrase a civil-rights advocate from an earlier time, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blasted Hinkle’s ruling, issuing a statement calling it “erroneous,” and vowing to appeal.. “Through their elected representatives, the people of Florida acted to protect children in this state, and the Court was wrong to override their wishes,” the statement said. “As we’ve seen here in Florida, the United Kingdom, and across Europe, there is no quality evidence to support the chemical and physical mutilation of children. These procedures do permanent, life-altering damage to children, and history will look back on this fad in horror.”. But those who sued the state celebrated the decision.. Lucien Hamel, a transgender adult, issued a statement saying, “I’m so relieved the court saw there is no medical basis for this law — it was passed just to target transgender people like me and try to push us out of Florida.”. “This is my home. I’ve lived here my entire life,"" he said. “This is my son’s home. I can’t just uproot my family and move across the country. The state has no place interfering in people’s private medical decisions, and I’m relieved that I can once again get the healthcare that I need here in Florida.”. A mother of one of the children who sued said, “This ruling means I won’t have to watch my daughter needlessly suffer because I can’t get her the care she needs.”. “Seeing Susan’s fear about this ban has been one of the hardest experiences we’ve endured as parents,” said the woman. She was identified in court documents only as Jane Doe and her daughter as Susan Doe to protect their privacy. “All we’ve wanted is to take that fear away and help her continue to be the happy, confident child she is now.”. DeSantis had signed the law last year as he was gearing up for a presidential campaign that was highly based on culture wars.. “We never did this through all of human history until like, what, two weeks ago? Now this is something?” he told cheering supporters as he signed the bill. “They’re having third graders declare pronouns? We’re not doing the pronoun Olympics in Florida."". At trial, Florida’s attorneys had conceded that the state cannot stop someone from pursuing a transgender identity, but said it can regulate medical care.. For minors, the only treatments at issue are puberty blocking treatments and cross-sex hormones — giving testosterone to someone assigned female at birth, for example. Those who were undergoing treatment when the law was adopted in May 2023 were allowed to continue. Surgery, which is rare for minors, was still blocked.. For adults, treatment was still allowed but could only be done by a physician instead of an advanced practice registered nurse or other professional. It required the patient to sign a consent form in person while in the same room with the doctor, meaning the treatment couldn’t be done on a video call or otherwise online — something not normally required with other medical procedures. Violators could be charged criminally and medical providers could lose their licenses.. Hinkle wrote that Florida had long allowed treatment for gender dysphoria, the feeling that one’s gender identity does not match one’s sex as registered at birth.. “But then the political winds changed,” Hinkle wrote. He was appointed to the bench by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1996.. For 99% of people, Hinkle wrote, their biological sex and their gender identity are the same. But for a few, they differ. Hinkle said the state admitted that during the trial, even if some won’t believe it and think transgender people are making a choice like “whether to read Shakespeare or Grisham.”. “Many people with this view tend to disapprove of all things transgender and so oppose medical care that supports (it),” he said.. He said even though the state concedes it cannot constitutionally block people from identifying as transgender and presenting themselves as they wish, several legislators made it clear in their comments that this was their goal.. At least 25 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits.. The only other one to be struck down so far as unconstitutional is the ban in Arkansas, which the state has appealed to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.. Advocates are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to block Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors.. Judges’ orders are in place temporarily blocking enforcement of a ban in Montana and aspects of the ban in Georgia.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

DALLAS -- Space tourists experience some of the same body changes as astronauts who spend months in orbit, according to new studies published Tuesday.. Those shifts mostly returned to normal once the amateurs returned to Earth, researchers reported.. Research on four space tourists is included in a series of studies on the health effects of space travel, down to the molecular level. The findings paint a clearer picture of how people — who don't undergo years of astronaut training — adapt to weightlessness and space radiation, the researchers said.. “This will allow us to be better prepared when we’re sending humans into space for whatever reason,” said Allen Liu, a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Michigan who was not involved with the research.. NASA and others have long studied the toll of space travel on astronauts, including yearlong residents of the International Space Station, but there's been less attention on space tourists. The first tourist visit to the space station was in 2001, and opportunities for private space travel have expanded in recent years.. A three-day chartered flight in 2021 gave researchers the chance to examine how quickly the body reacts and adapts to spaceflight, said Susan Bailey, a radiation expert at Colorado State University who took part in the research.. While in space, the four passengers on the SpaceX flight, dubbed Inspiration4, collected samples of blood, saliva, skin and more. Researchers analyzed the samples and found wide-ranging shifts in cells and changes to the immune system. Most of these shifts stabilized in the months after the four returned home, and the researchers found that the short-term spaceflight didn’t pose significant health risks.. “This is the first time we've had a cell-by-cell examination of a crew when they go to space,” said researcher and co-author Chris Mason with Weill Cornell Medicine.. The papers, which were published Tuesday in Nature journals and are now part of a database, include the impact of spaceflight on the skin, kidneys and immune system. The results could help researchers find ways to counteract the negative effects of space travel, said Afshin Beheshti, a researcher with the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science who took part in the work.. ___.

abcnews.com,"With 100M birds dead, poultry industry could serve as example as dairy farmers confront bird flu",https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/100m-birds-dead-poultry-industry-serve-dairy-farmers-111007039,2024-06-11 10:30:25,"As the U.S. dairy industry confronts an outbreak of bird flu, the egg industry serves as an example of how to slow the spread of the disease but also how difficult it can be to completely eradicate the problem. DES MOINES, Iowa -- As the U.S. dairy industry confronts a bird flu outbreak, with cases reported at dozens of farms and the disease spreading to people, the egg industry could serve as an example of how to slow the disease but also shows how difficult it can be to eradicate the virus.. There have been earlier bird flu outbreaks in the U.S., but the current one started in February 2022 and has forced the slaughter of nearly 100 million chickens and turkeys. Hot spots still occur, but their frequency has dropped in part because of biosecurity efforts at farms and a coordinated approach between companies and agricultural officials, experts say.. Dairy farmers could try to implement similar safeguards, but the vast differences between the animals and the industries limit what lessons can be learned and applied.. It's commonly called bird flu because the disease is largely spread by wild birds that can survive infections. Many mammals have caught the illness too, including sea lions and skunks. . Animals can be infected by eating an infected bird or by being exposed to environments where the virus is present. That said, there are big differences in how cows and chickens have fared after getting infected.. Bird flu is typically fatal to chickens and turkeys within days of an infection, leading to immediate mass killings of birds. That's not true for cows. . Dairies in several states have reported having to kill infected animals because symptoms continued to linger and their milk production didn't recover, but that’s not the norm, said Russ Daly, an extension veterinarian at South Dakota State University.. He said it appears that bird flu isn't usually fatal to cows but that an infected animal can be more vulnerable to other ailments typically founds in dairies, such as bacterial pneumonia and udder infections.. Egg operators have become clean freaks.. To prevent disease from spreading, egg producers require workers to shower and change into clean clothes before they enter a barn and shower again when they leave. They also frequently wash trucks and spray tires with solutions to kill off virus remnants.. Many egg operations even use lasers and install special fencing to discourage wild birds from stopping by for a visit.. “Gone is the day of the scarecrow,” said Emily Metz, president of the American Egg Board.. Without these efforts, the current outbreak would be much worse, said Jada Thompson, a University of Arkansas agriculture business professor. Still, maintaining such vigilance is difficult, even if the cost of allowing disease into an operation is so high, she said.. Chickens raised for meat, known as broilers, also have been infected with bird flu but such cases are less common. In part, that’s because broiler chickens are killed when they’re only 6 to 8 weeks old, so they have less time to get infected. . Yes and no.. Dairies can certainly reduce the spread of disease by limiting access to barns, so people and equipment don't bring in the virus from elsewhere. Workers could also wear eye protection, aprons and gloves to try to protect themselves, but there's no way around it: Big animals are messy.. “The parlor is a warm, humid place with lots of liquid flying around, whether it's urine, feces, water because they're spraying off areas. Cows might kick off a milk machine so you get milk splatter,” said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Laboratory. . Dairies also don't have time or staff to disinfect milking equipment between animals, so equipment could become contaminated. Pasteurization kills bacteria and viruses in milk, making it safe for people to drink.. Poulsen said the dairy industry could follow a path laid by the poultry and pork industries and establish more formal, better funded research organizations so it could respond more quickly to problems like bird flu — or avoid them altogether.. The dairy industry also could tamp down disease spread by limiting the movement of lactating cows between states, Poulsen said.. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will soon begin testing a vaccine that could be given to calves, offering the animals protection and also reducing the chance of worker illnesses.. The egg industry also is hopeful researchers can develop vaccines for poultry that could be quick, inexpensive and effective. Workers can't give shots to the millions of hens that might need a vaccine, but industry officials hope a vaccine could be distributed in the water the birds drink, in the pellets they eat or even before birds hatch from their eggs.. Efforts to develop vaccines have become even more important now that the disease has spread to dairy cows and even a few people, Thompson said.. “Part or what is being developed right now is, what way can we vaccinate them that is cost-effective and disease resistant?” Thompson said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Cameroon or Canada? Poorly paid doctors and nurses are choosing to leave. That's common in Africa,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/cameroon-canada-poorly-paid-doctors-nurses-choosing-leave-111006210,2024-06-11 21:02:30,"Cameroon has one of the world's lowest number of health workers per capita. DAKAR, Senegal -- After training as a nurse, Nevielle Leinyuy spent almost a decade in Cameroon working as a front desk receptionist because he was unable to find a decent paying job in the medical field. Last year, he gave up looking. He applied for a nursing program in Canada, where he now lives with his wife and children.. “They are stealing us from Cameroon,” the 39-year-old Leinyuy said. “We want to work in Cameroon but there is no pay, so we have to look for other options.”. Cameroon has one of the world's lowest ratios of health workers per capita. About a third of trained doctors who graduated from medical school last year left the country, the minister of higher education, Jacques Fame Ndongo, has said.. Many doctors and nurses are leaving the West African nation for more lucrative jobs in Europe and North America. Canada, like Cameroon, has official languages of English and French.. Leinyuy said he would have earned 60,000 CFA francs, or less than $100 a month, working as a nurse in Cameroon.. “Just imagine what a family of a father with three kids and a wife would do with that,” he said. “The rent of my house alone was 40,000 francs ($66).”. Cameroon is not the only sub-Saharan African country where low salaries are driving health workers to leave.. While the number of health workers increased after the COVID pandemic in several countries, almost 75% of African nations still experience medical staff shortages and high rates of healthcare professionals leaving to work abroad, according to a 2023 report from the World Health Organization.. The lack of health workers makes it increasingly difficult to tackle infant mortality and infectious diseases and provide essential services like vaccinations, the WHO regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, has said.. Cameroon has fewer than seven nurses per 10,000 inhabitants, according to the latest WHO data. Neighboring Nigeria has more than double that ratio, and Canada has more than 14-fold.. Marie-Pier Burelle, a spokesperson for Health Canada, told The Associated Press that Canada is facing its own health workforce shortages. Over 30,000 nursing positions in the country are vacant, according to Statistics Canada.. Burelle said Canada follows the WHO’s code of practice to ensure that its recruitment of workers internationally is ethical. Ethical recruitment includes strengthening the health systems of developing countries dealing with medical personnel shortages, according to the WHO’s code of practice.. Late last year, the Canadian government donated around $2.2 million to Cameroon's health ministry and delivered medical and monitoring equipment as part of Canada's Global Initiative for Vaccine Equity.. But such investment falls far short of needs.. Cameroon’s government employs around 100 doctors each year, for a population of around 28 million people, said Dr. Peter Louis Ndifor, the vice president of the Cameroon Medical Council, a doctors association. He said the numbers are even lower in the private sector.. By comparison, the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, with a population of under a million people, recruited around 155 doctors last year, according to provincial health authorities.. As the director of a private medical clinic, Ndifor said he experienced the problem of health workers leaving Cameroon firsthand.. “Personally, I will not hold back any young person who thinks that their future is traveling abroad,” Ndifor said. “But when a young doctor that you’ve supervised for three to five years and given responsibility to leaves, it becomes a major setback.”. The shortage of health workers is just part of Cameroon's current health crisis.. More than 210 health facilities are no longer functional because of destruction or abandonment by health personnel during a separatist conflict in the country's west, according to the United Nations. The conflict has killed thousands of people over the past several years.. Cameroon’s health ministry did not respond to questions about the high number of health workers leaving the country.. Tumenta Kennedy, a Cameroon-based migration consultant, said Canada has become an attractive destination because Canadian agencies specifically target local doctors and nurses. Family ties overseas also play a role.. Canadian government immigration programs like the Federal Skilled Worker Program or Express Entry are increasingly active. Cameroonians are among the top nationalities applying for Express Entry, according to the program's latest report.. Overall in 2022, more than 1,800 new permanent residents came to Canada to work as registered nurses from other nations.. Inès Kingue, 30, a medical lab technician from Douala, is hoping to join them. Despite holding two masters degrees in virology and microbiology, she has been working as an intern without a contract for the past four years, earning less than $200 a month. She heard about training opportunities in Canada from a colleague.. “When Canada opened its doors, I put all my focus into trying to go there,” Kingue said. ___.

WASHINGTON -- When Robert De Niro showed up outside a Manhattan courthouse to decry Donald Trump as his New York hush money trial was winding down, it sparked a life-imitates-art screaming match with a nearby group of the former president's supporters.. “You are gangsters!” De Niro, who starred in “Goodfellas” and won an Oscar for “The Godfather Part II,"" shouted at the Trump backers, who responded with obscenities.. There are plenty more Hollywood storylines still to come in the 2024 campaign: Celebrities are increasingly lending their star power to President Joe Biden, hoping to energize their fans to vote for him in November and to entice donors to pony up for his reelection effort.. On Saturday, A-listers George Clooney and Julia Roberts will team up with former President Barack Obama at a Biden fundraiser in Los Angeles, where the three will be interviewed by late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. Roberts and Kimmel have already begun soliciting donations via text for Biden, who is skipping a weekend peace conference on Ukraine being held in Switzerland to attend the event. . Director Steven Spielberg is involved in storytelling efforts for the Democratic National Convention in August. Lenny Kravitz, Barbra Streisand and James Taylor have all performed for Biden donors.. Others who've sent fundraising emails, organized events or otherwise lent their support include Connie Britton of “The White Lotus” fame, singer-songwriter Carole King, “Bridgerton” creator Shonda Rhimes, singer Christina Aguilera, “The Equalizer” actress Queen Latifah and “Star Wars” actor Mark Hamill, who turned up in the White House briefing room last month to personally praise the president.. And, in another instance blurring lines between real life and make-believe, during a fundraiser at the home of veteran actor Michael Douglas, Biden, the actual president, congratulated the star of the 1996 hit “The American President” on his fictional administration's success. . For all the celebrity supporters, though, there's little expectation they can determine votes. Rather, they are seen as having the ability to inject excitement that helps energize supporters.. Lexi Underwood, whose credits include the streaming series “Little Fires Everywhere,” calls acting a “contact sport” that allows her to interact with the public and makes her determined to use her influence responsibly. She has participated in a recent virtual ”Students for Biden” event and traveled to Nevada to appear at campaign events focused on women's health issues.. “I’m very fortunate to have certain eyes on me,"" said Underwood, 20. ""I feel really responsible to make sure that what I put out there, either people are being informed on things that they weren’t previously informed on, or that I’m motivating them to get out there and vote.”. Biden's campaign says its chief focus is finding authentic and trusted messengers who can promote the president's policy achievements and raise the alarm about GOP “extremism,"" and that means deploying everyday supporters as well as famous ones. It has produced ads featuring a Pennsylvania union worker, a Black entrepreneur in Detroit and women adversely affected by strict abortion limits in Texas.. Fai Nelson, a human resources worker who attended a recent Vice President Kamala Harris event in Prince George's County, Maryland, said celebrity voices can make a difference “if they can touch the audience.” . “It’s whether the message is relevant,"" said Nelson, 42.. During the pandemic-era campaign of 2020, Biden's campaign featured celebrities in scores of virtual events that showed the importance of staying flexible so that stars can present themselves in the most authentic ways. . Adrienne Elrod, who served as Biden’s 2020 director of surrogate strategy and operations, said famous Biden supporters often “will come forward with their own ideas” on how to help the campaign and what issues they'd like to focus on. . “We’ll oftentimes have ideas for them as well,"" she said. “That’s why there’s always a very productive working relationship when we’re engaging these folks.”. De Niro has taken on an increasingly prominent role in Biden's campaign. Before his confrontation with the Trump supporters, the actor held a press conference calling the former president a “clown."" He's also attended Biden fundraisers and narrated a campaign ad accusing Trump of having “snapped” after he lost the 2020 election. . Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the former president's campaign, said, “The only people in America who support Joe Biden’s failing campaign are elitist Hollywood celebrities,"" adding that Trump “speaks for the forgotten men and women of this country.”. Trump has his own list of celebrity endorsers, which includes musicians Kid Rock and Ted Nugent, UFC CEO Dana White, media personality Caitlyn Jenner and actors Dennis Quaid and Jon Voight, as well as comedian Roseanne Barr.. Elrod said other stars are anxious to follow De Niro's lead for Biden but are waiting ""until the moment can truly be maximized"" before they get involved. She pointed to 2020, when Bruce Springsteen narrated a Biden ad featuring his song “My Hometown” just before the election.. ""I think you’ll see more moments like this, when we’re using those voices strategically and effectively at the time that makes the most sense for us on the campaign,” said Elrod, who is a Biden campaign spokesperson this cycle.. David Schmid, an English professor at the University of Buffalo who studies popular culture, said celebrities can influence fans' aspirations and what they consume. But their influence “over peoples’ voting habits has been really exaggerated,"" he said. . That's the case for Alex Dillion, a rising sophomore at American University in Washington who also attended the Harris event in Maryland. Asked which famous person might influence him politically, Dillion offered, “Maybe Obama.”. Schmid said one celebrity with outsized political influence might be Taylor Swift, who sent shockwaves even through the NFL last season. She endorsed Biden in 2020 and is being openly courted by the campaign this time on social media, and even in a press release that saluted her latest album.. Her touch isn't a guarantee of victory, though. In 2018, Swift endorsed two Democratic candidates in Tennessee who lost. And Schmid said that even someone as famous as Swift “knows things are polarizing and they don't want to take major risks” on candidates and contentious issues.. For all the Biden team's work with celebrities, the president still tries to cultivate the image of someone in tune with ordinary people.. During a campaign swing through Saginaw, Michigan, the president visited a public golf course and met with community activist Coleman Hurley III and his son.. “The celebrities that have everything they want and they need, they may possibly be out of touch,"" the older Hurley said later in a phone interview.. As for ordinary Americans, Hurley added, Biden needs to be able to ""relate and see where they live ... and then have a conversation about some of the different struggles or issues that we, or other Americans, face.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,"Ozy Media went from buzzy to belly-up. Its founder, Carlos Watson, is now on trial",https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/ozy-media-buzzy-belly-founder-carlos-watson-now-111080573,2024-06-13 00:22:17,"For nearly a decade, Ozy Media projected an image of new-media success. NEW YORK -- For nearly a decade, Ozy Media projected an image of new-media success.. The company boasted big-name interviews, an Emmy-winning TV show, a buzzy music and ideas festival and impressive numbers to show prospective investors — until it imploded in 2021 amid doubts about its audience size, viability and basic integrity.. Those doubts are now at the center of a federal criminal trial. Founder Carlos Watson and Ozy are fighting charges of conspiracy to commit fraud.. Even after numerous other public and court reckonings for Silicon Valley companies that went from ballyhooed to belly-up, it's hard to forget the moment in Ozy's downfall when co-founder Samir Rao impersonated a YouTube executive to talk up the company to prospective investors.. Watson's and Ozy's lawyers blame any misrepresentations solely on Rao, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and to identity theft. The defense also has claimed that prosecutors are casting commonplace entrepreneurial puffery as a crime and singling out Watson, a Black founder in a tech world where African American executives have been disproportionately few.. “I am not now and never have been a ‘con man,’” he declared when indicted last year.. Prosecutors and Rao, their star witness, say Ozy shredded the line between hopeful hype and bald-faced deceit.. “We told so many lies to so many different people,” Rao testified after recounting how a teetering company concocted rosy financials in a desperate bid to lure investors and stay in business.. The hope was to enable “a diverse audience, to consume, hopefully, a different, more meaningful kind of content,” he said. But “survival within the bonds of decency, fairness, truth, it morphed into survival at all costs and by any means necessary."". Ozy was founded in 2012 on a Millennial-friendly premise of providing a fresh, sophisticated-but-not-stuffy take on politics, culture and more — billed as “the new and the next” — while amplifying minority and marginalized voices.. A Harvard and Stanford-educated son of two South Florida teachers, Watson had worked on Wall Street, started and sold a test-prep company and anchored on MSNBC. He conceived of Ozy and then recruited Rao, a former finance-world colleague, after a chance meeting at a Chipotle restaurant in Silicon Valley, according to Rao.. Ozy debuted with a website, newsletters and a bang: Former President Bill Clinton was one of its first interviewees. The company expanded into podcasts, events and TV shows, winning a 2020 Emmy for the Watson-hosted “Black Women OWN the Conversation,” on the Oprah Winfrey Network. The annual Ozy Fest in New York's Central Park drew big names ranging from John Legend to a pre-presidency Joe Biden.. The company attracted a roster of major advertisers, clients and grants, according to testimony. But behind the scenes, prosecutors say, Ozy started bleeding money in 2018 and began trying to save itself with lies.. The company told a prospective investor it “finished 2017 with approximately 12 million in revenue” but gave its accountants a number under $7 million. The gaps widened with the years, yawning to as much as $53 million-vs.-$11 million for 2020, according to testimony and documents shown at trial.. Meanwhile, Ozy frequently delayed paying vendors and rent, borrowed against future receipts to get pricey cash advances and struggled to make payroll, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre testified.. The defense portrayed the cash scrambles as the growing pains of a successful startup.. ""Ozy Media did not defraud its investors or anyone else,” said the company's lawyer, Shannon Frison.. Watson lawyer and Harvard Law School Professor Ronald Sullivan Jr. said his client “believed every number that he gave every investor.” Sullivan suggested revenue figures could vary depending on whether they account for such “in-kind” income as trading ads with another outlet.. Poutre testified that auditors rarely agree to count such revenue and she did not feel Watson was always honest.. “I don’t know where his numbers came from. I know where my numbers came from,"" she said.. The alleged schemes went beyond questionable numbers.. While trying to get Ozy a bank loan in 2020, Rao faked a contract saying that Winfrey’s OWN network had renewed “Black Women OWN The Conversation” for a second season. When the bank wanted information directly from the network, Rao set up a phony email account for a real OWN executive and used it to offer the bank ""background on the transaction.”. Rao told jurors that Watson verbally approved the charade. Jurors saw a text message from Watson exhorting Rao to “be bold, get it done,” but the ”it"" wasn't specified. Ultimately, witnesses said, neither the loan nor the show renewal happened.. Rao's infamous phone call came the next year as Ozy sought an investment from Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs. He'd falsely claimed YouTube was paying for Watson's eponymous talk show. When Goldman bankers wanted confirmation, he downloaded a voice-modifying app and pretended to be a YouTube executive on a call with them.. But the bankers were wary, the real YouTube exec soon found out and Watson told Goldman Sachs and Ozy's board that his co-founder had suffered a mental breakdown.. The investment didn’t materialize, but Goldman Sachs continued advertising with Ozy after the episode, Rao said.. Rao told jurors he was taking antidepressants but was not having a psychiatric crisis when he made the call. Watson was present and coaching him via text message, Rao said.. “I am a big fan of Carlos, Samir and the show,” reads one text, which Rao explained as Watson feeding him a line for his phony persona to say. Then Watson urged, “use the right pronouns. You are NOT OZY,” among other messages.. Watson’s lawyer said the Ozy founder stumbled upon Rao’s deceit midstream, was appalled and signaled him to hang up.. The defense has emphasized that Rao drafted a 2021 letter — ultimately unsent — saying the phone ruse was his alone. Rao told jurors he wrote it to protect the company.. Defense lawyers have cast him as an incompetent executive, confessed fabricator and admitted criminal who's falsely implicating Watson in hopes of avoiding prison for his own crimes.. “So, Mr. Rao, you're a liar, right?” Sullivan asked during cross-examination last Friday.. “Regrettably,"" Rao replied, “I've told many lies in my time at Ozy.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Tom Brady brought the New England Patriots endless memories and six Super Bowl trophies during his two-decade run with the team. . The Patriots made sure his induction into the franchise's Hall of Fame was a celebration unlike it had ever thrown before. . Dozens of Brady's former teammates and coaches, spanning multiple eras of Patriots history joined thousands of fans and celebrities including Jay-Z and Bon Jovi on Wednesday night to salute Brady as the 35th person to be enshrined into the team's hall. . “Patriots nation, it’s good to be home,” Brady said. . Before Brady spoke, team owner Robert Kraft brought Brady to tears when he announced that his No. 12 would never be worn by another Patriots player.. “The No. 12 is now officially retired,” Kraft said.. Kraft also announced that a 12-foot bronze statue of Brady was being commissioned and it would be placed outside the Patriots Hall of Fame later this year.. In a night that felt like a Patriots family reunion, the biggest moment was reserved before Brady's speech when he was reunited with former Patriots coach Bill Belichick. It included an extended ovation for Belichick, who parted ways with the team after the 2023 season. . “It was a tremendous honor for me to draft Tom and coach Tom for 20 years,” Belichick told the crowd. “Everything he brought to the team, it was really an honor for me to be involved with that."". Brady weighed in on the never-ending debate about whether he or Belichick was most responsible Patriots success during their time together. . “It wasn’t me. It wasn’t you. It was us,” Brady said. “Let me make it clear. There is no other coach I’d rather play for than Bill Belichick."". The evening began with a red carpet featuring a who's who of Brady's 20 seasons with the Patriots, including Ty Law, Willie McGinest, Randy Moss, Vince Wilfork, Drew Bledsoe and Rob Gronkowski, among others. It also included Brady's parents, Tom Sr. and Galynn Brady.. The official ceremony inside Gillette Stadium was kicked off by a smoke-filled performance by rapper Jay-Z of his 2003 “Public Service Announcement,” which Brady used as entrance music when he'd jogged onto the field to warmup before games. . On this night, Brady emerged from near the stage at the end of Jay-Z's performance, walking through the section reserved for the night's special guests before taking a seat on stage himself.. There he watched video tributes from his competitors over the years, including Ray Lewis and Ed Reed, Charles Woodson and Jason Taylor. There were also video appearances by former New York Giants Michael Strahan and Eli Manning, who were booed by fans who haven't forgotten how the Giants spoiled the Patriots' bid for a perfect season with their upset in the 2007 Super Bowl. They defeated Brady and company again in the 2011 Super Bowl. . Other video cameos included some of Boston’s most celebrated celebrities, such as Red Sox great David Ortiz and Matt Damon.. The No. 199 pick in the 2000 draft, Brady inherited the starting job in his second season in New England when Bledsoe, the former No. 1 overall pick, was injured and led the Patriots to a Super Bowl championship that year. He won five more titles over the next two decades.. Back with Brady again, Bledsoe joked that Brady didn't follow the No. 1 rule as his backup.. “You were the worst backup quarterback in the history of the NFL,"" Bledsoe said. ""You never learned that when I got healthy, that you were supposed to go sit back down.”. There were emotional moments. Like when some of Brady's top playmakers — Moss, Gronkowski, Julian Edelman and Wes Welker joined Brady on stage. . Moss was moved to tears as the crowd showered him a two-minute ovation. Moss recalled how when he arrived in New England in 2007 he knew he had to be close to Brady. . “Put my locker beside Tom Brady’s and the rest will take care of itself,"" Moss said. . There were also surprise in-person guests, like Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning participating in a sit down discussion with Brady and the night's host Mike Tirico to discuss the quarterbacks' on-field clashes over the years. . Manning revealed how he never counted the Patriots out when his teams faced Brady, especially when Brady had the ball with a chance to win late in games. . “I was praying on the sidelines,"" Manning said. ""I never pray on the sidelines.”. Brady paid Manning compliments as well, calling him one of his best friends. He also noted how he'd followed Manning's career as a young quarterback, dating back to high school.. “There's nobody out there like Peyton Manning right now,” Brady said.. Manning even offered some of his textbook quips, drawing cheers from what was often a hostile New England crowd when he lamented, “They like me here because I always lost here.”.  In front of a crowd spilling with his No. 12 jersey, Brady said his family and the Patriots will be forever intertwined.. “I feel like we’re still the family that’s trying to love each other,” Brady said. “We’re adopted New Englanders.”. At one point Brady ran down the list of towns he’d lived in around New England during his time with the Patriots, from Franklin to Quincy to Chestnut Hill to Brookline.. Brady concluded his speech welling with tears. . “I am Tom Brady. And I am a Patriot,"" he said.. ___. AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,DeSantis appointees bury the hatchet with Disney by approving new development deal,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/desantis-appointees-bury-hatchet-disney-approving-new-development-111077851,2024-06-12 21:34:30,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees have given final approval to an agreement that buries the hatchet between Disney and the governing district for Walt Disney World. ORLANDO, Fla. -- Gov. Ron DeSantis' appointees on Wednesday gave final approval to an agreement that buries the hatchet between Disney and the governing district for Walt Disney World, which the Florida governor took over after the company two years ago publicly opposed a state law critics dubbed “Don't Say Gay.”. The five DeSantis-appointed board members to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District unanimously voted to approve a 15-year development deal in which the district committed to making infrastructure improvements in exchange for Disney investing up to $17 billion into Disney World over the next two decades.. The agreement followed a detente in March in which both sides agreed to stop litigating each other in state court and work towards negotiating a new development agreement and a new comprehensive plan no later than next year. The district provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, among other things, and was controlled by Disney supporters before the takeover by the DeSantis appointees.. District board member Brian Aungst said at Wednesday night's board meeting that the agreement provides a lasting and stable framework for Disney and the board to work together.. “This is the day we all have been looking forward to,” Aungst said. “I was always extremely optimistic and knew we would get here because it was the right outcome.”. Under the deal, Disney will be required to donate up to 100 acres (40 hectares) of Disney World’s 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) for the construction of infrastructure projects controlled by the district. The company also will need to award at least half of its construction projects to companies based in Florida and spend at least $10 million on affordable housing for central Florida.. Disney would then be approved to build a fifth major theme park at Disney World and two more minor parks, such as water parks, if it desired. The company could raise the number of hotel rooms on its property from almost 40,000 rooms to more than 53,000 rooms and increase the amount of retail and restaurant space by more than 20%. Disney will retain control of building heights due to its need to maintain an immersive environment.. Leaders of Orlando's tourism industry praised the agreement, telling the district's board members that it will bring boundless jobs, tourists and attention to central Florida.. “It very clearly demonstrates to the world that the district and Disney are eager to resume working together for the great state of Florida,” said Robert Earl, founder and CEO of Planet Hollywood International, Inc.. Still up in the air was an appeal of a federal lawsuit Disney had filed against DeSantis and his appointees. After the settlement was reached in March, Disney asked the appellate court to put that case on hold while the development agreement was negotiated. The company has until next week to file a brief with the court if it wants to move ahead with the case.. Disney didn't respond to an email Wednesday afternoon seeking comment on how the company planned to proceed. The DeSantis appointees to the district had planned to hold a closed-door discussion about the lawsuit after their board meeting Wednesday but cancelled that meeting.. Matthew Oberly, a spokesperson for the district, said Wednesday night that the district didn't have any comment on the future of the federal litigation. . The March settlement ended almost two years of litigation sparked by DeSantis’ takeover of the district following the company’s opposition to the 2022 law that bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by the Republican governor, who used Disney as a punching bag in speeches during his run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination until he suspended his campaign earlier this year.. As punishment for Disney’s opposition to the controversial law, DeSantis took over the governing district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors. Disney sued DeSantis and his appointees, claiming the company’s free speech rights were violated for speaking out against the legislation. A federal judge dismissed that lawsuit in January, but Disney appealed.. Before control of the district changed hands early last year, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with the company shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees claimed the “eleventh-hour deals” neutered their powers, and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided.. Disney filed counterclaims that included asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable. Those state court lawsuits were dismissed as part of the March settlement.. ___.

LOS ANGELES -- After organizers for Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July hot dog-eating contest said Joey Chestnut wouldn’t compete this year because of a deal with a rival brand, Netflix swiftly announced a new hot dog-eating competition that will feature Chestnut and his “fiercest rival.”. Chestnut, a 16-time hot dog-eating champion, will face off with his frequent Nathan’s competitor, Takeru Kobayashi, in a live Netflix special on Sept. 2, the streamer announced Wednesday. . The contest, titled “Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef,” will feature the two chowing down on all-beef hot dogs, likely in a nod to reports that Chestnut’s rival brand deal is with Impossible Foods, which makes plant-based hot dogs.. Major League Eating, the organization that oversees the Nathan’s contest, announced Tuesday that Chestnut’s deal was an “exclusivity” issue, saying that it was his decision to step back from the competition he has participated in since 2005. “We love him. The fans love him,” said George Shea, a Major League Eating event organizer, adding: “He made the choice.”. Chestnut disputed that he made the choice, saying on the social platform X that Nathan’s and Major League Eating made the decision, adding that it would “deprive fans of the holiday’s usual joy and entertainment.”. He also wrote that fans could “rest assured” that they would see him east again soon, adding: “STAY HUNGRY!”. Impossible Foods has not confirmed a formal relationship with Chestnut, but he said in a statement on Tuesday they support his choice to compete in any competition, adding “Meat eaters shouldn’t have to be exclusive to just one wiener.”. Following Netflix’s announcement, Shea said the streamer was “trying to recreate the Nathan’s contest to some extent and you just can’t do that.”. “Imitation is the best form of flattery,” he added. . New York City Mayor Eric Adams joined the conversation via X on Wednesday, urging Nathan's and Major League Eating to “stop being such weenies.” “It would be ‘impossible’ to have this year's Nathan's Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest without Joey Chestnut,” he wrote. “Let's find a way to squash this beef and bring back the champ for another 4th of July at Coney Island!”. In a Netflix news release announcing the competition, Chestnut said he was eager bring the competition to the streaming service.. “Through all of my years in competitive eating, Kobayashi stands out as my fiercest rival,” Chestnut said via the release. “Competing against him pushed me to be so much better. I know that fans have waited a long time for another chapter of our rivalry and I can’t wait for our massive showdown live on Netflix! It’s time to give the people what they want!”. Kobayashi, who has been rumored to be retired, said in the Netflix release that he is looking forward to facing off with Chestnut once more. The two have not competed since 2009.. “Retiring for me will only happen after I take him down one last time,” Kobayashi said. “This rivalry has been brewing for a long time. Competing against Joey live on Netflix means fans all over the world can watch me knock him out.”. The hot dog-eating competition is the latest of the streamer's recent efforts to expand into live TV, and it highlights the company's emphasis on sporting events, which will include Christmas Day NFL games starting this year and WWE's “Raw” in 2025. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

LONDON -- The stars of “Bridgerton,” Netflix’s Regency-era drama rife with romance and heartbreak, offered some dating and relationship advice for fans looking for love.. Nicola Coughlan and Luke Newton, who play Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton, dominate the third season’s storyline with their friends-to-lovers story arc. At Wednesday's London premiere for the second part of season 3, which hits Netflix on Thursday, the pair joked about how fans often suspect that they are dating in real life because of their on-screen chemistry.. “We can’t do anything,” Coughlan quipped after noting that it’s often a “reflex” for her to interact with Newton in a friendly manner because they’ve known each other and worked together for many years. Newton said that the speculation points to fans’ investment in their characters’ relationship.. “It’s really sweet, it’s so lovely that there’s that much thought into it and how much they ship Colin and Pen,” he said. “It’s a beautiful thing.”. With their character’s dreamy (and steamy) relationship attracting so much attention, Coughlan offered some advice to viewers looking for their own storybook romance.. “Don’t compromise yourself,” she said. “Wait for the right person because you’re worth it.”. Newton said he “agreed with all of the above.” Here’s the advice the rest of the cast shared for the romantics watching “Bridgerton”:. Simone Ashley, who plays Kate Bridgerton and was at the heart of the second season’s storyline, said watching the show makes viewers “want to fall in love.”. “It’s very hopeful, and it makes you believe. It really captures your imagination and your heart again,” Ashley said. “The same feeling that the show brings — pass that on to someone else. Make someone else feel as amazing as the show makes you feel.”. Golda Rosheuvel, who plays Queen Charlotte, said communication is “everything” in a relationship and noted that in this season, communication is vital to keeping Colin and Penelope’s relationship alive. “Love wins every time,” she added.. The show’s creator, Shonda Rhimes, said fans should “raise (their) standards.” She noted that the men on ""Bridgerton"" are “supportive and loving and all know how to dress and dance,” adding that she wants “to feel like those guys are out there.”. Ruth Gemmell offered some simple, maternal advice, much like her character, Lady Violet Bridgerton, would: “Be true to yourself.”. Claudia Jessie, who plays Eloise Bridgerton, shared some wisdom that diverged from the idealist advice some of her co-stars gave, saying, “Romanticism has probably messed us up a bit.”. “The majority of your life is going to be figuring out domestic things and that’s really not sexy and it’s boring, but it’s really a massive part of life,” she said. “So romance, whilst it’s beautiful, don’t rely on it for the rest of your life.”. Newcomer Hannah Dodd, who took over the role of Francesca Bridgerton this season, laughed when asked about dating advice. . “Don’t ask me that,” she said, seeming to allude she might be seeking dating advice, as well.. While his character Lord Marcus Anderson may seem like a bit of a player, Daniel Francis shared some sage advice on how to find a good match.. “There’s three things: Know what you want, know why you want it … and this is a tricky one for a lot of people, but I truly believe in this — you got to make sure you’re fishing in the right pond,” he said.. ___.

Kelly's trial on child sex abuse charges, has died. U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber, who presided over singer R. Kelly’s trial on child sex abuse charges, has died. He was 87. . Leinenweber died Tuesday evening, the eastern division of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois said in a statement. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Leinenweber had been diagnosed with lung cancer earlier this year and died at the Florida home he shared with his wife.. “Judge Harry D. Leinenweber was a friend, mentor and model jurist,” Northern District of Illinois Chief Judge Rebecca R. Pallmeyer said in the statement. “My colleagues and I are deeply saddened by Judge Leinenweber's passing. We hope for comfort and peace for his family. We thank his family for sharing him with us for over 39 years.”. President Ronald Reagan nominated Leinenweber, a former state lawmaker, to the bench in 1985. He took senior status, a form of semi-retirement, in 2002 but continued to work. . He presided over Kelly’s trial in 2022. Prosecutors accused the Grammy Award-winning singer of producing sexually explicit videos of children and enticing girls for sex. The trial went on for a month before jurors ultimately convicted Kelly of six of 13 counts against him.. The verdict came months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Leinenweber sentenced the singer to 20 years in prison in the Illinois case.. Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonojean wrote in an email that she loved trying cases in front of Leinenweber.. “He allowed attorneys to do their jobs and never put his thumb on the scales of justice,” she wrote. “He was an honorable judge and an honorable man. The judiciary needs more judges like him. He will be missed by attorneys from all sides of the aisle.”. Leinenweber also oversaw a trial last year that ended with four people convicted in a bribery conspiracy that provided an inside look at pay-to-play politics in Illinois. Prosecutors accused two former executives with utility ComEd, a former utility consultant and a longtime government insider of arranging contracts, jobs and money of then-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan's associates to ensure bills boosting ComEd profits became law. Madigan has been indicted in the case. His trial is set to begin next year. . Robert Gaines served as a juror in the ComEd trial. He told the Sun-Times that Leinenweber had “complete control of the courtroom.”. “He knew how to put his foot down, and then he knew how to let it up,” Gaines said. “He was so cool and level-headed. He was the coolest judge I've ever seen, on TV or off TV.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

Sony Pictures Entertainment is getting into the exhibition business. The studio behind recent films like “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” and “The Garfield Movie” has acquired the distinctive theater chain Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, the companies said Wednesday. Included in the deal is the genre film festival Fantastic Fest.. Sony said it will continue to welcome content from all studios and distributors at the dine-in theaters. . Alamo Drafthouse was founded in 1997 as a single screen, family-owned repertory theater in Austin, Texas, and has grown to 35 locations in North America. It distinguished itself in the exhibition landscape with drinks, dine-in food service and a cool vibe that became a favorite of cinephiles. . “We are beyond thrilled to join forces with Sony Pictures Entertainment to expand our company vision to be the best damn cinema that has ever, or will ever, exist now in ways we could only ever dream of,” Alamo Drafthouse founder Tim League said in a statement. “They have a deep respect and understanding of cinema’s ability to both drive growth and create lasting cultural impact which aligns perfectly with everything Alamo Drafthouse stands for.”. For Sony, the Drafthouse acquisition is also tied into its experiences initiatives, including its Wheel of Fortune Live! Traveling tour and the Wonderverse space in Chicago. Ravi Ahuja, the president and chief operating officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment, also noted that the studio’s Crunchyroll films are particularly aligned with the interests of Drafthouse fans.. Alamo Drafthouse has seen its ups and downs over the years. In March 2021, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, closed some locations and canceled plans to open new ones. Alamo emerged from bankruptcy at the end of May 2021, under the ownership of League, Altamont Capital Partners and Fortress Investment Group. Michael Kusterman, a former executive at Caveman Foods, was named Alamo CEO. He will remain, heading the newly established Sony Pictures Experiences division and reporting to Ahuja, the statement said.. Last year following the frenzy of Barbenheimer, employees at the Alamo Drafthouse in Manhattan and Brooklyn voted to unionize. Similar efforts were attempted at locations in San Francisco and Austin and were met with resistance from the leadership.. For many years, Hollywood studios could not run movie theaters and control what was played on those screens following a landmark antitrust Supreme Court case in 1948 that outlawed practices like “block booking,” in which studios required theaters to book a bundle of their films. Each of the major studios entered into a consent decree with the Department of Justice, known as the Paramount Consent Decrees, which required the major studios that owned theaters at the time to either divest distribution operations or their theaters.. Conflicts between Hollywood studio business practices and the federal government go back to the early 1920s, over concerns about vertical integration and the monopolization of film production and distribution. In the 1930s and 1940s, most first-run movie theaters had only one screen. . Distribution and exhibition have undergone vast changes since the days of the Paramount Consent Decrees, including the proliferation of multiplex theaters that show films from different exhibitors throughout the day and the advent of television, home video and streaming. The separation mandate officially went away in 2020 when the Paramount Consent Decrees were terminated. . Now Netflix, for instance, owns several theaters in New York and Los Angeles, and the Walt Disney Co., which was not part of the original “big eight” in the 1940s, owns and operates the El Capitan in Los Angeles. Movie theater chains have also stepped outside their lane recently, with artists like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé partnering directly with AMC Theaters to distribute their concert films.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — The Tony Awards are Sunday with a familiar host and a new venue, Lincoln Center's David H. Koch Theater in Manhattan. Here's a guide on what to look for and what to expect. . Academy Award winner and Tony nominee Ariana DeBose, who hosted the last two ceremonies, returns this year and will produce and choreograph the opening number. Other hosts who have done it multiple times include Angela Lansbury, Hugh Jackman, Neil Patrick Harris and James Corden. DeBose was praised for keeping last year's show afloat without a script during the Hollywood writers strike.. The three-hour main telecast will air on CBS and stream on Paramount+ starting at 8 p.m. Eastern, with a free pre-show — where some technical awards will be handed out — on Pluto TV at 6:30 p.m. That pre-show — officially called “The Tony Awards: Act One” — will be hosted by Julianne Hough and Utkarsh Ambudkar. . Presenters include Angelina Jolie, Nick Jonas, Idina Menzel, Ashley Park, Jim Parsons, Wendell Pierce, Ben Platt, Cynthia Erivo, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Josh Gad, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Sean Hayes, Taraji P. Henson, Julianne Hough, Jennifer Hudson, Pete Townshend, Tamara Tunie, Adrienne Warren, Patrick Wilson, Anthony Ramos, Andrew Rannells and Jeffrey Wright.. The casts of new musicals and revivals will be performing numbers and medleys hoping to transform TV viewers into theatergoers. Eddie Redmayne will be the super-creepy emcee of “Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club”; Jonathan Groff, Lindsay Mendez and Daniel Radcliffe will perform for “Merrily We Roll Along” and look for some circus thrills when the musical “Water for Elephants” gets its spotlight. Other shows performing include “Hell’s Kitchen,” “Illinoise,” “Suffs,” “The Outsiders” and “The Who’s Tommy.” In a last-minute switch, CBS made room for ""Stereophonic,” the raved-about new play with music by former Arcade Fire's Will Butler.. Two shows with a leading 13 nominations each explore the origins of music — a piano prodigy's coming-of-age in “Hell’s Kitchen” and the back-and-forth struggles to create an album in the play “Stereophonic.” They are competing in different categories, best new musical and best new play.. Looking to beat “Hell's Kitchen” are the musical “The Outsiders,” an adaptation of the beloved S. E. Hinton novel and the Francis Ford Coppola film; “Illinoise,” the dance-heavy, dialogue-less stage adaptation of Sufjan Stevens’ 2005 album “Illinois”; “Suffs,” based on the American suffragists of the early 20th century and “Water for Elephants,” which combines Sara Gruen’s 2006 bestseller with circus elements.. Hoping to knock down “Stereophonic” are “Mother Play,” Paula Vogel’s look at a mother and her kids spanning 1964 to the 21st century; “Mary Jane,” Amy Herzog’s humanistic portrait of a divorced mother of a young boy with severe health issues; “Prayer for the French Republic,” Joshua Harmon’s sprawling family comedy-drama that deals with Zionism, religious fervency and antisemitism; and “Jaja’s African Hair Braiding,” Jocelyn Bioh’s comedy about the lives of West African women working at a salon.. OK, but not great. This past season grossed a cumulative $1.54 billion, down 2.4% from the previous season. There were 12,287,708 admissions to Broadway, on par with the data from the prior season. But expenses keep going up so flat numbers don’t bode well. . Broadway hasn't fully recovered since the pandemic. The total gross is down from the record-setting $1.8 billion during the 2018-2019 season, the last full season before COVID-19 hit, and attendance is down 17%, too. But the average ticket price for the season just ended was $125.27, about 2% lower that last season’s $128.43 — good news for consumers. . There were some impressive firsts, including “Here Lies Love” with Broadway’s first all-Filipino cast, as well as mostly Filipino producers, including singer H.E.R., comedian Jo Koy and Black Eyed Peas’ Apl.de.Ap. And seven openly autistic actors starred in “How to Dance in Ohio,” a first for Broadway. . There are some coincidences, like that Huey Lewis & The News songs are heard in both his jukebox show “The Heart of Rock and Roll” and an unconnected musical of “Back to the Future.” Rachel McAdams, who made a breakthrough in the film version of “The Notebook,” is nominated for the play “Mary Jane” as the the musical version of “The Notebook” is also up for awards. Plus, “The Wiz” and “Wicked” now share Broadway, and Nazis were in both “Cabaret” and a musical about artist Tamara de Lempicka.. “I am really excited by the bravery. I’m really excited that there are so many writers and directors and composers that are interested in exploring new corners of storytelling, new communities to talk about and new ways to look at the world and new ways to see theater,"" says director Jessica Stone, who helmed the musical “Water for Elephants.”. ___.

NEW YORK -- Palestinian protesters vandalized locations associated with the Brooklyn Museum and the United Nations in New York City, throwing red paint across their entrances in opposition to the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.. Mayor Eric Adams posted on the social platform X on Wednesday that police are investigating after the homes of museum director Anne Pasternak and members of the museum’s board of trustees were hit.. He shared four images of a brick building splashed with red paint with a banner hung in front of the door that read: “Anne Pasternak Brooklyn Museum White Supremacist Zionist.”. “This is not peaceful protest or free speech.

A spokesperson for the New York Police Department declined to comment, saying the agency is investigating and will provide more information later.

The protest group didn't respond to an email seeking comment.. City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was among the New York politicians to speak out against the protests, said the Brooklyn Museum has done more to grapple with questions of “power, colonialism, racism & the role of art” than many other museums. . “The cowards who did this are way over the line into antisemitism, harming the cause they claim to care about, and making everyone less safe,” he wrote on X..

abcnews.com,"Movie Review: ‘Tuesday,’ with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, is strange, emotional and fiercely original",https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/movie-review-tuesday-julia-louis-dreyfus-strange-emotional-111062832,2024-06-12 13:26:41,"The new film “Tuesday"" is about death, and acceptance, between a mother and her dying daughter. Death has taken many forms in cinema. It’s been Bengt Ekerot. Ian McKellen. John Cleese. Even Brad Pitt with blonde highlights. But in “ Tuesday,” filmmaker Daina O. Pusić's bold, fantastical and affecting debut, death looks like a lot like a macaw that's seen better days.. Covered in a thick layer of grime and oil with patches of feathers missing, “Tuesday’s” Death can be as big as a room or as small as an ear canal. Its booming, gravelly voice (that of actor Arinzé Kene) sounds ancient and otherworldly. And it all adds up to something profoundly unsettling. Not exactly a comforting welcome into the afterlife, or whatever comes next. . “Tuesday,” expanding nationwide Friday, is about death, and acceptance, between a mother and her dying daughter. But this is no Hallmark affair fitting for a sympathy card. It is prickly, wry, somewhat unsentimental, a bit gritty and awfully painful at times. Or maybe it’s just uniquely British. And you may just find yourself in a puddle of your own tears as a result.. Now, in terms of cinematic emotional blackmail, a parent coming to terms with a child’s imminent death is pretty much in the red zone. That sort of setup could produce involuntary tears from an audience regardless of the level of talent involved. Thankfully for us, there is immense creativity and vision both in front of and behind the camera, including not just the writer-director but the special effects experts responsible for Death as well as the haunting and innovative sound design.. Lola Petticrew plays the titular Tuesday, a teen with a “Breathless” pixie cut, a love of jokes and rap music and a terminal illness that has bound her to an oxygen tank and the use of a wheelchair. Her mother, Zora ( Julia Louis-Dreyfus ), has entirely disconnected from the situation. She tiptoes around the house waiting for the nurse, Billie (a lovely Leah Harvey), to do the caretaking. She stays out all day, pawning household items for cash to pay for the care, ignoring Tuesday’s calls and occasionally falling asleep on park benches. At home, she doesn’t want to talk to Tuesday about anything real — the death, her job, their precarious financial position — it’s all been deeply repressed and compartmentalized and is making everyone crazy.. The day we meet Zora and Tuesday is the day Death arrives. Billie has left Tuesday on the patio for just a minute to start a bath. All of a sudden, the girl who was just joking around is having an episode, gasping for air, when the macaw lands by her side. Death is actually the first character introduced, in an unnerving series of deaths setting an ominous tone that will loom throughout. Some are ready to go, begging for relief. Some are just scared. And all have the same outcome once he’s put his wing around them.. Tuesday, however, decides to tell a joke. This disarms Death (who bursts out laughing) and suddenly they’re in conversation together. She gives him a bath, puts on some music and asks a favor: She’d like to say goodbye to her mom first. Death obliges.. Of course the story both is and isn’t that simple. “Tuesday” becomes some strange combination of body horror, fairy tale, domestic drama and apocalypse thriller. It is weird and transfixing — never predictable and never boring. Louis-Dreyfus is both chilling and deeply empathetic as this woman who has been paralyzed by grief even before it’s happened. She seems to be preparing for her own death in a way, unable and unwilling to process a life without her daughter who, at this point, doesn’t even realize that her mother still loves her. Petticrew holds her own, going head-to-head with Louis-Dreyfus at her cruelest, exhibiting a wisdom beyond her years and fitting of a person who’s had to grow up and face death far too early. . “Tuesday” is ultimately a cathartic affair, whether death is top of mind at the moment or not. And it announces the arrival of a daring filmmaker worth following.. “Tuesday,” an A24 release in theaters nationwide Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 111 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

abcnews.com,Movie Review: Peace (and pieces) of mind 'Inside Out 2',https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/movie-review-peace-pieces-mind-inside-2-111067825,2024-06-12 15:18:25,"Tempting as it is to consider any revisiting of “Inside Out” as sacrilegious, its sequel is deftly sensitive to one of the most complicated and awkward chapters of life, AP Film Writer Jake Coyle writes in his review. Sequels have been a touchy subject when it comes to Pixar, but it’s hard to deny the natural premise of “Inside Out 2.” It’s been nine years since “Inside Out,” yet in the span between that film and its new sequel, Riley, the young girl with a head full of emotions, has gone from 11 years old to 13. She’s just grown up a little.. Or maybe a lot. In the middle of the night, the old gang of Joy ( Amy Poehler ), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Tony Hale), Disgust (Liza Lapira) and Anger (Lewis Black) are roused from their beds by a soft beep, like a fire alarm in need of a new battery, but soon it’s sounding an all-out emergency. On their console a red light blinks. “What’s that?” one says. “Puberty,” the button reads. Soon, construction workers are swarming the control room for “demo day,” with wrecking balls making room for “the others.”. In come a new gaggle of emotions said to be more sophisticated: Anxiety ( Maya Hawke ), Envy ( Ayo Edebiri ), Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser) and Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos). The next morning, Riley wakes up to find herself unusually stinky. Life, as they say, comes at you pretty fast. “Inside Out 2” turns out to be not just a modest, inch-things-along sequel but a follow-up of cataclysmic proportions.. Tempting as it is to take any revisiting of “Inside Out” — a high water mark for not just Pixar but ’10s American movies — as sacrilegious, its sequel is deftly sensitive to one of the most awkward chapters of life. The giddy sense of imagination is a little less boundless this time. One could certainly look at “Inside Out 2” like a parent eyeing a teenager and thinking the younger version was cuter and less whiny. But the filmmakers of “Inside Out 2” have managed again to filter complex psychological developments into a bright, entertaining head trip that in its finest moments packs an emotional wallop.. I would peg Joy as the real protagonist of the first “Inside Out.” That movie, really, hinged on the blue-haired sprite’s desperate race to preserve all the happiness of childhood. Aided especially by Poehler’s brilliant voice work, Joy — a kind of stand-in for parents wanting only the best for their kids — was less just another emotion than an unflagging guardian learning that sometimes letting go is best. . This time, Riley feels more the main character, though Anxiety, an excitable, orange, bug-eyed Muppet-like thing, is increasingly calling the shots. Riley (voiced by Kensington Tallman) is now taller, has a few good friends and is still playing hockey. Her internal landscape is shifting, too. Boy Band Island is done, for one. And out of her pools of memories, new strands are growing a tree-shaped Belief System. Just who Riley is, at her core, gets tested and reshaped in “Inside Out 2.”. Some of the brain trust on the film are also new. Kelsey Mann, a longtime Pixar veteran, takes over directing from Pete Docter (now the Pixar chief) to make his debut feature. The script is by Meg LeFauve, who co-wrote the original, and Dave Holstein.. My recollections of “Inside Out” — if my memory orbs have been correctly filed — are mostly of all those glowing balls of the past and Joy and Sadness’ mad dashes through the back of Riley’s mind, a pun-filled inner space both literal and metaphorical. Plus, we can’t forget, Richard Kind’s voice as Bing Bong.. Much is the same in “Inside Out 2” (though, alas, Bing Bong sleeps with the fishes). But the film is a little more tilted outside Riley’s mind. As the school year is coming to a close, Riley heads to a weekend hockey camp that’s a preview of her high-school life to come.. New stresses are developing. Her pals (voiced by Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green and Grace Lu) are headed to a different school, Riley learns. On the ice, what was once carefree play is becoming a more complicated experience plagued by self-doubt. At camp, Riley really wants to impress an older star player named Val (Lilimar Hernandez). To do so, Anxiety, usurping Joy, increasingly sacrifices core beliefs to manically build Riley a new identity. Joy and others, booted from the control room, again have to work frantically to mount a resistance, while at the same time learning a lesson about the need to reconcile — not just try to forget — less happy memories.. “Inside Out 2,” which arrives after a period of soul-searching for Pixar, both recaptures some of the animation studio’s magic and reminds us that rekindling the ambitious spirit of Pixar’s heyday isn’t so easy. The sequel stays close to familiar neural pathways. There are new cerebral puns — the echoing depths of a Sar-""chasm,"" a brainstorm that rains light bulbs — and a new cartoon relic of childhood to replace Bing Bong: a character named Bloofy, voiced by Ron Funches. It’s easier to see where this “Inside Out” is headed and a little harder to be dazzled by what unfolds.. But it’s aim is remarkably true. Confronting the struggles and realities of anxiety, particularly for teenage girls, could hardly be a more laudable undertaking. And the care is taken here to illustrate how new impulses can run roughshod over a young person and throw their internal compass out of whack. . Pixar, like other studios wrestling with a new media landscape, has dabbled in recent years with more short-form and digital-friendly content. But Docter has steered Pixar back to focusing on feature films with robust theatrical releases. (“Inside Out 2” is to exclusively play for 100 days in theaters.) So in more ways than one, Mann’s movie feels like a much-needed feature-length refuge from today’s anxiety-producing devices. Unlike many of Pixar’s moving metaphors of parenthood, this one is, affectingly, for the kids.. “Inside Out 2,” a Walt Disney Co. release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for some thematic elements. Running time: 96 minutes. Three stars out of four.. ___. Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

Author Michael Brodeur takes the gym too seriously, and not seriously at all at the same time, in his book “Swole: The Making of Men and the Meaning of Muscles” in an effort to show the readers that the overly online world of hypermasculinity is an illusion and what a man can be is what you make of it. . Brodeur evokes his own autobiography to guide the reader through the history of weightlifting and the role of men in society. He's a middle-aged, Gen-X, self-described “meathead” who brags about the depths of his squats and size of his biceps and butt, but also lives a life as the classical music critic for The Washington Post and a gay man. . These dueling identities weave through Brodeur's “Swole."" The narrative works, most of the time, but sometimes Brodeur's chapters feel more like miniature essays surrounding a broader theme of masculinity than a comprehensive whole. . He celebrates male bodies and men wanting to be bigger, stronger, and uses humor and the history of idols like Arnold Schwarzenegger, He-Man, and professional wrestling to show how men's identities have evolved and changed since he was a child struggling to come to terms with his own sexual orientation. . Brodeur appears to reject the modern-day gym industry that often sells their version of the ideal body: A place where calorie counts are perfected, macronutrients are measured and microtargeting of muscle groups are a must. . Instead, Brodeur tells the reader to reach for the ideal you want — be comfortable looking at yourself in a mirror, and know it's also OK to be somewhat embarrassed about looking at yourself in a mirror. . Brodeur also warns about the rising influence that internet personalities like Andrew Tate or the Liver King are having on younger men, or the unending number of TikTok personalities that basically lay out easy ways for young men to purchase and abuse anabolic steroids. . “Adrift and allegedly emasculated by the mass rejection of ‘real masculinity,’” men are now balls-deep in an imaginary internet-based civil war with themselves,” he writes.. “Swole” allows men to celebrate masculinity as they want to define it. . ___.

NEW YORK -- The lapels are wide, “Disco Inferno” is blasting on the dance floor and lines and lines of nose candy are on offer in the new intriguing Miami-based series “Hotel Cocaine.”. The eight-episode romp on MGM+ centers on a real-life hotel at the beginning of the war on drugs that had a private nightclub known as a notorious hangout for show business types, CIA undercover agents and drug kingpins.. Creator and showrunner Chris Brancato, the creator of “Narcos” and “Godfather of Harlem,” explains the show using another hot hangout with war looming: ""I describe it as ‘Casablanca’ on cocaine."". “Hotel Cocaine,” set in 1978, centers on the hotel’s general manager, Roman Compte (played by Danny Pino), a Cuban expatriate who caters to high-end hotel patrons. He slowly gets sucked into a life of crime trying to protect his daughter from unsavory federal agents on one side, and his equally unsavory estranged brother, a mobster, on the other.. “This show has become about many things. It’s about immigration to this country and trying to achieve the American dream. It’s also about a man caught in a perilous moral quandary of trying to save his daughter at the risk of betraying his brother from whom he’s estranged.”. Leavening the darkness is plenty of humor, mocking the era's emphasis on personal growth through psychedelics and its partying excess. The scripts also have fun portraying real celebrities, like John Lennon, Liza Minnelli, John Bonham, Hunter Thompson and Rick James.. Brancato says he created a careful balance between a “meat and potatoes drug show” and comedy. “I wanted there to be a sense of humor to what is otherwise could be a kind of dark and very dreary subject matter,” he says.. The show also co-stars Yul Vazquez, Michael Chiklis and Mark Feuerstein. It was shot in the Dominican Republic, which “looks more like Miami of the '70s than Miami now,” says Brancato. . The series is enlivened by music from the era, including Latin sounds and pop classics, like Eric Clapton's “Cocaine.” Brancato managed to get the rights to use Dire Straits “Sultans of Swing” at a discount because singer-guitarist Mark Knopfler was a fan of “Narcos.”. “The hedonism and the party and the disco and the choreography and the dancing may seems frivolous, but there’s a life and death struggle happening underneath,” Pino says. . The action takes place inside and outside the Mutiny nightclub, which was the jewel of the 138-room Mutiny Hotel. The hotel still exists, the nightclub — which also inspired the movie “Scarface” — doesn't. . “You not only had the cocaine trade flowing through the Mutiny. But you had lawyers, money launderers and intelligence officers. All those roads converged in that little place,” says Vazquez, whose sister partied at the nightclub in her youth.. The show's hero also was a real man: Roman Compte. His son, “Narcos” actor Maurice Compte, brought his father's experiences to Brancato, who started fictionalizing. (Pino worked with the younger Compte on “Mayans MC” and asked him plenty of questions about his dad.). “For me, it’s not interesting to do these crime shows unless you can find some interesting new angles. So, for example, ‘Godfather of Harlem’ is the collision of organized crime and civil rights, two things that actually don’t really belong in the same sense.”. “Hotel Cocaine” reaches for authenticity by casting two Cuban Americans from Miami as the lead brothers and dealing with the legacies of Fidel Castro and the Bay of Pigs.. “It’s just filled with all kinds of buttons,"" says Vazquez, whose brother was a political prisoner in Cuba. ""I want to say it’s filled with memories, but it’s more than memories. It’s proper buttons. I jumped at wanting to do this.”. The show has as its tagline “every pleasure has a price” and Brancato says he hopes it might make viewers realize how much brutality goes into their recreational drugs. “We do these drugs, and we snort the cocaine, and we give no thought whatsoever to the fact that every line of cocaine has three dead bodies behind trailing back to South America,” he says.. Season one is wrapped and the cast hopes there's interest in another. After all, the '80s — where hedonism went nuts — beckons.. ""It sets up I think a lot of what we hope this show is going to be in terms of understanding maybe what we’re going through today as Americans — through the microscope of being able to analyze what happened in the ‘70s and ’80s,"" says Pino. . ___.

abcnews.com,"Françoise Hardy, French singing legend and pop icon, dies at 80",https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/franoise-hardy-french-singing-legend-pop-icon-dies-111052636,2024-06-12 21:18:15,"Françoise Hardy, a French singing legend and pop icon since the 1960s, has died. PARIS -- Françoise Hardy, a French singing legend and pop icon since the 1960s, has died. She was 80. . Her son, musician Thomas Dutronc, announced her death on social media, sharing a poignant photo of himself as a child with his mother. Hardy had lymphatic cancer since 2004 and died Tuesday.. Born on Jan. 17, 1944, in Paris, Hardy’s career began in 1962 when she recorded her first single, “Tous les garçons et les filles,” at the age of 18. The song, which she wrote and composed, quickly became a hit, marking her rise as a key figure in the yé-yé movement, a French response to rock ‘n’ roll. . Her lyrics often captured the angst and longing of adolescence, resonating deeply with young audiences. Her melancholic and introspective tone set her apart from the more exuberant pop music of her peers.. Hardy’s influence extended far beyond France. In 2023, she was the only French artist named in Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the 200 greatest singers of all time. Her ethereal voice and distinctive beauty captivated audiences, earning her praise from music legends such as Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. . “I was passionately in love with her. Every male in the world, and a number of females, also were,” Bowie once said.. Hardy had a unique approach to songwriting, emphasizing the importance of melody in her creative process. Speaking to the Associated Press in 1996 about writing songs, she explained, “I always put the words on the music. It’s always like that. I don’t write before, and then, I’m looking for music. First, I get the music and (then) I try to put words on it.” That method contributed to the distinctive quality of her music, blending poetic lyrics with evocative melodies.. Hardy was also celebrated as a fashion muse. Her androgynous looks and understated elegance made her a favorite of the fashion world, with a tall, slender frame, angular features, and long, straight hair. This aesthetic aligned with the modern fashion of the 1960s, emphasizing simplicity and a certain boyish charm. She often wore designs from André Courrèges, Paco Rabanne, and Yves Saint Laurent, in styles that defined the era. Her influence in fashion extended over decades.. Hardy’s relationship with fellow musician Jacques Dutronc was a significant part of her life and work. They met in the mid-1960s and had a son, Thomas, in 1973. Although their relationship faced challenges, including Dutronc’s infidelities and their eventual separation, it deeply influenced her music. Their lives — residing on separate floors of the same Parisian building — mirrored their bittersweet partnership, which was reflected in Hardy’s songs.. She also had a keen interest in astrology, authoring several books on the subject and hosting radio shows. Her lyrics and public persona often reflected her introspective nature and fascination with the celestial.. Hardy’s battle with cancer was long. She endured numerous treatments, including radiotherapy, which left her deaf in one ear. Despite her health struggles, she continued to produce music, with her final album, “Personne d’autre,” released in 2018. This album, marked by its contemplative themes and collaboration with the Finnish indie band Poets of the Fall, confronted issues of mortality.. Tributes have poured in from across the globe. French Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak hailed her as “an eternal legend of French songs,” while fellow musicians like Carla Bruni, Michel Polnareff, and Étienne Daho expressed their deep sorrow and admiration. International artists, including Blur’s Graham Coxon and Public Enemy’s Chuck D, also paid their homage.. Reflecting on her lifelong love for melodies, Hardy once said, “All my life, I’ve been on the lookout for beautiful melodies. Listening to them puts me in seventh heaven.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

BASEL, Switzerland -- Multimillion-dollar works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Yayoi Kusama and Alberto Giacometti went on the market this week as the Art Basel fair opened in Switzerland.. Thousands flooded the exhibition center for VIP previews before doors open to public Thursday. Arriving guests strolled through a large plaza filled with stems of wheat resembling a field, a work by conceptual artist Agnes Denes that was first staged in 1982.. More than 280 galleries exhibited everything from paintings and sculpture to video installations and performance art.. “Art Basel is like the Super Bowl of the art world,” art market expert Magnus Resch said.. The Art Market Report 2024, published by Art Basel and Swiss investment bank UBS, found that sales fell by 4% year-on-year in 2023, to an estimated $65 billion, against a backdrop of high interest rates, inflation and political instability.. Sales were particularly thinner at the top end of the market.. “We’ve seen a bit of a slowdown,” said UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief economist Paul Donovan.. Once the buzz of the art world, sales in art-related NFTs — or non-fungible tokens — on NFT platforms outside the art market declined sharply, according to the report, from a peak of $2.9 billion in 2021 to $1.2 billion last year.. But there is still enthusiasm. The report found transaction volume grew in 2023 by 4%, driven by sales at lower price levels.. “We’re not seeing art sales plunge off the edge of a cliff or anything like that,” Donovan said. “So ‘cooling’ is probably the right way to think about what is happening."". Austrian gallerist Thaddaeus Ropac said that “I think people are now reflecting a bit more, taking a bit of time, but they are still very, very active."". Some dismissed any dour analysis. In an opening day sales report, the president of international gallery Hauser & Wirth, Iwan Wirth, described it as “doom porn” while New York-based Sean Kelly said the market had already turned a corner since last year.. “There’s always something to be concerned about. But the market has proven to be extremely resilient,"" Kelly said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

TOKYO -- Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95.. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports.. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble.. In the U.S., Maki’s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. . Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo's Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for “the beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park."". In 2013, Maki complained about the then planned spaceship-like design of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadi.. “The problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,” he said.. That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by Kengo Kuma which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look.. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design.. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis.. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called “Nurturing Dreams” by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called “oku,” which Maki described as “the core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.”. Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory.. “In the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,” Maki wrote.. “Oku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.”. Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students Arata Isozaki and Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism.. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan.. “He uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,” Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time.. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal.. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned. His office declined to give details, saying an official announcement was being prepared.. ___. Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://twitter.com/yurikageyama. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — The Apollo Theater, a bastion of Black music and culture and one of New York City's most storied venues, celebrates its 90th anniversary this year. . On Tuesday, the historic theater held its annual spring benefit — its largest annual fundraising effort, this year raising $3 million — with a star-studded event featuring Usher, Babyface, Big Daddy Kane, Jordin Sparks and more. . Sparks opened the night with an impressive medley of Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition,” Aretha Franklin’s “Respect,” and Chaka Khan’s “I’m Every Woman.” Then Kym Whitley emerged as a hilarious host, joking about the producer Babyface, who was being honored, arguing that he should now be known as “Grown-man-face, sexy-face, kiss-your-face.” . Later, she'd offer her own transformative story at The Apollo, sharing with the audience that it was on that stage where she first made an appearance as a stand-up comedian on television. “If you can make it at The Apollo,” she said, “You can make it anywhere.”. Speeches were given by a number of Apollo representatives, including President/CEO Michelle Ebanks, chairman of the board Charles Phillips, executive producer Kamilah Forbes as well as New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.. But it was the performances that really got the crowd on their feet. Dancers treated Usher to a choreographed medley of his own songs, from “Yeah!” to “Burn,” “Caught Up"" to “Confessions Part II” and beyond.. Usher, who just a few months ago wowed audiences with his own career retrospective while headlining the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show, was presented with the Icon Award.. In his speech, he recalled watching “Showtime at The Apollo” with his late grandmother. “I remember thinking, ‘Man, someday I’m gonna make it to that stage,' and ‘hopefully one day, I’ll get a standing ovation,'” he said as everyone in the audience stood. “I stand before you humbled by your appreciation.” . “You know, they say if you make it in New York, you can make it anywhere,"" he continued, referencing Whitley's comments from earlier. “Well, if you can make it to The Apollo, you can do anything.”. Fat Joe and Kwanza Jones, formerly winners of The Apollo's famed Amateur Night, came out and led the crowd in a singalong of Babyface's 1989 hit, “Soon as I Get Home.” They were tasked with introducing the super-producer, who had been presented the day prior with the inaugural legacy award at The Apollo Theater's 2024 Walk of Fame ceremony.. “I never imagined I would get this,” Babyface said during Monday’s ceremony. “I never saw myself actually, you know, being here at The Apollo. I didn’t want to perform here because I didn’t want to get booed, but I didn’t get booed,” he laughed. “I’m so glad that I came here for The Apollo.”. On Tuesday, his acceptance speech mostly ditched the jokes to express gratitude. “To be here at The Apollo — what's so hard for me to find the words, because if I’m honest, I just never saw myself as like being on The Apollo stage. I was always the guy behind the scenes and writing songs for everyone else,” he said. “I am just in awe to be considered as part of this.”. “I'm just going to thank everybody. Normally I stand up here, I'm funnier than this,” he continued, “Usually, I am. But I'm just, I'm really just so taken by this, and I just want to thank you for the bottom of my heart. I appreciate it.”. The night ended with a series of singers coming out on stage to serenade Babyface with some of the most famous songs he produced: Toxi Braxton 's “You Mean the World to Me,” Eric Clapton's “Change the World,"" Whitney Houston's “I'm Your Baby Tonight” and so on. . Standouts included Karyn White doing her own “Superwoman,” Johnny Gill getting everyone out of their seats for his “My, My, My” and of course, Babyface himself closing the night out with “Whip Appeal.” They're called classics for a reason.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

NEW YORK -- National Amusements, which owns a majority voting stake in embattled entertainment giant Paramount Global, said Tuesday that it has ended talks on a possible merger of Paramount with movie production company Skydance Media. . The potential deal had drawn attention for weeks amid concerns about Paramount’s future given its heavy debt load and declining television business. One media report in early June even stated that Paramount and Skydance had agreed to terms of a deal, contingent only on signoff from Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone. A statement from National Amusements merely noted that the two sides “have not been able to reach mutually acceptable terms” for the deal.. Skydance, based in Santa Monica, California, has helped produce some major Paramount hits in recent years. Those include several Tom Cruise films including “Top Gun: Maverick” and installments of the “Mission Impossible” series. Its founder and CEO is David Ellison, the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison.. Robert Fishman, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, said the deal's collapse leaves Paramount with the same problems that have long weighed it down, and few prospects for an infusion of cash or new ideas to help turn things around. . “Ms. Redstone now seems set on either continuing the status quo or divesting herself of just her NAI stake, handing over the reins of her family’s empire to new stewards without delving into any broader or more complicated plan that would involve other media companies or shareholders,” Fishman wrote in a note to investors Tuesday.. Paramount has struggled in an evolving media landscape, particularly as its traditional cable business has declined. To capture today’s growing streaming audience, the company launched Paramount+ in 2021, but losses and debts have still piled up over time.. Shares in New York-based Paramount Global ended Tuesday down almost 8%.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

NEW YORK -- American investor Martin Shkreli is facing a new lawsuit for allegedly retaining and sharing recordings from a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album that he was forced to sell following his 2017 conviction on securities fraud charges. . The lawsuit was brought Monday by a cryptocurrency collective, PleasrDAO, which purchased the only known copy of the album from Shkreli for $4.75 million. The album, “Once Upon a Time is Shaolin,” has not been released to the public, functioning as a rare contemporary art piece since it was auctioned off by the famed hip-hop group in 2015. . In the lawsuit filed in Brooklyn, New York, federal court, PleasrDAO accused Shkreli of retaining digital copies of the album in violation of their deal and disseminating them widely among his social media followers. . They point to his recent comments on social media boasting of sharing the digital recordings with “thousands of people.” Over the weekend, Shkreli played portions of the album during a livestream he hosted on X, which he called a “Wu tang official listening party,” according to the lawsuit.. Shkreli did not respond to a request for comment. . The lawsuit marks the latest twist for an unusual album created in protest of the devaluation of music in the streaming era, but purchased at auction by Shkreli, a man known for jacking up the price of a life-saving drug and his “Pharma Bro” persona. . Shkreli was later forced to sell the album — packaged in a hand-crafted silver and nickel case and including a 174-page book wrapped in leather — following his conviction of security fraud charges. . PleasrDAO said it bought the physical copy of the album and its digital rights over two transactions, in 2021 and 2024. They said they understood that Shkreli had destroyed any trace of the album's files. . “Any dissemination of the Album’s music to the general public greatly diminishes and/or destroys the Album’s value, and significantly damages PleasrDAO’s reputation and ability to commercially exploit the Album,” the lawsuit states. . As of last month, the album was headed to the Australia’s Museum of Old and New Art, which said it planned to host private listening sessions featuring select tracks from the album beginning this week. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) — Billy Ray Cyrus has filed for divorce from singer Firerose after seven months of marriage. . The 62-year-old country musician filed for divorce from the 36-year-old whose legal name is Johanna Rose Hodges in a Tennessee court on May 22, citing irreconcilable differences and “inappropriate marital conduct."" Cyrus is also seeking an annulment due to fraud on Hodges' part, saying in the filing that he would not have married Hodges “had he known” about the alleged fraud. The filing gives no further details on the alleged inappropriate conduct of fraud, but says each should be able to keep property that they own separately.. Representatives for Cyrus and Hodges did not immediately return requests for comment. The filing was first reported Tuesday by TMZ.. After getting married in October 2023, the musicians lived in Tennessee and released several songs together over the course of their relationship. . In an Instagram post in April, commemorating their six-month anniversary, Hodges wrote “Life isn't always easy... but it sure helps when your husband's also your best friend. Thank you Lord!” . Neither Hodges nor Cyrus has commented on the divorce via their social media accounts. . Cyrus has been married twice before, notably to Tish Cyrus, with whom he shares five children, including musician and actor Miley Cyrus. They divorced in 2022 after nearly three decades together. They had previously attempted divorce twice during their relationship, but called it off in 2010 and 2013.. The 2022 divorce kicked off a highly publicized rift in the Cyrus family. When Miley won her first Grammy Award in February, she said “I don’t think I’ve forgotten anyone” after a long list of thank-yous and shoutouts to her family that included her mother, who was in attendance, but excluded her father and onetime “Hannah Montana” co-star. . ___.

Sign up for our Election Essential newsletter here. And we'll keep you signed in.. Sign in  or  Register. You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law..   Edited by Emily Atkinson and Owen Amos. All times stated are UK. McFadden is now played a clip from Sky last night, where Starmer was asked about his support for Jeremy Corbyn in 2019 (see below).. Starmer last night said that he was certain Labour would lose the 2019 election. . So McFadden is asked: Does Starmer lack judgment or backbone?. He replies that Starmer's comments simply reflects the changes that can be made when you become leader.. Starmer has changed the party, McFadden says, and that it shows that the party is now focused on the public and not the internal issues of the party. . The issue of trust is again put to McFadden, given recent figures that show the public's distrust in politicians. . Given Starmer's changed views on Corbyn, isn't hard to trust him? . McFadden again makes the point that the Labour party has changed - adding that Liz Truss is still a Tory candidate, but Corbyn is not.. McFadden is now asked about the two-child benefit cap. Angela Rayner and Gordon Brown have both criticised it, so why are Labour not committed to scrapping it?. McFadden says Brown was right to be careful before with his promises he went into government in 1997.. Rajan presses on: if senior figures in his own party say the cap pushes people into poverty, why not change it? . McFadden reiterates his point about Labour's promises in 1997 and then in government, but adds: ""You always have to start from the situation that you inherit, and we will inherit a difficult economic situation."". Continuing on council tax bands, Rajan asks how it makes sense to have tax bands in England based on 1991 property valuations.. Rajan points out that was the era of Mikhail Gorbachev and Chesney Hawkes.. McFadden reiterates that Labour has no plans to reconsider council tax - and says Rajan will have to ask the Conservative Party why they haven't revaluated it during their years in government.. ""The priority for us is to get the economy moving,"" he says.. McFadden is now asked about Tory plans to cut tax and ""put money back in people's pockets"". Will Labour announce any tax cuts? . McFadden says tax cuts have to be ""sustainable and affordable"", a lesson we should have learnt two years ago when Liz Truss ""crashed the economy"", he says.. He says Sunak was meant to be the antidote to Truss but instead Sunak is the latest instalment of the ""same fantasy economics"".. We are consciously taking a different approach, McFadden says. . Will you be recalculating council tax bands? Rajan asks.. There's nothing in the manifesto that requires any change in tax rates, McFadden replies. . McFadden is pressed on his claims of future growth - with Amol Rajan saying that, across the western world countries are struggling to increase growth.. McFadden points to Labour's record in the late 90s and 2000s, saying ""our credibility lies in our record"". . If that record had been maintained, there would be a lot more money for public services, he says.. What if the growth doesn't come? asks Rajan. Are they being straight with people about potential cuts?. McFadden say government is difficult, but says they will not accept defeat, and says their plans will make a difference to growth. . Pat McFadden is first asked about projections - including from the Resolution Foundation and the Institute for Fiscal Studies - that tax rises or spending cuts will be needed from the next government.. He says those estimates ""assume a static situation"" in regards to growth. The whole point of the Labour manifesto is a rejection of that assumption, he says.. He says the party doesn't believe that the growth rate in the future should be the same as it was in the past.. ""We can be more ambitious,"" he says.. It's launch day for the Labour manifesto - and sent out to make the pitch to voters this morning is the party's national campaign co-ordinator and shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden.. Like Cameron, he'll be speaking to both Today and BBC Breakfast - with Today first.. Stay with us for the key lines.. Lord Cameron is now asked why Conservative candidate Dame Andrea Jenkyns featured a photo of her with Reform UK leader Nigel Farage on her campaign leaflet. . Cameron refuses to be drawn on Farage's feature, but says Jenkyns had asked him for an endorsement for her leaflet, which he sent.. ""I hope that's on her leaflet as well,"" he says.. Cameron is now asked about the government missing a 2019 pledge to build 300,000 new homes a year. . It's also put to Cameron that Sunak himself admitted that under the Conservatives, it's harder to own your own home. . Cameron replies by saying that house building has seen a big increase in recent years due to reforms the government has introduced. . He adds that the Help to Buy scheme, which was introduced during Cameron's time as PM, has helped.. However, Cameron does concede that the government haven't built as many houses as they wanted to. . He's then asked if he feels sorry for Sunak as he's got to account for 14 years of Conservative government, from Cameron, to Boris Johnson and Liz Truss?. No, I don't feel sorry for him, Cameron replies. . The Today interview starts with a clip from a Sky election debate programme attendee, talking about Rishi Sunak's Partygate fixed penalty notice in 2022.. Cameron says Sunak said he made a mistake - and goes on to compliment the prime minister on his economic record.. Emma Barnett asks if the foreign secretary understands why some people haven't forgiven him? . ""Of course I understand that,"" he says. . It's a busy morning for the foreign secretary - he's now speaking to Emma Barnett on Today. Listen live by pressing the second Play button at the top of the page.. We'll have the key lines here.. Cameron is now asked about Craig Williams, a parliamentary aide to Rishi Sunak, who has admitted placing a bet on the election.. Cameron says this was a ""foolish decision"" and that Williams was being investigated by the Gambling Commission.. He adds that he won't comment further while that investigation is ongoing - but Williams will face consequences for his action.. Charlie Stayt now recites to Lord Cameron a statement he made as prime minister in 2013, where he said he would reduce migration to the ""tens of thousands"" (this was a repeated Conservative election pledge from 2010 onwards). . Stayt asks why should people trust the Tories on immigration.  . Lord Cameron says the UK has ""rightly"" welcomed over 250,000 Ukrainians over 150,000 people from Hong Kong. . And he adds the effects of Covid reduced the workforce significantly - meaning more migrants were needed.. Cameron is now asked about comments from Defence Secretary Grant Shapps yesterday, where he discussed a possible Labour ""supermajority"".. Why is he talking that way? Are you already defeated? asks Breakfast's Charlie Stayt..

bbc.com,"More funding and fairness for Wales, says Plaid",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggw27403lo,2024-06-13 06:31:35,"Wales needs more funding and ""economic fairness"" from Westminster, Plaid Cymru has said ahead of its general election manifesto launch later.. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said the general election was ""about one thing - the economy"".. He said Labour did not offer ""meaningful change"" after 14 years of ""Tory cuts and chaos"".. Plaid's manifesto, which is being launched in Cardiff, calls for the Welsh Parliament to have more power over natural resources and funding for public transport.. Wales is owed ""billions"" as a result of UK government spending on the HS2 railway from London to the West Midlands, Plaid said.. It is also calling for changes to how the Welsh government's budget is set in Westminster so funding matches Wales’ needs.. The party also wants control over the Crown Estate to be devolved so profits from its properties go to the government in Cardiff, not the UK Treasury.. All parties in the Senedd say the Welsh government’s budget should be topped up as a result of HS2.. But, under the Conservatives, the UK government has refused to classify the project in a way that would release more funding for Wales - and Labour has also not pledged to do so.. In March, Sir Keir Starmer said a Labour government would have to ""review that and make decisions when we are able to"".. Rishi Sunak has said money saved from cancelling the next phase of HS2 would be spent on electrifying the north Wales main line.. Mr ap Iorwerth said: ""We will fight every day for the billions owed to Wales from the HS2 high-speed rail project and for a fair funding model which funds our country according to need, not population.. ""On 4 July, we can send a message that Wales won’t be taken for granted any longer and that’s only by electing a strong group of Plaid Cymru MPs that will always demand fairness for their square mile and put Wales' best interests first in Westminster."". Speaking on the Today Programme, Plaid Cymru general election candidate Liz Saville Roberts said the party was also looking to re-enter the European Union. . She said Wales was ""kept in a state of continuous structural inequality within the United Kingdom"".. So the ""logical answer,"" she added, was to ""improve our relationship with our nearest neighbours, which of course is to re-join the single market and the customs union"".. After boundary changes, Plaid is defending two constituencies: Dwyfor Meirionnydd and Ceredigion Preseli.. It also hopes to fend off Labour and the Conservatives to gain another two target seats: Caerfyrddin and Ynys Mon.. Mr ap Iorwerth was appointed Plaid leader last June when his predecessor Adam Price stood down after a damning report into allegations of misogyny within the party.. Last month he led his party out of a co-operation agreement with Vaughan Gething's Welsh Labour government.. The party voted against First Minister Mr Gething in a no-confidence vote this month..

bbc.com,"Crime here is hurting, whatever the statistics say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7227ve4e9yo,2024-06-12 21:03:32,"On a terraced street in Middlesbrough, a teenager in a mask takes out a long kitchen knife from his trousers and says he’s prepared to use it. “It’s brutal round here, you have to be prepared, if you don’t stab them, they will stab you.”. He is part of a group of young drug dealers, and I have no reason to doubt him. One of them says he was 14 when he started. Why? Money - they talk openly about how much they can make from selling heroin and crack cocaine.. As if to emphasise the point, another in the group holds up small bags of white rocks, which he says are crack cocaine. They charge £10 a bag and say they can sell hundreds of bags every week.. “No-one is going to change it, the bobbies can’t change it,” one of the dealers says.. Wherever we went in Middlesbrough, people wanted to talk about the impact of drugs. On the Netherfields estate, we met Tony, proud to be from the town.. “I’ll show you something, we call it the penthouse,” he says excitedly. He shows me a small block of flats where nearly every window has been smashed out or boarded up.. And it’s not just the one - many more homes here have been vandalised and smashed. Tony is incandescent: “It’s degrading, we feel like a waste of space, like we’re non-existent.”. The demand for drugs is high. In 2022, the government estimated that there were more than 300,000 people dependent on heroin and crack cocaine in England. And between them, they were responsible for nearly half of all burglaries, robberies, and other acquisitive crime, like shoplifting.. The statistics  show that both the number of crimes recorded and the rate of crime has increased since before the pandemic, even if police say recorded crime (excluding fraud) fell by 1% in 2023 in England and Wales compared with the year before. Separately, the Crime Survey for England and Wales suggests that excluding fraud and computer misuse, crime has been steadily dropping since 2010.. It's a complex picture, but contributions to the BBC’s Your Voice, Your Vote project  told us that for many people, crime is a major issue that they want the politicians to fix. So we came to Middlesbrough to hear people’s experience of it here.. To many people who live in Middlesbrough, it certainly doesn’t feel like crime is falling. Last year, Cleveland police recorded the highest overall crime rate out of all forces in England and Wales, affecting 137 out of every 1,000 people.. I spent three days here, and found that crime numbers don’t tell the full story of what’s happening in communities like North Ormesby, who are desperate for help.. Aidan is in his 20s and has a young family to support. He works hard in a restaurant, grabbin. g every hour offered and he’s also set up his own business as a handyman. He says he sometimes works over 70 hours a week.. As we walk and talk, someone shouts “welcome to Beirut!“ Aidan says he’s desperate to succeed but admits to being scared in the place he calls home. He takes us to one street with about 50 homes, and we walk past smashed windows, boarded up windows, and homes with obscenities sprayed on the walls in red paint. He reckons that on this one street, about 20 homes have been burgled over the past four years.. Officially, fewer people are being burgled. The Crime Survey for England and Wales suggests that there are less than a fifth of the number of burglaries that there were back in 1995. But in 2023, Cleveland police recorded the second highest rate of theft and the second highest rate of violence against a person.. What Aidan says next explains a lot of the despair that people feel. “We’ve been burgled, the police never came out, all I got was a crime reference number.. “I’m paying more council tax, energy bills and rent than ever before but the services I’m getting back have decreased.”. The most recent annual Home Office data says that in the year to March 2023, fewer than 4% of burglary offences in England and Wales resulted in a charge, albeit this was up on the previous year. In North Ormesby, the part of Middlesbrough where Aidan lives, around 95 in every 100 crimes last year went unsolved.. Cleveland police say they’ve taken a proactive approach in Netherfields, imposing five dispersal orders and have arrested children as young as 12. CCTV now covers the estate and people here say the anti-social behaviour issues with teenagers is calming down. In North Ormesby and across the region, police say they are working closely with people in the community and working with multiple local agencies.. But in late 2022, the UK’s then lead for neighbourhood policing said officers were spending too much time taking care of social problems, and not enough on tackling crime. Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney, now retired, said officers could spend half their shifts working on behalf of other services.. She said it meant that victims were being failed and the criminal justice system was in crisis.. In North Ormesby we came across a classic example - a police van attending what we thought was an emergency call, only to realise it was a welfare check for a vulnerable woman called Kimberley.. “They’re not just here to help, they’re helping with the mental health. I’m ADHD, bipolar and emotional stability disorder,” she told us. “They’re really nice and they’ll sit with you and make you feel good.”. Less than half a mile away, on Kings Road, there is a parade of shops where locals told us there were thefts most days. It’s got so bad that the Candy Corner shop at the end of the road has started naming and shaming those accused of shoplifting, hanging a large canvas poster with their faces on it outside the shop. Under the faces it reads: “Steal from the shop and you will be our advert outside the shop for six months like these idiots.”. While we were on Kings Road, a group of five men stormed the supermarket, some with their faces covered. They were in and out in seconds and what did they steal? Chocolate bars.. Facing them behind the till was Ellie. “It was scary them coming in. I thought they were gonna take money,” she said. “It’s just the usual, every day,” she adds.. Ellie said the police usually only turn up if it happens a few times in a day. Speaking to her, it’s hard to believe anyone can be so accustomed to crime.. Shoplifting is up, especially in deprived areas. Offences recorded by police in England and Wales have risen to their highest level in 20 years.. More than 430,000 offences were recorded last year - up by more than a third compared with the previous 12 months to December 2022, according to the police figures.. Nearby we met a business owner who said they had started slapping thieves who tried to steal from their shop. They wanted to remain anonymous, but showed me CCTV of one incident. They said they feared that they couldn’t rely on police, so preferred to take matters in their own hands. When I asked about the risk of arrest, they said it was a risk worth taking to protect their livelihood.. Others are taking desperate measures too. Sarah, who runs Legends Bar in the town, says the bar has been targeted five times in two years, and shows us CCTV from the last break in. “You can see where they pulled the shutters, they tipped over a fruit machine worth thousands of pounds. They’ve done a lot of damage, it makes you feel sick.”. On that occasion, thieves stole two bottles of vodka and the Christmas tip jar. Sarah doesn't know of anyone being prosecuted for the thefts or damage at her bar, and on some occasions no longer claims on her insurance. She says crime is her number one issue this election.. “One day they came in and nicked my KP Nuts. Nuts! It’s horrendous.” She says she has started sleeping in the bar overnight sometimes, and has turned to Facebook to try to solve the crimes, and even offered rewards with her own money.. “Next time do I even ring the police? Do I just leave it? It can’t keep going on like this.”. Later I meet Meela outside her home, chatting with neighbours in Netherfields.. “As soon as I’m out of this area I’m a different person,” Meela says. “As soon as I get to the roundabout coming in, I get anxiety."". I ask her whether politics can fix this. No, she says. “It’s the drugs, people need to knock down the drugs.”. In just England alone there is a lot to fix. An independent review conducted for the government by Dame Carol Black in 2021 said drug misuse costs society almost £20bn a year, which is close to £350 for every man, woman, and child in England.. That means even if you’ll never visit Middlesbrough in your life, illegal drug dealing does impact on your life. When public spending on services we all need is tight, money spent on drug misuse is cash that is missing from other vital services.. Back in North Ormesby I wondered what this general election means to the teenage drug dealers, who tell me they are old enough to vote. One says they don’t know what it is all about. I also ask, if politicians say they want to crack down on drug dealing, what would you say to them? “Catch me if you can,” one says, and then they all start to laugh.. Is this all they want from life I ask? They are after all just teenagers. One of them takes time to answer. “I don’t want to sell drugs, for the rest of my life, no one does, it’s just how it is,"" he says.. Nationally, crime is not the biggest election issue. Concerns around the cost of living, the NHS, the economy and immigration all poll higher.. But in places like North Ormesby and Netherfields concerns about crime are very real. People are desperate for help. Before we leave, Tony tells me: “Whoever wins the next election needs to step up to the mark, this cannot continue.”.

bbc.com,Delays for cancer treatment becoming routine,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckrrll51xjdo,2024-06-12 23:42:11,"Long waits for cancer care are becoming routine across the UK with nearly half of  all specialist cancer centres experiencing delays most weeks, the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) has said.. The college has warned of an “impending crisis” in the cancer workforce, with a “staggering” 30% shortfall in radiologists and 15% shortfall in clinical oncologists.. The Conservative Party said it would meet current targets for cancer care in England by the end of the next parliament, if re-elected. . Labour has said it will double the number of scanners to improve early detection, while the Liberal Democrats said they would introduce a legal guarantee for all patients to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral in England.. . The RCR report was based on responses from senior managers at 60 specialist cancer centres in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.. The survey, carried out in November 2023, found the number of centres experiencing severe delays had almost doubled in a year.. Managers at 47% of sites said patients needing chemotherapy and other cancer drugs were facing delays “most weeks or every week”, up from reports of delays at  28% of sites the previous year.. Centres reporting weekly delays to radiotherapy also nearly doubled, from 22% in 2022 to 43% in 2023.. Almost all clinical directors surveyed said workforce shortages were causing backlogs.. “We simply do not have enough doctors to manage the increasing number of patients safely, and this problem will only worsen as demand continues to rise and more doctors leave the NHS,” said RCR president Dr Katharine Halliday.. Health systems across all four nations of the UK have been missing targets for cancer treatment since before the Covid pandemic.. The latest NHS data, from March, showed the proportion of patients in England waiting less than 62 days to receive their first cancer treatment was 69% against a target of 85%.. New analysis from Cancer Research UK has found that 382,000 cancer patients had not been treated within the prescribed time in England since December 2015, when the target was last met.. The charity is calling for the next government to draw up a long-term cancer strategy for England, with a plan to address shortages in the cancer workforce and increase capacity in the system.. “All political parties should commit to a long-term, fully-funded strategy to back cancer research across the UK, and improve and reform cancer services in England,” said the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, Michelle Mitchell.. “Without this, cancer patients will not receive the level of care that they deserve.”. NHS England says the number of patients waiting longer than 62 days for treatment is now the lowest it has been since April 2020, and it has been meeting another target, for diagnosing cancer or ruling it out within 28 days.. Rosemary Head, 83, from Langdon Hills in Essex, said she had to wait eight months to be diagnosed with lung cancer. . She had treatment on her tumour in January but has not yet been told the results, so has no idea if it was effective. . Her follow-up appointment has now been pushed back to October.. Her daughter Jackie said: ""I've seen my mother get to the point where she just can't deal with this anymore because it's so frustrating, and that really angers and upsets me."". The cancer charity Macmillan said NHS data shows ""far too many people"" are waiting too long for potentially life-saving scans and treatment.. Health is a devolved matter, with policies outside England set by ministers in the Scottish and Welsh governments, and the Northern Ireland executive, not Westminster.. However, decisions on NHS spending taken in Westminster trigger an automatic payment - or allocation - to the devolved administrations who must co-ordinate their policies accordingly.. In England:. The annual Walk for Wards event supports projects to make patients more comfortable. Luke Wilkinson says running became an ""outlet"" while caring for his parents during the pandemic.
. Alex Wysocki was 24 when he was diagnosed with EGFR-positive lung cancer and died weeks later.. Madi Foster says the success of the fundraiser means she can fly to America for treatment.. Christine Campbell has lived longer than doctors predicted - and she's determined to keep going.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,Sandy Hook survivors graduate from high school,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg33zqd5wyeo,2024-06-13 03:01:37,"More than a decade after a mass shooting in a quiet Connecticut suburb, a group of survivors from Sandy Hook Elementary School are graduating from high school.. Twenty students and six staff members were killed in the shooting on 14 December 2012.. The youngest among them were six years old.. A private ceremony was held on Wednesday evening at Newtown High School, which around 60 survivors attended.. Graduating students spoke of complex emotions surrounding the milestone.. ""The shooter actually came into my classroom. So I had to, like, watch all my friends and teachers get killed, and I had to run for my life at six years old,"" Emma Ehrens told CBS News, the BBC’s US partner.. ""Just growing up with having the fear, and the what-ifs of what could have happened if I stayed?” she said. “Because I was, like, I was going to be next."". Another survivor, Lilly Wasilnak, said: “You wait for this day for your whole life, since you're in kindergarten. You just can't wait to graduate. And it felt so far away for such a long time… but I think we can't forget about that there is a whole chunk of our class missing.”. A number of the survivors have volunteered for gun control groups and several met Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House last week.. The mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary was carried out by a 20-year-old armed with two rifles and a handgun. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot as police arrived on the scene.. The US president at the time, Barack Obama, later called it “the single darkest day of my presidency”.. Following the murders, Mr Obama proposed a large raft of new laws designed to curb gun violence. . Although he implemented a series of reforms to the US background check system using executive orders, two major pieces of legislation failed to pass Congress.. The laws would have banned assault rifles and instituted background checks on most private gun sales. They had bipartisan support, but most Republican senators along with a number of Democrats voted against the measures.. The Sandy Hook shooting remains the deadliest ever at a US primary school. . Since the attack, there have been more than 4,200 mass shootings in the United States, including several dozen at schools, CBS reported.. A spokeswoman declines to comment, though President Joe Biden has already said he will not pardon Hunter. . The story of the white buffalo is key to the religion of many Native American tribes in North America.. Some 300 black people were killed in the 1921 massacre - but nobody has been held responsible.. The US broadens Russia sanctions, including a fresh crackdown on banks and tech.. ""What if they were able to walk the stage with me?"" wonders one teenage survivor of the 2012 shooting..

European Athletics Championships 2024: Keely Hodgkinson wins 800m gold. Keely Hodgkinson defended her European 800m title with a dominant victory despite struggling with illness, as Great Britain also won women's 4x100m relay gold on the final night of action in Rome.. Hodgkinson, 22, led throughout and held off her rivals in the closing stages to win in one minute 58.65 seconds.. However, following her victory the Olympic and two-time world silver medallist revealed she had become unwell a day earlier.. ""Sometimes you’ve just got to find a way to win,"" Hodgkinson told BBC Sport.. ""I wanted to go out and get a good time today but I'm happy with the win. I think I would have been disappointed if I didn’t try."". In a golden conclusion to the six-day championships for the British team, the women's 4x100m relay quartet featuring Dina Asher-Smith, Desiree Henry, Amy Hunt and Daryll Neita also triumphed. . Led off by 100m champion Asher-Smith and brought home by 200m silver medallist Neita, they took victory in 41.91secs, ahead of France and the Netherlands.. Asher-Smith told BBC Sport: ""That felt amazing, we are definitely trying new things before the Olympic Games. Obviously, we are looking to absolutely do amazing in Paris."". Neita said: ""To finish the championships with a gold medal with these amazing ladies, it’s just an incredible feeling, really electric and I really have a good feeling going into Paris."". Those golds helped the British team finish third in the medal table, with four golds and 13 medals in total, as hosts Italy topped the final standings ahead of France.. Also at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday, there were golds for Sweden's pole vault world record-holder Armand Duplantis and Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen, as Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs and Dutch star Femke Bol shone for their relay teams.. This video can not be played. European Athletics Championships: Great Britain win women's 4x100m relay gold. This was Hodgkinson's second major outdoor title following success in Munich two years ago and comes before she targets a first global title at Paris 2024.. With both a personal best and season's best time more than three seconds faster than anyone else in the final, she could hardly have lined up as a stronger favourite to defend her European crown.. While she did not win by the margin perhaps expected - having run a world-leading time of 1:55.78 to beat world champion Mary Moraa in Eugene this year - Hodgkinson always appeared in control as she collected the eighth major medal of an already stunning senior career, which only started in 2021.. The supremely talented Briton has been pushing the world's best since contesting her first major championships at the Tokyo Olympics.. Following that stunning breakthrough silver at those Games three years ago and successive world silvers since, Hodgkinson's eyes are now fixed on gold in Paris, where she is once again expected to battle Moraa and American Olympic champion Athing Mu for global supremacy.. ""I’m super excited for Paris. The next seven weeks are going to be incredible,"" Hodgkinson said.. ""I do believe in the power of manifestation, so it’s obviously something I think about. The Olympic Games are so special, it's a huge opportunity to change your life and I’m just ready to go for it."".

Britain's rising sprint star chasing Olympic dream . Duplantis hoped to produce a grand finale in Rome as all eyes were fixed on his world record attempts after the 24-year-old had already safely secured a third successive European title.. As the only athlete to clear 5.92m, Duplantis registered a first-time clearance at 5.97m, and again at 6.10m to win the 'Golden Crown' - awarded to those who produced standout performances in the Italian capital, along with 50,000 euros (£42,000). . With the prize money secure, the bar was lifted to 6.25m as Duplantis took his latest three attempts at breaking the world record for a ninth time, but it was not to be on this occasion.. Ingebrigtsen completed a third successive European golden double as he added the 1500m title to the 5,000m crown he successfully defended on Saturday.. The 23-year-old is the reigning Olympic champion over 1500m and is preparing for an expected gold-medal showdown with Britain's world champion Josh Kerr in Paris in eight weeks' time.. He was allowed to control the pace before bursting clear to win his 11th European track title both indoors and outdoors in a championship record 3:31.95..

bbc.com,Buenos Aires rocked by clashes over Milei reforms,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c255zdlde92o,2024-06-13 06:10:21,"Argentina's Senate has narrowly approved President Javier Milei's controversial economic reform package, with the vote taking place as violent clashes raged between protesters and riot police outside Congress.. Demonstrators in Buenos Aires - who say the measures will hurt millions of Argentines - threw petrol bombs and stones, setting cars alight.. A number of people were reported injured, with local media describing the scene on Wednesday as a ""battlefield"".. The reforms, aimed at reviving the country's flagging economy, include declaring a state of economic emergency, cutting pensions and watering down labour rights.. Mr Milei, a right-wing economist, was elected in the midst of a deep economic crisis which he is still struggling to stem after six months in office.. Annual inflation is currently close to 300%, while more than half of Argentines are now living in poverty.. Mr Milei's ""shock"" measures are opposed by leftist political parties, labour unions and social organisations.. But the motion, which was initially tied 36-36 in the Senate, was preliminarily passed on Wednesday after the head of the chamber, Vice-President Victoria Villarruel, broke the tie.. ""For those Argentines who suffer, who wait, who do not want to see their children leave the country... my vote is affirmative,"" Ms Villaruel said after breaking the tie.. The 328-article bill will now be surveyed point by point before its expected full approval on Thursday. . It will then return to the lower house for the final go-ahead.. Ahead of the bill's passing in the Senate, protesters chanted: “The country is not for sale, the country is defended,"" while one banner read: “how can a head of state hate the state?”. Scuffles broke out when protesters tried to make their way towards Congress through fences, with demonstrators throwing rocks at officers who pepper sprayed them.. Observers and opposition MPs said dozens of demonstrators and a handful of MPs received medical attention. At least five opposition MPs in the crowd were hospitalised, legislator Cecilia Moreau told AFP news agency.. At least 20 police officers were also injured, officials said. Security forces said they arrested 15 people..  ""We cannot believe that in Argentina we are discussing a law that will put us back 100 years,"" Fabio Nunez, a 55-year-old protesting lawyer, was quoted by AFP as saying.. President Milei's office issued a statement thanking the security forces for repressing what it described as ""terrorists"" attempting to carry out a coup d'état.. “We are going to change Argentina, we are going to make it the most liberal country in the world,"" Mr Milei told a conference in Buenos Aires.. The highly divisive bill was approved by the lower house in April, after significant amendments were made to it.. Mr Milei came to office in 2023 after vowing to take a chainsaw to public spending.. While on the campaign trail, he even brandished a chainsaw while making a speech to symbolise his determination to do so.. He has since cut the cabinet in half, slashed 50,000 public jobs, suspended new public works contracts and ripped away fuel and transport subsidies.. Schools, banks and many shops close across the country, with train and metro services suspended.. The Argentine leader tells the BBC that the ""political caste"" is bearing the brunt of his reforms.. Stuffing your greenbacks into the ""mattress bank"" is a way of life for many Argentines.. The banking giant is set to take a billion-dollar loss by exiting Argentina after nearly 30 years.. The new president's radical measures to overhaul the economy are loved by some, loathed by others.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,G7 plans to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2203d44rlo,2024-06-13 06:56:41,"Leaders from seven of the world's richest nations are gathering in Italy for a summit expected to agree a plan to use frozen Russian assets to raise billions of dollars for Ukraine.. The US proposal could raise $50bn (£39bn) a year for Ukraine, as well as applying fresh economic pressure to Russia.. Also expected to be on the agenda at the G7 summit are the war in Gaza, migration, economic security and artificial intelligence (AI).. The summit comes as a number of leaders - including Rishi Sunak, Emmanuel Macron and Joe Biden - face electoral challenges back home.. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is down in the polls ahead of a general election next month.. Also facing the voters in a matter of weeks is the party of French President Emmanuel Macron, who called a snap parliamentary election after a resounding loss to the far-right National Rally in last weekend's elections to the EU's parliament.. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden themselves could face defeat the next time voters head to the polls.. Italy's Giorgia Meloni has boasted that her country was heading into this summit with “the strongest government of all”, after a strong performance in the European elections last weekend.. The US proposal for Ukraine would see Kyiv granted the money in a loan, secured by the interest on the $325bn of Russian assets that the group, alongside the EU, froze after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.. Under international law, countries cannot confiscate those assets from Russia and give them to Ukraine.. It is hoped that if passed, the plan would give cash-starved and war-weary Ukraine another vital lifeline.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to attend the conference and will sign a new security arrangement with the US.. With President Biden in the middle of a close election contest himself, and several other Western leaders lagging in the polls, there is pressure to deliver support to Ukraine while they still can.. Elsewhere, Mr Sunak is set to announce up to $309m in support for Ukraine's energy and humanitarian needs.. Before heading to Puglia, he said that allies had to be ""decisive and creative in our efforts to support Ukraine and end [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal war at this critical moment"".. But the shaky political situation in many G7 countries is causing some observers to have low expectations about what can be achieved.. Natalie Tocci, the director of the Italian Institute for International Affairs, warns that, “if anything will come out of this summit, it’s the fear of a catastrophe playing out before our eyes,” with possible new governments led by Donald Trump in the US and the far-right in France on the horizon.. Also on the agenda is the climate crisis, migration from Africa to Europe, the war in Gaza and AI.. Pope Francis - who will become the first pontiff to attend a G7 summit - will be addressing the subject of artificial intelligence at the conference.. He has previously called for global regulation of AI, warning of its danger to ethics and human rights.. PM Giorgia Meloni will welcome other world leaders to Puglia after election success for her party.. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the vote could have ""serious consequences"" for France.. Leaders of the G7, the world's richest nations, meet to discuss the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.. As France calls for a snap election, other European countries weigh their gains and losses.. The French leader lost to the far right then called an election, in one of many big stories across the EU.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,Taylor Swift fans make the earth move at Edinburgh gig,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgg81939g2o,2024-06-13 05:07:13,"Thousands of Taylor Swift fans made the earth move by cheering and dancing at her three Edinburgh concerts last weekend.. Fans took the singer's encouragement to Shake It Off literally, with monitoring stations detecting seismic activity from 6km (3.73 miles) away.. The energetic Swifties made the biggest commotion during three songs: Cruel Summer, Ready For It? and champagne problems.. And it seems the 73,000-strong Friday night crowd danced, cheered and stomped the loudest of the three gigs.. It marked the first of 17 UK dates for Swift, which will culminate in a record-breaking eight-night run at London’s Wembley Stadium.. The 152-date stadium tour is on track to make more than $2bn (£1.56bn) by the time it wraps up in December, making it the most lucrative concert tour in music history.. During her three Murrayfield performances, Swift played to 200,000 fans who came from all over the world to see her career-spanning, three-hour show.. The Friday night concert was the most energetic by a small margin with fans making the ground move a maximum of 23.4 newton-meters (nm), compared to 22.8nm and 23.3nm on the Saturday and Sunday respectively.. The seismic activity was mainly caused by dancing and reached its peak at 160bpm during Ready For It?. The Swifties created approximately 80kW of power during the song, equivalent to around 6,000 car batteries.. Shake It Off and Cruel Summer made the ground move, but detectors even shook during a four-minute long applause for champagne problems.. Swift's previous tour dates in Seattle and Los Angeles registered similar events, with her Seattle gig generating activity equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.. The British Geological Survey (BGS) is the UK's national earthquake monitoring agency and its detectors are sensitive enough to pick up the smallest seismic activity miles away.. Callum Harrison, BGS seismologist, said: ""It’s amazing that we’ve been able to measure the reaction of thousands of concert goers remotely through our data. . ""The opportunity to explore a seismic activity created by a different kind of phenomenon has been a thrill.. ""Clearly Scotland’s reputation for providing some of the most enthusiastic audiences remains well intact!"". The movement was detected at two monitoring stations, and the furthest away of which was 6km away at the BGS office at Heriot Watt University.. However experts said the movement generated by the concert was unlikely to have been felt by anyone other than those in the immediate vicinity.. The ""Swiftival"" is designed to bring a taste of the star's The Eras Tour to Long Sutton.. Fans, students and academics came together to analyse the star's songs ahead of the Eras tour arrival. . So make the friendship bracelets... have you secured tickets to see Taylor Swift in Cardiff?. Organisers of Harry Styles walking tours add an extra date due to ""overwhelming demand"" from Swifties.. There are travel disruption alerts as tens of thousands of fans get the party started with Pink.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,Musk says Tesla investors back his multi-billion dollar pay deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cleezyxjv4jo,2024-06-13 05:53:08,"Tesla boss Elon Musk says shareholder votes on a record-breaking payout to the multi-billionaire and a plan to move the firm's legal headquarters to Texas are ""currently passing by wide margins"".. Tesla shareholders have been voting on several proposals, including one that could confirm a pay deal for Mr Musk, that was worth $56bn (£43.8bn) when it was first agreed in 2018.. The company is due to make an official announcement on the result of the vote at a meeting on Thursday.. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News.. In a post on social platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Mr Musk thanked his supporters.. However, legal experts say it is not clear if a court that blocked the deal will accept the re-vote, which is not binding, and allow the company to restore the pay package.. Earlier this year, a Delaware judge voided the compensation deal after a small investor sued.. The judge ruled the sum was ""unfair"" and the process for determining the package, by a board dominated by Mr Musk, was ""deeply flawed"".. Tesla called the decision ""fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders"".. The company then submitted the deal to another vote - and asked its shareholders to back a plan to reincorporate the company outside the state of Delaware.. The board has said Mr Musk deserves the package because Tesla achieved its ambitious targets under his leadership and that it is necessary to ensure he remains dedicated to the company.. Tesla executives also expressed support for the package in social media posts, saying that Mr Musk is crucial to the company's success. . Meanwhile, Mr Musk promised a personal tour of Tesla's factory in Texas to some shareholders who cast votes.. The package - worth an estimated 300 times what the top-earning boss in the US made last year - won backing from 73% of shareholders who voted six years ago.. Three areas in Essex are particularly low on places to plug in a car, the council says.. How artificial intelligence is increasingly helping the arable farming sector.. The decision comes as an investigation continues into what the EU calls China’s ""unfair subsidisation"".. The company said it had sold all 75 million shares it had offered to investors..

The 37-year-old has told the BBC his mental health was affected by the aftermath of the Nottingham attacks - which also claimed the lives of 19-year-old students Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber.. The son says he is still coming to terms with losing his father Ian.. He and the families of the other victims have vowed to continue their ""pursuit for justice"" on a day where a number of events are planned across the city to mourn their loss.. ""I was getting - I don’t know if you call it PTSD - but I’d close my eyes and all I could envision was what happened that night,"" he said.. ""You can’t help but let that run through your head and how your dad was left lying there."". The 37-year-old said he thought he could start ""dealing with the grief"" after Calocane's trial but said he ""didn't get any closure"".. ""I think after that, that’s where it started affecting me a lot more and I could see it really got to my mental health."" . Calocane was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. . The CPS said medical experts provided ""overwhelming"" evidence that he was suffering from a serious mental health condition at the time of the attacks. . His sentence was challenged by the victims' families but judges ruled in May that it was not unduly lenient, after the attorney general referred it to the Court of Appeal for review.. Mr Coates's youngest son said he had been ""very, very angry"" but is now in a better place, adding: “I never thought about my dad every day before. I definitely do think about him everyday now. . ""So before I leave my apartment, there’s a picture of my dad and I kind of [tell myself] 'I’m going to do you proud', like he did me proud.”. On Thursday, Huntingdon Academy in St Ann's, where Mr Coates worked as caretaker, is hosting a special day in his memory. . His son said: ""He wouldn’t want his name on anything. He’s very quiet, he likes to be that background character, that just makes sure everyone else is alright."" . He added that the love he and his family had received from the city had helped ""more than words ever could""..

It was about seven o’clock in the morning and you could sense something very serious had happened. . For a moment it seemed like the clocks had stopped ticking – with no trams or buses running and rush hour traffic unable to get through.. Everyone who became stranded in the city centre left on foot, power-walking to work or school.. The shocking scenes in our city made national news before we even knew what was really going on - and then the more we learned about it, the worse it got.. Our shock and worry soon turned into grief, and thousands of us descended to Old Market Square to pay our tributes to Barnaby, Grace and Ian..

bbc.com,Valance and Wintour host rival Trump-Biden London events,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxee43mdd60o,2024-06-13 01:01:57,"The US election campaign came to London on Wednesday evening, with an Aussie pop star and the editor of Vogue hosting rival fundraising events to reel in thousands of dollars in donations.. Holly Valance, the former Neighbours actress who topped the pop charts in the early 2000s, was expected to host the pro-Donald Trump event in West London at which ticket prices started at $10,000 (£7,800), one guest told the BBC. . Vogue’s editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, meanwhile, hosted a fundraiser in support of Joe Biden's campaign, a Biden campaign official confirmed. Tickets were said to cost $1,000 each.. Only US citizens and permanent residents were able to make donations.. Donald Trump's son, Donald Jr, was among the guests at the Republican fundraiser. He said afterwards it had been “incredible” and had raised lots of money, CBS News reported.. Asked about the Hunter Biden guilty verdict, he said it was a ""decoy to cover up all the actual corruption that was going on in that administration"".. Trump's ally Nigel Farage, the Reform UK party leader, also attended the event. . Greg Swenson, the chairman of Republicans Overseas, confirmed to the BBC that tickets cost from $10,000-$100,000. . For dinner, it was $50,000 per couple. Mr Swenson acknowledged it was a ""big-ticket"" event, but insisted the Republicans were the ""party of the people"" and highlighted the entry fees for rival Democratic events. . The most expensive tickets for one of Mr Biden's events in New York in March cost half a million dollars each.. Speaking before the fundraiser, Mr Swenson said he would be ""surprised"" if Trump Sr did not make a virtual appearance, having been at other events at which the ex-president ""chimes in"".. The London location was near the Chelsea Embankment in an exclusive area. At the door, a man in a suit and umbrella welcomed guests dropped off in front of polished black gates on Wednesday.  . The property’s website describes the venue as a “hub for entertainment and relaxation”, including wine cellar, swimming pool, spa and IMAX cinema.. Not everyone at the site felt warmly toward Trump, however - a woman with an American accent shouted “vote Biden” from a building nearby.. Trump has lagged behind his rival in fundraising efforts during the race so far, but his recent conviction in a New York hush-money trial prompted donations of tens of millions of dollars, according to his campaign team. . The party was ""killing it with small donations"", Mr Swenson said, after Americans were left ""shocked at the justice system"".. Valance, 41, is perhaps better known to millions in Britain and Australia for her 2002 song Kiss Kiss, and its racy video that took the pop world by storm. . She been linked to Mr Farage and Trump since being pictured alongside the two politicians in 2022, along with her entrepreneur husband Nick Candy.. There was no immediate response to a BBC request for comment that was sent to the Candy Foundation, the couple's charity.. Few details were available about the rival Democratic event hosted by Anna Wintour.. The timing of the rival London events was pure coincidence, insisted Sharon Manitta, global press secretary for Democrats Abroad. . Ms Manitta said her organisation - which operates separately from the Biden campaign - had organised a further event, a comedy night in Greenwich, for which tickets were selling for the more modest sum of $60.. ""We figure we need a bit of comedy now in this craziness,"" she told the BBC.. PM Giorgia Meloni will welcome other world leaders to Puglia after election success for her party.. A spokeswoman declines to comment, though President Joe Biden has already said he will not pardon Hunter. . Mr Garland becomes the third attorney general in US history to be held in contempt of Congress..

bbc.com,£8m Longitude Prize won for tackling superbug rise,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crggj9led0no,2024-06-12 19:22:48,"The £8m Longitude Prize has been won after a decade-long competition to find new tools to tackle the scourge of superbugs. . It has been awarded for a test that rapidly detects whether an infection is caused by bacteria and identifies the right antibiotics to treat it. . The test takes 45 minutes, compared with three days using traditional methods. . The original work was done by Swedish researchers and the test is now being sold by the company Sysmex Astrego.. The Longitude Prize - with a financial reward nearly 10 times that of a Nobel - was inspired by a contest in 1714.. It was won by John Harrison, who developed a precise clock allowing sailors to pinpoint their position at sea - one of the greatest challenges of the 18th Century.. Fast forward 300 years - and the modern blight of superbugs was the focus. . Infections that resist the drugs used to treat them are estimated to kill more than a million people every year. It is known as the silent pandemic. . “Without antibiotics, modern medicine as we know it is in real danger of collapse,"" UK special envoy on antimicrobial resistance Dame Sally Davies says.. Every time an antibiotic is used creates an opportunity for bacteria in the body to evolve resistance to it. . Resistance gives those bacteria a survival advantage and they spread, which is why the life-saving drugs should be used only when it is certain they will work.. The test works in urinary tract infections, which affect most women at some point and account for a fifth of antibiotics prescribed in England. . When the patient first arrives in hospital, or at a doctor's surgery, it is not easy to tell if their infection is caused by bacteria, viruses or even fungi.. Doctors can send a sample to a clinical microbiology laboratory - but this means growing the bacteria on a petri dish and can take three days to reveal the cause and which antibiotics the infection may be susceptible to.. In the meantime, antibiotic treatment is often started anyway because of the risk of symptoms becoming much worse or even causing sepsis. . The prize-winning test, however, reveals within 15 minutes whether the infection is bacterial - and within 45 minutes, which antibiotics work.. It starts with a urine sample, which is squirted into a cartridge containing tiny doses of five different antibiotics and placed inside a machine. . Any bacteria are forced - in single file - into one of thousands of channels inside the cartridge. . The machine then uses microscopy to monitor how any bacteria grow in the presence of the different drugs. . And the antibiotics that lead to little or no growth are the most likely to work.. A panel of 17 experts chose the winner from more than 250 entries.. Prof Johan Elf, from Uppsala University, said they had been working on measurement technology when the prize had been announced, a decade ago. . They then realised their work ""could be really useful in the fight against antimicrobial resistance"" and began working on the test. . Sysmex Astrego said it was rolling out the test in Europe and running studies in the UK.. ""The £8m prize will support us to tailor the test for use with different kinds of UTIs and antibiotics, speeding up access for more patients,” one of the company's founders, Mikael Olsson, said.. Dame Sally said the winner ""lays the groundwork for a sea-change in how we manage these precious medicines"" and rapid tests would mean patients received the ""right drug, first time”.. The technology is not currently recommended for use in the NHS, however.. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is still monitoring the difference it makes to patients and its cost-effectiveness.. Meanwhile, Prof Laura Piddock, from the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, said it would be a ”game-changer” only in rich countries that could afford it, while antimicrobial resistance was a global problem that was ""worse"" than when the prize had been announced. . In 1714, the UK government's Longitude Act offered £20,000 to whoever could solve the challenge of working out how far east or west ships at sea were.. This required knowing the time on board as well as back at home - each four-minute time difference means one degree of longitude.  . The ship's time could be set using the height of the Sun each day - but the ocean waves and the humidity would disrupt the delicate mechanisms in the clock trying to keep time back in port.  . Harrison, a self-taught clockmaker from Yorkshire, solved the problem but then battled the establishment for years to be deemed the winner. . The latest Longitude Prize was run by Challenge Works, a part of the innovation agency Nesta.. ""When there is a challenge of gargantuan proportions in desperate need of real-world solutions, prizes attract the brightest minds to solve the problem,"" Challenge Works managing director Tris Dyson said.. Another Longitude Prize, worth £4.4m, has now been announced - to help people in the earliest stages of dementia live independently.. Follow James on X, formerly known as Twitter.. .

bbc.com,Green Party manifesto: 11 key policies analysed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czddq40z2zno,2024-06-12 19:15:01,"The Green Party of England and Wales have launched their 2024 election manifesto. The document sets out what the party's plans would be, should it win the election on 4 July.. Here BBC correspondents have analysed the main pledges.. The cash injection being promised by the Greens into the NHS is huge. In the first year, they say they will increase the budget in England by £8bn. It is currently £165bn. And by 2030 there will be £28bn more. There will be more for public health too, delivered by councils.. To put that into context, the Liberal Democrats are only promising £8bn a year more for health by the end of the Parliament, while the Conservatives have limited their promises to above inflation increases.. The Green Party manifesto promises quicker access to NHS dentistry and GPs and reductions in the hospital waiting list. But the money will also be needed for one of its more unique proposals: a commitment to restore pay for junior doctors. That requires a 35% pay increase, something none of the other parties seem prepared to do.. Health is devolved so these policies would apply to England only.. The Green Party manifesto proposes to raise up to £151bn a year in new taxes by 2029. This would be a very large increase, equal to around 4.5% of GDP. . One of the big components of this is a new tax on the weathy, which they say would raise about £15bn. This would be levied at 1% a year on the assets of people with more than £10m and 2% on those with more than £1bn. . Some tax experts are doubtful this would raise as much as the Greens’ costings suggest, saying many wealthier people who are resident in the UK have only tenuous ties with the UK and could leave to avoid it. . However, Arun Advani of Warwick University, who was part of the Wealth Tax Commission, judges the idea of raising a sum from a wealth tax similar to that claimed by the Greens  to be “economically credible”.. This would apply to the whole of the UK. . The Green Party’s proposal on National Insurance is to charge the basic 8% rate on income above what’s called the Upper Earnings Limit. . If you pay higher-rate tax at 40% on some of your pay, you are in a small minority of the population who earn more than the higher-rate threshold of £50,270 a year. It is currently about 5.8 million people out of the total population of 67 million – less than a tenth.. It is a minority that’s expanding rapidly because of the 2021 decision to freeze income tax and National Insurance thresholds so that they do not rise in line with earnings or inflation. Since then, wages have risen rapidly but the thresholds haven’t, dragging more and more taxpayers above them to pay a higher rate of tax. Had those thresholds risen as before, there would now be only 3.9 million people exposed to the Green Party’s proposal – a little over a tenth of the workforce.. But instead there are now 5.8 million – about 15%. And that is set to grow to 6.7 million, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. The Greens say that if you earn £55,000, the additional amount you pay under their proposals would be less than £6 per week and if you earn £65,000, it would be about £17 a week.. This would apply to the whole of the UK. . The Greens are making a renewed pledge to scrap university tuition fees.. The party say they would “fully fund” every student and bring back maintenance grants. It is an expensive promise. It also comes at a time when universities are worried about their finances. Fees for UK students haven’t kept up with costs, and the number of higher-paying international students is predicted to fall.. The party says it would scrap “high-stakes testing” in schools and abolish their regulator, Ofsted. And there is a pledge to boost funding for schools by £8bn, including £2bn for teachers’ pay.. Spending per pupil currently sits, in real terms, at around the same level it did in 2010. With schools’ costs projected to rise by 4% in 2024 and teachers’ pay for September at the top of the next education secretary’s to-do list, head teachers will be keen to dig into the detail.. Education is devolved so these policies would only apply in England. The Green Party say they want to reach net zero – when the UK is adding no additional greenhouse gases to the atmosphere – by 2040 at the latest. That is, most analysts would agree, an extremely ambitious target.. By comparison, the Conservatives and Labour both aim to get to net zero by 2050.  The Lib Dems and SNP have set a 2045 target while the Reform Party says it will scrap the ambition completely.. But getting to net zero will be even more challenging for the Greens because unlike the other parties, they want to phase out nuclear power, currently about 15% of the UK’s electricity.. The Greens say they will achieve their goal thanks in large part to a huge rollout of renewable power. They propose a big expansion of offshore wind, as do the main parties. Where the Greens plan to go significantly further is with a massive growth in onshore wind and solar power. But that would likely generate strong local opposition. Many communities do not like to see solar panels covering farmland or wind turbines sprouting on hillsides.. This would apply to the whole of the UK. . The Green Party say they would invest £5bn in community sports, art and culture in England over five years, and remove VAT from cultural activities across the UK. But there is no detail on where that money would come from.. On media policy, the Greens want to tighten laws so that no individual or company owns more than 20% of a media market. This comes after a Saudi Arabian businessman bought a 30% stake in Independent Digital News and Media, the owners of the Independent, in 2017.. The party also wants to move forward with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards - that investigation to explore the relationship between journalists and the police has never happened. Neither the Conservatives nor Labour support proceeding, although the Liberal Democrats also put it in their manifesto. Campaigners who demand what they call a “free and accountable press” say it is vital.. The Greens have also proposed a Digital Bill of Rights that takes a cautionary approach to AI that would be in alignment with Europe and other international bodies.. The Greens call for sweeping reforms of Britain’s defence and foreign policies but the radicalism is often tempered by some more mainstream positions. The party would dismantle Britain’s entire Trident nuclear deterrent and remove all foreign nuclear weapons from UK soil. But the party would also keep the UK in the Nato military alliance, saying it has “an important role in ensuring the ability of its member states to respond to threats to their security”.. On the war in Gaza, the Greens would end UK military co-operation with Israel, reinstate funding for a UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and support international investigations into war crimes’ allegations against Israel. But it would also push for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and a long-term settlement to bring security to both sides.. The Greens would re-join the EU “as soon as the domestic political situation is favourable”. But it would seek to re-enter the Customs Union first and restore the free movement of people, especially students.. Naturally, much of their global focus is on climate change. The party would spend 1% of national income on foreign aid and 1.5% on climate finance. But like a rising number of countries in the West, its focus would be on giving emerging economies a greater say over how the money is spent.. This would apply to the whole of the UK.. The Green Party's plan of “investing to mend” includes an additional £20bn to tackle the crisis in adult social care. It is a big chunk of money, so inevitably there will be questions about whether the sums add up, and whether the country could afford that level of spending.. The Greens claim increasing taxes on the wealthiest and a carbon tax would raise up to £150bn a year to fund a range of promises. The party argue that putting more into early support for older and disabled people at home or in care homes would take pressure off the NHS.. Like the Lib Dems, they would make personal care free - so that is support with daily tasks like washing, dressing and medication. It would be similar to the system already operating in Scotland. The care system is struggling with increasing demand and staff shortages, so it is notable that these two smaller parties have made investing in social care an important part of their manifesto offers.. In contrast, the two main parties have had remarkably little to say on the subject so far.. Social care is devolved so these policies would apply to England only.. The Green Party says “we need to reduce how much we fly, and we need to do it fairly”. What this means in practice is a frequent flyer levy “to reduce the impact of the 15% of people who take 70% of the flights” and a stop to all airport expansion plans.. The party will also ban domestic flights for journeys that would take less than three hours by train and would also make airlines pay VAT on jet fuel - at the moment they do not pay any VAT on kerosene.. The Greens also plans an economy-wide carbon tax – a charge on any activities that produce carbon dioxide – that they say would also apply to airlines.. Some of these policies may sound a little familiar. The Lib Dem manifesto also contained a commitment to impose a levy on frequent fliers, to ban the shortest-haul flights and restrict airport expansion.. Two key elements of the Green Party’s housing policy seem to be lifted from the party’s experience of being in government in Scotland until April. Any MPs elected for the Greens will campaign for councils to be allowed to impose rent controls as well as banning no-fault evictions. In Scotland, the SNP/Green coalition introduced a 3% rent cap for private tenancies and a moratorium on evictions, with limited exceptions.  . Rent controls are popular with tenants but landlords argue they lead to fewer, poorer quality homes being available as owners can not afford to invest. The Conservatives also promised to ban no-fault evictions, but failed to get the legislation passed before Parliament was dissolved.. The Greens also promised to campaign to build 150,000 social homes a year in England and end Right to Buy. Building that number of social homes has not been achieved for decades; between 2019 and 2023 for instance, just 30,000 homes for social rent were built across England.. Housing is devolved so these policies would only apply in England.. The Greens say they will nationalise the companies that run our railways, our water companies and the big five energy companies. That has long been their policy, but sounds a lot less outspoken now than it might have done a few years ago.. Following Margaret Thatcher’s privatisations of British Steel, British Petroleum and British Airways, John Major’s government of 1990-1997 continued with the coal industry, energy industry and British Rail. Accepting the view that privatisation meant efficiency, Labour PMs Tony Blair and Gordon Brown embraced similar principles with the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), under which the government had contracts with the private sector finance to build and maintain hospitals, prisons and roads. The 2010-2015 Tory-Lib Dem coalition government continued to privatise.. Since then, some poorly run private companies have been propped up with public money to stop them going bust, from Railtrack, the company that owned the railway lines, to LNER and Southeastern train operators more recently. In 2022/23 the government spent about £67bn subsidising energy companies to charge lower bills, something they could not have done without the government. . Water companies have been criticised for extracting big dividends while failing to invest, resulting in sewage leaks. And PFI, condemned by MPs as providing poor value for money for the taxpayer, was ditched by Theresa May’s government in 2018.. First time voters in Felixstowe share their key issues as the general election campaign gathers pace..

bbc.com,Are young people forced out of Wales to find work?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl44md3zj81o,2024-06-13 05:08:28,"Conor Fagan is living the dream.. While many of his friends chose to work in trades, he wanted something else and, at the age of 23, owns his own watersport business on a beach on Anglesey.. If he had not chosen his own path, how easy would it be for him to find work nearby, in the current economic climate?. He believes there are career options in the area, but ""obviously there's less opportunity for people that want to earn more money in the area here"".. Conor believes living on Anglesey means people have to ""apply themselves a little bit more,"" in order to find higher-paid work, much more than those in larger towns and cities.. He added: ""I'm very fortunate in that I have my own business here, so I can afford to live here. . ""But a lot of my friends and peers, maybe not so much, and they do have to move away to find a better career path to be able to sustain living here."" . Edward Altoft, 18, is one of Conor's part-time watersports instructors at Funsport in Rhosneigr.. But later this year the first-time voter will leave sixth form and study engineering at university in England.. Asked if he would like to return to work on Anglesey, he said: ""100% yeah. I'd want to stay here the rest of my life if I could. It's perfect for me, I love it.. ""But if there's not the job for me here - which I don't really think there is at the moment for engineering - then I'll have to move inwards and come here on holiday."". He said work for people interested in trade and hospitality was good on the island, but with colleges ""pushing you to go into jobs such as finance, engineering, things like that"", it was ""super difficult round here to find jobs like that"".. Fellow sixth-former Osian Buckland, 18, works part-time at Funsport.. He is about to leave sixth form to study sports science at university, and said people in the area would ""struggle to get further up"" than hospitality or labour.. ""I'd like to stay here forever but there isn't the right jobs. It'd be much easier for a lot of people to move into a city and get a job there.. ""My aim's definitely to come back here and hopefully I can find something for me."". Graduate Nadine Moore, 28, is Funsport's manager and loves her job but has friends from the area who have moved across the border to find work in England.. She said she would worry too if she was forced to look for work: ""I do think to stay in the area I'd potentially struggle to go down a career path that I'd really want to do.. ""I think for myself I would either look at moving a little bit more inland and towards a city."". Just up the road from Funsport, Becky Bevan, 27, who owns Cafe Notos in Rhosneigr, said she would not want to be job hunting now.. ""I think it would be difficult, and I say that from a place where I've been there. Just after Covid, I was like 'what am I going to do?'. ""I've got a degree, I moved back here - exactly in the position that lots of people are in in their 20s....what am I going to do for work?. Becky believes the desire for well-paid work means ""a lot of young people are moving away, and I don't know if necessarily a lot of them are coming back either,"" because of high house prices.. We can see there has been steady trend of net migration out of Anglesey for young people aged 15 to 29.. Ynys Mon also has the third lowest proportion of this age group of all Welsh parliamentary constituencies.. Young or talented people leaving for better pay - or brain drain - is not unique to the island - Wales has a pattern of net migration of 15 to 29-year-olds leaving for other parts of the UK.. Health and social care is the sector employing the most people in Wales, followed by retail.. There is a similar picture at a local level on Anglesey, which has proportionately more people than average working in the hospitality, construction and farming industries.. There are fewer opportunities in manufacturing, however.. Anglesey has one of the highest employment rates in Wales, which saw more than 77% in a job, for the working age population, at the end of last year.. Huw Brassington, from Llandwrog, Gwynedd, is a senior mechanical engineer who himself relocated from Wales to Cumbria in order find a suitable job.. He now works with Tenet Consultants, which provides engineering designs for large-scale projects including nuclear and renewables.. The company recently opened an office on Anglesey, which he heads, and he says the company is focused on providing well-paid jobs and encouraging skilled workers back to Wales.. The former lecturer said: ""I understand the challenges faced by young engineers in north Wales first-hand. . ""I witnessed many eager and talented students with limited opportunities. Despite their potential, only a handful secured apprenticeships. . ""I have remained in contact with many of my former students and am now striving to recruit them.. ""Many excel in their careers but often face long commutes or permanent relocation. One of my best former students, for example, commutes from Bala to Bristol weekly."". Stopping brain-drain, he said, ""requires a long-term strategy"" to ""start cultivating our engineers of the future"".. On the economy and employment, the Welsh Liberal Democrats said they would ""offer something different from the current status quo and that is a fair deal that will deliver a strong economy through investment, fair taxes, and responsible management of the public finances"".. The Welsh Conservatives said a strong economy ""delivers strong public services"", but added ""Labour has no plan to grow Wales’ economy, to get people into work, to boost wages for Welsh workers or to support Welsh businesses"".. Labour said: ""The Welsh Labour government is focused on protecting Welsh jobs,  getting people out of poverty and addressing the Tory-made cost of living crisis,"" but said it had been ""compromised by a Conservative government"" in Westminster.. Plaid Cymru and Reform have been asked to comment. . First time voters in Felixstowe share their key issues as the general election campaign gathers pace..

bbc.com,How could global turmoil affect the election in Scotland?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clddgxgg12vo,2024-06-13 05:06:40,"It's nearly five years since the United Kingdom last went to the polls in a general election and a lot has happened in that time.. Three events in particular will have their own lengthy entries in the history books.. The global pandemic, the UK's departure from the European Union, and the war in Ukraine have had deep and lasting effects on life and politics in Scotland and further afield.. What impact might they have on the outcome of this election?. Scotland's first coronavirus death was confirmed in March 2020. Just 10 months later the UK registered more than 1,500 deaths with Covid-19 in a single day.. Politicians responded to this unprecedented public health emergency by introducing the most extreme restrictions on our liberty ever known in peacetime.. Whatever the rights and wrongs of lockdowns - which were supported by all four big UK parties - the publicly-funded National Health Service is still feeling the effects of that period.. As much routine healthcare was suspended to prioritise tackling the virus, the number of people waiting for treatment, and the length of time they were waiting, soared.. With their treatment delayed, many patients became sicker, with some developing additional conditions.. That piled further pressure on the NHS, which is actually four separate systems, currently administered by the Conservatives in England; the Scottish National Party in Scotland; Labour in Wales; and the power-sharing government of Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in Northern Ireland. . For all four governments, the pandemic highlighted existing problems.. ""Critical underlying issues were brutally exposed with too few staff, too few beds, and buildings that were unsuitable for effective infection control,"" according to doctors' trade union, the British Medical Association (BMA).. In Scotland, a recent official audit pointed out that waiting times standards were often missed before the pandemic, adding that soaring costs, long waits, and staff shortages were now having ""a direct impact on patient safety"".. The Audit Scotland report concluded that the NHS and its workforce were ""unable to meet the growing demand for health services,"" and accused the Scottish government of having ""no overall vision"" for the future delivery of healthcare.. The Scottish government has defended its Covid recovery plan and the new Scottish health secretary, Neil Gray, insists he will take a ""pragmatic"" approach to repairing the 76-year-old institution. . Because of devolution, the outcome of this election will not directly determine policy on health, education or other devolved areas such as housing or transport.. However, that does not mean such issues are irrelevant in this campaign.. Although the Scottish government decides how to allocate its resources (a limited amount of which it raises itself through taxation) the level of most of its budget, known as the block grant, is determined by Westminster.. If the UK government cuts spending on, say, criminal justice in England, then Scotland's overall budget will fall by a related amount.. Perhaps voters will take that into account when they go to the polls on 4 July, or maybe they will use the occasion to pass judgment on any number of Covid-related matters, from public sector procurement scandals to rows about deleted messages to parties during lockdown.. Some may want to make a much wider point about the overall system within which the NHS is run, whether that is to support Scotland's 317-year-old union with England, or to signal a desire for Scotland to become independent.. In other words, it’s pointless for any commentator to proclaim that the election is about this but not about that. What it is about is a matter for each voter.. The second big change since the last general election happened an hour before midnight on 31 January 2020.. That was the moment the UK formally left the European Union, 47 years after joining its predecessor trading bloc, the European Economic Community (EEC).. In a 2016 referendum on membership, Scotland and Northern Ireland voted by wide margins to remain in the EU while more populous England, along with Wales, voted narrowly to leave, setting the entire UK on a course for exit.. The Office for Budget Responsibility, a UK government body which provides independent economic analysis and forecasts, estimates that the UK's departure will, in the long run, cut both imports and exports by 15% and reduce productivity (output per worker) by 4%.. The Scottish government says that ""equates to £3bn in lost public revenues for Scotland, each and every year."". The Conservative UK government says Brexit frees up the country to strike its own trade deals, take back control of its laws, and set its own immigration limits.. Both the Conservatives and Labour say they have no intention of revisiting the result of the referendum. . In their manifesto, the Liberal Democrats vow to “fix the UK’s broken relationship with Europe”. That includes a pledge to seek to rejoin the Single Market, with a “longer-term objective” of rejoining the EU.. The SNP say Scotland should rejoin the EU as an independent nation, a proposal which is itself the subject of intense debate.. For now, the topic of immigration is another clear dividing line between, on the one hand the SNP and the Liberal Democrats, who both favour a more liberal approach, and, on the other, Labour and the Tories, who are more restrictive,. On Friday's BBC election debate, the SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn argued that migration was essential for Scottish public services, businesses, and economic growth.. Mr Flynn pointed to last month's release of census data which revealed that ""without migration, Scotland’s population would have decreased,"" with fewer workers to support an ageing population.. Critics of the current level of immigration into the UK as too high say it has put intolerable strain on public services such as housing, schools and healthcare.. The Conservatives say they will cut immigration, which has risen sharply since the last election, and will press ahead with attempts to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, to try to deter people from making the dangerous crossing of the English Channel in small boats.. Labour says it will reduce the need for immigration by improving the training of British workers.. Russian president Vladimir Putin's decision to order an invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sent shockwaves through a global economy which was already struggling to cope with a surge in demand for imported products as lockdowns were lifted and trading resumed.. As Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia, oil and gas prices soared, and supplies of wheat, sunflower oil and other products from the region were disrupted.. The global effect was to turbo charge inflation, pushing up the price of energy, food and mortgages, and leading to ""a widespread fall in household incomes.”. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says 12 million people in the UK are now living in absolute poverty and this parliament ""is on course to be the worst on record for growth in average incomes."". At a global level the economic impact was a ""catastrophe"" for some of the poorest citizens on earth, according to the World Bank.. But even before all three world-shaking events — the war, the pandemic, and Brexit — there were serious concerns about the underlying state of the UK economy.. Productivity had slumped following both the financial crisis of 2007/8 and the cuts to public spending, known as austerity, which were Tory chancellor George Osborne's response to it.. The brief tenure of prime minister Liz Truss also contributed to the economic turmoil.. Together, all of these shifts in the political and economic landscape over the past five years or so pose many challenges for the big parties at this election.. The SNP say we are now living in ""broken Brexit Britain,"" with a disastrous combination of entrenched low growth, low productivity and high inequality, from which independence can provide an escape route.. But if leaving the EU was so damaging, why would leaving the UK not be disruptive too, leading to public spending cuts, tax rises, or both, at least in the first decade of a fledging Scottish state?. In any case the power to allow a second referendum on independence lies with Westminster, where both Labour and the Tories continue to insist they will block another vote.. The Conservatives say Rishi Sunak has guided the nation through tough times with a clear plan, and the economy is now improving.. But with annual growth still weak in historical terms, government debt still high, and living standards under severe pressure, is that credible?. Labour are promising ""change"" which they say means Sir Keir Starmer would stabilise the economy by sticking to Tory spending constraints while keeping “taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible."". But could Sir Keir actually deliver meaningful change, given the state of the economy and his self-imposed constraints, which include, to the frustration of Scottish Labour, retaining some Tory curbs on welfare benefits?. The Liberal Democrats say they want to see a new industrial strategy and to repair the UK's ""broken relationship with Europe."". But even if there were the appetite in the UK at large, and among MPs in particular, to restructure the Brexit deal, why would Brussels agree to do so?. Politicians of all stripes are scrambling for answers and struggling to adapt to the dramatic changes the world has witnessed since the last general election.. First time voters in Felixstowe share their key issues as the general election campaign gathers pace..

bbc.com,Starmer faces questions on tax and trust as Sunak grilled on D-Day and immigration,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0xx5le1qwxo,2024-06-12 21:54:31,"Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer have faced tough questions from an audience in Grimsby Town Hall, as part of a TV election programme on Sky News. . Keir Starmer defended backing Jeremy Corbyn in the 2019 general election by saying he knew Labour was going to lose.. And when pressed on his plan to remove VAT tax breaks from private schools, the Labour leader said he wanted to tackle a lack of resources in state schools. . Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he appreciated people's frustrations with the government as he acknowledge that levels of tax and immigration were ""too high"". . He also apologised again for leaving the D-Day commemorations early and for Covid rule-breaking in government.. Responding to a disgruntled former Conservative activist who said she felt ""ashamed"" of the government, Mr Sunak said he was trying to rebuild trust through his actions and by ""making progress on the things that matter to people"" such as economic stability.. Asked for a fact about himself that might make people ""like him more"", he said he had an ""appalling diet"" which included Haribo sweets and Twixes.. The prime minister faced more hostile heckling from the audience, particularly when talking about the NHS waiting lists.. Sir Keir also faced tricky moments, particularly when one audience member complained he did not answer questions and compared the Labour leader to a ""political robot"".. After a brief pause and audience laughter, Sir Keir talked about his former roles working with the police in Northern Ireland and in the Crown Prosecution Service saying there's been a ""constant theme in my life of trying to serve the public"".. He was repeatedly asked why he backed Jeremy Corbyn in the general election 2019 but was now disparaging the former leader. . Sir Keir said he was ""certain that we would lose the 2019 election"" and that he campaigned for Labour because he wanted ""good colleagues"" to keep their seats in Parliament. . Asked why he had shifted positions on subjects since taking over from Mr Corbyn as leader, Sir Keir said: ""When you lose that badly you don’t look to the voters and say 'what on earth do you think you were doing', you look at your party and say 'we have to change'."". One audience member told Sir Keir he feared being priced out of private schools due to Labour's plans to remove VAT tax breaks. . The Labour leader said he had nothing against private schools and recognised that parents ""work hard and save hard"" to send their children there. . However, he added that ""every parent has aspiration for their children whether they go to private school or not"".. He said money raised through his private school policy would help recruit 6,500 teachers for state secondary schools.. Asked what he feared the most about potentially becoming prime minister, the Labour leader spoke of his concern about how becoming prime minister could affect his teenage children.. He said it was ""the only thing that keeps me up at night"". . Both leaders were grilled for twenty minutes by Sky News presenter Beth Rigby, and then a further twenty minutes from the audience.. Asked about past promises from Conservative leaders that net migration would come down, Mr Sunak said he understood ""people’s cynicism” but insisted he had taken action to reduce it.. He pointed to a clampdown on abuse of social care visas and an increase of the salaries needed in order to get work visas, and said the numbers were now “heading in the right direction”.. On the economy, the prime minister said he knew things were “not easy” but that he had been taking action to make things “that little bit easier” by trying to bring down inflation.. One audience member accused Mr Sunak of moving his party “away from young people” citing the prime minister’s proposal to introduce national service.. Mr Sunak said national service would be ""transformation"" for young people, adding that he was ""incredibly excited"" for his daughters to do the scheme.. First time voters in Felixstowe share their key issues as the general election campaign gathers pace..

This means the central bank is now anticipating just one 25 basis point rate cut this year versus 75 previously. The 2025 year-end fed funds expectation is now 4.1%, suggesting 100 basis points in rate cuts next year.At his post-meeting press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said inflation remains too high and the central bank's focus remains on returning that gauge to its 2% target.Earlier today, the U.S. Consumer Price Index report for May showed an unexpected slowdown in inflation last month.

Year-over-year, core CPI rose 3.4% against expectations for 3.5% and April's 3.6%..Bitcoin (BTC) welcomed the soft inflation read, jumping to $69,400, up nearly 4% over the past 24 hours.After inflation readings rapidly fell in 2022 and 2023 as the Federal Reserve jacked up interest rates, the trend stalled in the previous months at stubbornly higher levels than policymakers' 2% target, pouring cold water on market participants' expectations of rate cuts.Early this year, traders anticipated five or six 25 basis points (bps) cuts in 2024 by the end of December, which shrunk to one or two before today's CPI report with the first cut not happening until September, the CME FedWatch Tool showed.Crypto prices have been ""highly sensitive"" to U.S. economic data recently, K33 Research noted in a report earlier this week. The recent hotter inflation figures and resulting diminished hopes for rate cuts propelled bitcoin's tumble from all-time high prices above $73,000 in March to below $57,000 in May. Traders anticipate that looser monetary conditions will fuel the crypto rally's next leg to record prices.Contrasting the U.S. expectations, several key central banks globally have already started to lower benchmark rates with the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada cutting rates last week, which helped to propel the U.S. dollar index (DXY) to a one-month high.Investors will also watch closely the Fed's ""dot plot"" to be released later today of the Federal Market Open Committee members' interest rate projection, which could move asset prices.Edited by Kevin Reynolds and Stephen Alpher."
