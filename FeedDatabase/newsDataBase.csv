bbc.com,Julian Assange pleads guilty in US court in deal to end legal battle over leaks,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-69145409,2024-06-25 01:06:11,". With updates from Jonathan Head in Saipan and Tiffanie Turnbull and Hannah Ritchie in Sydney. And we'll keep you signed in.. Sign in  or  Register. You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law..   Edited by Yvette Tan. All times stated are UK. As we mentioned earlier, Wikileaks says that Assange will next travel to Canberra, the capital of Australia.. His private travel from the UK to Australia via Bangkok and the Northern Mariana Islands - was paid for by the Australian government, with the campaign due to repay the costs.. The journey comes with a $520,000 (£410,000) price tag, and WikiLeaks has launched a crowdfunding appeal, calling on Assange’s supporters to chip in. . “His travel to freedom comes at a massive cost,” the plea, posted on X on Tuesday, read. . The appeal is seeking to raise £520,000 in total, and has already taken in over £252,000 in donations since it launched. . Assange’s wife Stells has previously said Assange was “not permitted to fly commercial airlines or routes to Saipan and onward to Australia"".. After all that detail was hashed out, Assange has just reaffirmed his guilty plea.. The judge accepts the plea, but says the court will take a 20 minute break before she hands down his sentence.. We'll have those developments for you shortly, stay with us.. Jonathan Head. Reporting from the courthouse. The prosecutor has now finished outlining his case. . He says the government doesn’t dispute Assange’s belief that his actions should have been covered by the First Amendment - which protects free speech - but the facts stand.. Assange doesn't dispute the prosecutor’s account, and the judge now confirms the prosecution intends to dismiss other charges against Assange. . The prosecutor has now turned to describing the actions of Chelsea Manning, who leaked documents to Assange.. She used US government computers to download thousands of documents including 90,000 Afghanistan military activity reports and 400,000 from Iraq, and then sent them to the Wikileaks founder.. Referring to messages between Manning and Assange, the prosecutor again emphasised Assange knew the documents were top secret.. They also said many of the leaked papers were not redacted enough to protect individuals exposed by them.. Jonathan Head. Reporting from the courthouse. Judge Ramona Manglona is now running through the specific details of the ""conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information"" charge - which is the felony Assange will plead guilty to under the terms of his deal.. Assange is telling the courtroom that when he published the classified documents that had been leaked to him in 2010, he was working as a journalist and believed he would be protected by the first amendment. . He also said he believes the Espionage Act - which he is being charged under - conflicts with the first amendment. . The prosecutor is now outlining the government's case again, and calling on Assange to listen carefully so that he can challenge any details he thinks are wrong. . They're going through how the WikiLeaks founder actively enouraged leaks of classified information - saying he told leakers that  ""top secret means nothing"".. Jonathan Head. Reporting from the courthouse. The prosecutor in Assange's case is now talking about Chelsea Manning - the former US Army Intelligence analyst who supplied WikiLeaks with the confidential documents they would go on to publish in 2010. . They’re reminding the court that she was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2013, before her sentence was commuted to 7 years by President Obama. . Turning back to Assange, the prosecutor is making it clear that if the WikiLeaks founder takes this deal his presumption of innocence comes to an end, and that he will waive his right to an appeal.. The US has almost 100 district courts - but this is the country's smallest, its youngest and the furthest from the capital, Washington DC.. The US territory in the western Pacific was chosen due to Assange's opposition to traveling to the mainland US and for its proximity to his native Australia, prosecutors have said. . Jonathan Head. Reporting from the courthouse. We’re inside the courthouse now, watching Assange’s sentencing via a live feed in an overflow room because the court is so full.. So far, Judge Ramona Manglona - who is presiding over Assange's appearance - has run through the charges he’s facing and asked him if he understands all the details.. She’s also making sure he understands the terms of this plea agreement, and whether anyone threatened or persuaded him to accept it.. Lastly, she has reminded him that he has the right not to accept the terms of this deal and that he can still withdraw his guilty plea. Pleading guilty means he will have to face consequences like being unable to enter the US.. We'll bring you more when we have it.. According to WikiLeaks, Assange will be landing in Australia's capital, Canberra, once his hearing wraps up in the Northern Mariana Islands. . ""Expected to depart in 2 hours, 58 minutes. To Canberra, Australia.

Flight VJT199,"" the organisation wrote in a post on X a short time ago, sharing a tracker of the flight. . According to the tracker, he's due to land at around 18:41 Australian Eastern Standard Time (08:41 GMT) on Wednesday. . Julian Assange has officially pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defence documents in court. . His sentence is due to be announced shortly.. Tiffanie Turnbull. BBC News, Sydney. The presence of two men at court with Assange in the Northern Mariana Islands hints at the massive diplomatic effort to get the Wikileaks founder there.. Front and centre was Kevin Rudd, a former Australian prime minister - and at one point its foreign minister - who is now the country's ambassador to the US.. Australian political scientists say foreign affairs and diplomacy were always Rudd's strength as a politician - something he likely put to work in securing Assange's release. . Someone else thought to have been key to arranging a plea deal between Assange and the US government is Australia's High Commissioner to the UK, Stephen Smith - who oddly enough was Rudd's foreign minister between 2007 and 2010.. We still know fairly little about the negotiations around the deal, but diplomatic sources said Smith ""did a lot of the heavy lifting, making it a personal thing to get this over the line"".. Simon Jackman - an honorary Professor of US Studies at the University of Sydney - told the BBC that Smith is ""intimately familiar with all the details"" and ""exceptionally well equipped
to handle an issue of this of sensitivity among alliance partners"".. Read more about how the deal was done here.. Assange's court hearing is reported to be under way, according to the Reuters news agency. . He is expected to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defence information as part of a US plea bargain.. In return, he will be allowed to walk free and return to his native Australia. . Stay with us as we bring you all the latest updates. . Nomia Iqbal. BBC News, Washington. The deal between the US government and Assange was agreed just last week - on Wednesday 19 June.. We are yet to find out exactly why the US took this rather dramatic reversal in policy.. Three years ago, the US justice department said it would pursue extradition, although President Joe Biden did indicate in April he was considering Australia’s request to resolve the legal limbo.. We are, of course, in a presidential election year and it’s hard not to see everything through that lens.. Biden's opponent Donald Trump said last month he would consider pardoning Assange if he won November’s election.. The decision is dividing lawmakers here in both Democratic and Republican parties. There are those who consider Assange a menace who endangered soldiers’ lives. Others see him as a free speech hero who simply exposed US war secrets to the public.. We're still waiting for the Wikileaks founder to appear in court in Saipan - the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands - to formalise his plea deal with the US. . Here he is walking into court about an hour ago. . Assange's wife Stella has given us some insight into how he is coping with being out in the world after years spent in London's high-security Belmarsh prison. . ""I watch this and think how overloaded his senses must be walking through the press scrum,"" she writes on X, referring to footage showing Assange arriving at court in Saipan to formalise his plea deal with the US. . Just months ago, Stella Assange told the BBC her husband was extremely weak mentally and physically and that she did not think he could survive being extradited from the UK to the US. . James Landale. Diplomatic correspondent. To his supporters, Assange is a valiant campaigner for truth. To his critics, he is a publicity seeker who has endangered lives by putting a mass of sensitive information into the public domain.. Assange is described by those who have worked with him as intense, driven and highly intelligent, with an exceptional ability to crack computer codes.. He set up Wikileaks, which publishes confidential documents and images, in 2006, making headlines around the world in April 2010 when it released footage showing US soldiers shooting dead 18 civilians from a helicopter in Iraq.. But later that year the Australian was detained in the UK - and later bailed - after Sweden issued an international arrest warrant over allegations of sexual assault..  Assange argued it was a ploy to ultimately extradite to the US to face espionage charges - kicking off a legal saga which has now spanned 14 years, embroiled five countries and reached some of the world's highest courts.. Read more about this here. . We've just seen footage of the Wikileaks founder walking through the doors of the court in Saipan where he is expected to formalise his plea deal with the US shortly.. Assange was seen getting out of a car, accompanied by Australia’s ambassador to the US and former prime minister Kevin Rudd.. He then walked into the building and was filmed going through security scanners. . Shaimaa Khalil. Asia Correspondent. The scene outside the US district
courthouse here in Saipan is serene and surreal. This tall, modern-looking
building with its grey pillars and glass facade overlooks a pristine beach and
is surrounded by lush greenery. It’s impossibly hot and humid here and it's unclear how long Assange will spend on this picturesque island, chosen
specifically because it’s not mainland USA where Assange refused to travel
because he had no confidence or trust in the US authorities.. So it's in this
picturesque US Pacific territory that the final chapter of this legal saga
will play out. He'll plead guilty to a single felony: illegally
obtaining and disclosing national security material. . Saipan is also closer to his home country Australia where he will travel after the hearing.  . The case has spanned almost a decade and a half and involved five
countries and relentless advocacy and diplomacy. It
polarised opinions and raised questions about freedom of speech especially when
it came to national security reporting but
here in Saipan, for the first time in a very long
time, Julian Assange gets to go home a free man.. As we've been reporting, Assange is expected in court in Saipan - the capital of the Northern Nariana Islands - in the coming hours. . According to court filings, the island was chosen by Assange because of his unwillingness to travel to the US mainland. . After he pleads guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defence information, Assange is expected to be sentenced to time served and told he is free to go. . He is then expected to fly to his native Australia, where his family is waiting. . What happens after that remains to be seen but a lawyer for Assange, Greg Barns, told the BBC it was ""pretty clear that Julian can now start to move on with his life”.. According to the Reuters news agency, Assange was seen leaving Saipan airport in a motorcade a short time ago.. He is due to appear in court on the island to plead guilty to one charge of violating the Espionage Act in the coming hours. . "
bbc.com,Cabinet minister admits three election date bets,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czkk0d19kgdo,2024-06-25 23:07:43,"A Conservative cabinet minister has admitted placing three bets on the date of the general election in the weeks before Rishi Sunak’s surprise announcement.. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told the BBC that in April he placed a successful bet that the election date would fall between July and September - after losing two similar bets in March.. Mr Jack who is standing down at the election after seven years in Parliament, says he has not breached any rules.. He had originally told the BBC he had made £2,100 from one of the bets - but later claimed his comments were ""a joke... I was pulling your leg"".. On Tuesday, Mr Jack admitted he had placed a £20 bet at five to one - which would have netted him a return of £120.. He said he had also ""put two bets on in March of £5 each for an election to be held in May and June respectively"".. The prime minister made his surprise election announcement on 22 May. . Mr Jack said in a statement: ""I had no knowledge of the date of the election until the day it was called.. ""I placed no bets in May and am not under investigation by the Gambling Commission."". A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: “We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.”. Alister Jack had been telling colleagues and journalists for at least a year that he thought a June or July election made the most strategic sense for his party.. He has represented Scotland in the UK cabinet since 2019, under the premierships of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.. His controversial decision in 2021 to block the Scottish government’s gender self-ID reforms was seen as a significant moment in the demise of Nicola Sturgeon’s period as Scotland’s First Minister.. In February 2024, he expressed “regret” after deleting all of his WhatsApp messages from during the pandemic. . He said he erased his files to free up storage capacity on his phone in November 2021..

bbc.com,Fifth Tory politician in election betting probe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clkkyx9rxzzo,2024-06-25 22:06:56,"A Conservative politician in the Welsh Parliament is being investigated over a bet on the timing of the general election.. Russell George is the fifth Conservative to face inquiries by the Gambling Commission.. It comes on the same day the Conservatives withdrew their support for two general election candidates, including Mr George's colleague Craig Williams, who is standing in the newly-named constituency of Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr.. Mr George, whose seat is Montgomeryshire, said he will co-operate fully with the commission, and has ""stepped back"" from the Senedd's Conservative frontbench.. Meanwhile, a former Labour parliamentary candidate was suspended by his party after he said he made a ""stupid error"" in betting he would lose his bid to become an MP.. Labour and Plaid Cymru called for Mr George to be suspended from the Conservative Senedd group.. He is the second Welsh Conservative to leave the Welsh Tory frontbench in the last month, after Laura Anne Jones was stripped of her spokesperson role in an expenses row.. Mr Williams, who had been a parliamentary aide to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, was the first Tory to admit he had placed a bet on the timing of the election.. The BBC's political editor Chris Mason reported that Mr George’s bet, placed online for a July election, was placed more than a week before the election was called and neither man was aware of the other’s bet.. It is not known how much Mr George bet or what the odds were.. Earlier on Tuesday Mr George had called on voters to back his colleague Mr Williams despite the decision by the Conservatives to withdraw the party's support.. He said at the time: ""It may seem old fashioned, but I believe in innocent until proven guilty."". Mr George's constituency was also represented by Mr Williams in Westminster before the dissolution of the UK parliament.. He had been the party's spokesman for mid Wales on the Conservative frontbench.. In a statement issued after The Guardian broke the story, Mr George said: ""Whilst I will cooperate fully with the Gambling Commission, it would not be appropriate to comment on this independent and confidential process.. ""Doing so would only jeopardise and undermine the investigation. It is the Gambling Commission, not the media, that has the responsibility, powers and resources to properly investigate these matters and determine what, if any, action should be taken.. ""I have stepped back from the shadow cabinet while the investigation is ongoing. I have done this as I do not wish to be an unnecessary distraction to their work."". Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd, said Mr George had informed him he had ""received a letter from the Gambling Commission regarding bets on the timing of the general election"".. Mr Davies added: “All other members of the Welsh Conservative [Senedd] group have confirmed that they have not placed any bets."". Welsh Labour campaign chair Jessica Morden said: ""It took Rishi Sunak almost two weeks to take action on one of his Conservative candidates.. ""How long will it take Andrew RT Davies to suspend Russell George?"". Plaid's Mabon ap Gwynfor said: “You couldn't make this up. Hours after backing dropped candidate Craig Williams after another betting scandal, Russell George is found to have done the exact same thing.. “He should have the whip withdrawn from the Welsh Conservative Senedd group at once."". Earlier on Tuesday the Conservatives confirmed they had withdrawn support for Mr Williams and Laura Saunders, the candidate for Bristol North West.. Both will appear on ballot papers, but could become independent if elected, pending the result of an investigation.. Two members of Conservative staff have also taken leaves of absence from their roles after it emerged they were being looked into by the Gambling Commission.. In a video statement posted to X, Mr Williams said he remained committed to the election.. He said he had ""committed an error of judgment, not an offence"" adding: ""I want to reiterate my apology directly to you."". ""I am fully co-operating with routine inquiries from the Gambling Commission and I intend to clear my name,"" he said.. Last week, a spokesperson for Ms Saunders said she would be co-operating with the Gambling Commission and had nothing further to add..

bbc.com,'Unusual environment' - booed Southgate on cups thrown at him,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cw00y6x3j07o,2024-06-25 22:26:55,"This video can not be played. 'Unusual environment' around England - Southgate. Some England fans' reactions to the team's performances at Euro 2024 are ""creating an unusual environment"", says manager Gareth Southgate.. His side finished top of Group C on Tuesday after a goalless draw against Slovenia followed a 1-1 stalemate with Denmark in their previous group-stage game.. Southgate's side were booed off, and some empty cups were thrown at the Three Lions boss following another below-par display.. ""I'm not going to back away from it,"" he said. ""The most important thing is the supporters stay with the team."". England had an early Bukayo Saka goal disallowed for offside, but did little else to trouble Slovenia goalkeeper Jan Oblak.. Southgate said he ""understands"" why fans have expressed their displeasure at disappointing performances and results, which included a 1-0 success over Serbia in their opening match of the tournament.. Fans jeered England as they entered half-time having failed to break the deadlock. Southgate was met by another negative response as he went to applaud supporters at full-time, with cups thrown in his direction.. ""I understand the narrative towards me and that's better for the team than it being towards them,"" he added. . ""But it is creating an unusual environment to operate in. I've not seen any other team qualify and receive similar. I understand it, I'm not going to back away from it, but I'm very proud of the players for how they're operating within it."". Draw opens up - England's path through the knockouts. 'Ill feeling and mediocrity but rays of hope from elsewhere'. 'England can't afford to mismanage massive talents'. Southgate also revealed the responses from some supporters are ""causing an issue for the group"" and urged them to back the players.. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I was not going to back away from going over to thank people for coming and giving the support that they did, but I know that this is causing an issue for the group.. ""I can deal with that but I need them to support the players."". Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford conceded England have ""not played our best"" and coming under fire is understandable.. ""No game is easy and we are going to come under criticism - we have to deal with that. We have finished top of the group and we have not played our best,"" he added.. ""We have got to keep a positive mindset and bring the positives. We know we weren't perfect, but we didn't get beat in three games."". This video can not be played. Highlights: England 0-0 Slovenia. England have managed to find a path out of their group, but they have struggled to find their best form at Euro 2024.. Their 2.26 expected goals from the three games ranked 19th among the 24 teams at the competition and they have only mustered the 17th most shots.. The Three Lions misfired again in Cologne against Slovenia, yet a defiant Southgate insisted ""things are starting to come together"" for his side.. ""We have created some good openings and, at the moment, it is hard work for us,"" he told ITV Sport.. ""We are not quite getting that break in front of goal. I think the players who came on did well. I understand the reactions but it is a tough environment."". Defender John Stones echoed those sentiments as he added: ""I thought there was a lot of improvement from the other two games. We found people in the pockets and created more chances - another step in the right direction.. ""I can get the fans' frustration, not taking chances, but that is football. It is never an easy game."". UEFA Euro 2024. Euro 2024 fixtures and scores. Euro 2024 groups. Comments can not be loaded. To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

bbc.com,"This city is worried about immigration, but who has the solution?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw00yg9z0dgo,2024-06-25 17:05:33,"Mike and Graham have been collecting bins for four decades between them. Their patch includes Peterborough’s Lincoln Road, where Lithuanian restaurants vie for space with job agencies advertising new positions in Polish.. “It seems like every nationality lives here,” says Graham. “I don’t see much integration, they keep themselves to themselves.”. “They don’t respect our country,” he says.. Over a quarter of Peterborough’s population is foreign-born, well above the almost 17% average for England and Wales. A sense of disquiet over the change that can accompany immigration is hardly new, but it is what Graham says next that is perhaps more revealing. I ask if he’d stop further immigration.. “You can’t stop it,” says Graham. “You’d have an empty hospital.” If Graham is struggling to live with immigration, he’s also of the view that the country currently depends on it.. The BBC’s Your Vote, Your Voice project has heard from thousands of you about concerns over immigration. We spent several days in Peterborough talking to people about it, and again and again I heard concerns about social cohesion and pressure on public services caused by immigration - and not just from those who were born in the UK.. Net migration to the UK rose significantly after Brexit, peaking at 764,000 in 2022, and was an estimated 685,000 in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics. An Ipsos survey of 3,000 people in February found 52% of people wanted immigration to be reduced.. Migration has been a high-profile issue in the campaign and there have been bad-tempered clashes between politicians offering very different visions of an issue that regularly tracks as one of the most important for voters. . On the outskirts of Peterborough we visited the Ortons Shopping Centre, a busy place where discount stores mix with independent shops.. Sarah works for the NHS. She was born in the city and raised her children here. Immigration, she says, has made the city grow very quickly. “We don’t have the resources for everybody,” she tells me.. She reels off a list of pressure points: “The hospital, it’s hard to get accommodation in the city now, especially social housing and school places.” Her grandchildren, she says, have struggled to get a place in the schools closest to them.. These sound like common issues in most towns. “I don't think it's all down to immigration,” Sarah admits, “but I think it has had a major impact on them.”. We found Emma waiting with her son and toddler daughter buying fish and chips. Immigration is a big issue for her in this election.. She is on the council house waiting list, and gets housing benefit, but because of high private rental prices she has to top it up by hundreds of pounds every month.. “The new houses that were built were given to all the foreigners that were coming in,” she says.. In the past year, Peterborough council has bought 40 homes to be used by Afghan and Ukrainian refugees. . “It’s not fair, I’ve always worked my life,” she says. “I don’t like it, it makes me angry.”. Peterborough council says the demand for social housing exceeds supply, and that is prioritising those with the highest needs. The homes were bought for legal refugees, it points out, who have the right to live and work in the country.. These are hard choices for councils. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent economics research institute, says Peterborough receives less funding for local services (that’s bin collections and adult and children’s care) and public health (drug and alcohol abuse) than it should do according to need. Places with growing populations can often find themselves falling victim to funding formulas from central government that do not take account of their recent growth.. Haji moved here as child about 50 years ago from Pakistan, and we met him in a traditional Pakistani sweet shop, where for £7 you can get a box full of treats.. “We worked hard,” he says reflecting on his and his family’s contribution to Britain. “We paid our taxes, National Insurance contributions, the hospital, education system.” He pauses before adding “everything was brilliant”, with the emphasis on the was.. He says he is concerned about migration. “I think it is too much, to be honest, the country has too much on its plate.”. “People who don't contribute towards the system, I think they don't have the right to live here.”. The ONS says the increase in net migration is mostly down to non-EU citizens coming on work and study visas. . This is a key challenge for the Conservative and Labour parties who say they will bring down net migration: many of the people who come to the UK come to work.. That Ipsos research on attitudes to migration also showed little appetite for reducing the numbers of medics, care workers, fruit pickers, teachers, labourers or lorry drivers coming to the UK to work.. Significant numbers of people settle in London and the South East, but Peterborough is attractive because it is well connected by road and rail, and newcomers work in food packing and logistics jobs - the city is part of a transport, logistics and warehousing triangle that’s grown significantly in the past decade or so, mostly down to online shopping.. Care is also a sector with big demand for workers. PJ Care, which provides specialist neurological care for adults, says it has hired more than 32 people from overseas, and its recruitment manager tells me they would struggle without them.. One of their employees is Rejoice, from Malawi. She says she’s thriving, excelling at her job - but still, she’s worried about her future, “When you look at the news, it makes you feel scared. What will become of me?”. She’s watching the general election debate closely, as all parties pitch their plans on immigration. They have very different approaches.. Rejoice is here on a work visa, with her husband and two children. She is one of 70,000 carers who came to work in England from abroad in 2022-2023, up from 10,000 in 2020-2021, according to industry body Skills for Care. It says about a third of the care workforce in Peterborough comes from abroad, and the demand for workers is expected to continue as the population ages.. She works full-time and pays taxes, but is keen to point out that she can’t claim some benefits, like free childcare. But Rejoice says she feels vital: “This country needs people like me, someone that can put their heart out there and help someone from the heart, giving their all.. “If we were to remove every migrant worker from this country, I think there would be a collapse in the health care system in this country.”. Set against this picture is a very public debate about small boats and illegal migration. Home Office figures show that in the 12 months until March, 38,000 people entered the UK illegally, the vast majority on small boats from France.. In conversations on the streets, there is not much distinction made between legal and illegal migration.. Just off Lincoln Road we are welcomed inside Peterborough Asylum and Refugee Community Association (Parca), which has been running for three decades. Asylum seekers Adil and Mohammed are having English lessons, and their English is very good.. Both fled war in Sudan and describe a desperate journey to reach the UK, taking a small boat from Libya to Italy. Adil says 300 people left on the boat, but only 200 people arrived.  “One hundred people dead,” he says quietly. “Women, children, young boys.” It’s hard to even imagine what that was like.. Why make another risky journey from Calais to the UK? Adil says it was because he believed he would not get any support in France.. Parca was set up by Moez Nathu, who was a refugee before finding sanctuary in Peterborough. He says migrants believe that when they get to the UK, “you get five-star hotels to sleep, you’ll get feeding by Home Office”. . While he wants refugees to be supported, he says it creates an impression that people arriving here will have an easy life. The answer, he believes, is to allow asylum seekers to work almost as soon as they arrive, sending a message that if you come to the UK, you will be expected to work.. There were 69,298 asylum applications for the year ending March 2024, relating to relating to 86,719 people. But the number of asylum cases awaiting an initial decision is higher - 86,460 cases, relating to 118,329 people.. And government figures from the same time said there were 104,517 individuals in receipt of asylum support, of which 34% were in hotel accommodation.. Just outside Parca, we find Irena delivering parcels. She’s originally from Latvia and says she works up to 60 hours a week. I jokingly ask what she would do if she were the next prime minister. “I would close the borders!” she says. It’s not the answer we expected.. Irena arrived here 15 years ago, when the UK was part of the EU, and she’s now a British citizen and planning to vote in the general election.. It becomes clear her issue is illegal immigration. “I don't understand why France doesn't close the borders, why they let people risk their lives and cross the channel. If they say the first safe country is OK, why do you pass several safe countries and then England in the end. Why?”. Does she see any conflict between her own journey and her views now? “I'm working. I'm all the time working,” she says, adding that she never asked the state for anything.. Close by we speak to two men inside an eastern European cafe, they are from Peterborough and believe the change here has been for the better. They both point enthusiastically at the restaurants that line Lincoln Road. All of this, they say, would not have happened without immigration.. Rania Alia cofounded Helping Empower Lives in Peterborough. She’s originally from Egypt and is passionate about supporting the most vulnerable here and helping them settle in Britain.. She points to wider forces: “If you don’t want the refugee to come to this country, stop the war, make peace.”. And what of the argument that the country cannot cope with so many people arriving here? “I do not think the asylum, or refugee, is the reason for the crisis we are having,” before adding: “We have this because of Covid, the cost of living is getting very high - refugees don’t cause these problems.”. Rania is a reminder that by no means everyone in Peterborough feels the same about immigration, and what we did hear again and again were questions of what people saw as fairness - be it from Emma, who can’t get a council house, or from Rejoice who works, pays taxes but doesn’t always feel appreciated.. And for many who we spoke to in the city, who were uneasy about the surge in net migration, there was also a widespread understanding that the services they rely on, from health to having parcels delivered, were dependent on the very same people coming from abroad.. The challenge for the parties is to convince voters that after long periods of large-scale migration, they have a credible plan to address the issues and concerns of voters.. And then for whoever wins the keys to No 10, the next challenge will be to deliver that vision..

bbc.com,New Attenborough portrait by Jonathan Yeo unveiled,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6pp2774qq7o,2024-06-25 18:19:50,"A new portrait of Sir David Attenborough has been unveiled, marking the veteran natural history broadcaster's 40 years of fellowship to the Royal Society.. The oil painting is by Jonathan Yeo, who recently created the first official painted portrait of King Charles III since his coronation.. It shows Sir David seated against a green background, looking directly at the viewer with his hands clasped around his knee.. Sir David, who described Yeo as a ""master"", said it was ""extraordinary"" to have his portrait included in the Royal Society's collection.. The work was unveiled on the BBC's The One Show on Tuesday evening.. “To spend so much of my life looking at the natural world and attempting to convey to others its amazing complexity, beauty and increasingly, its fragility, has been a great privilege,"" Sir David said.. He added that his work has only been possible thanks to the natural history film makers and scientists who have shared their skills.. Yeo, who has also painted Sir Tony Blair and Malala Yousafzai, said it was ""a huge honour"" to be asked to paint Sir David's portrait, calling him ""a personal inspiration"".. ""It has been a thrill as well as a privilege to spend so much time with someone whose wisdom is so deep and broad, and who is also such brilliant and entertaining company,” he said.. For the portrait of Charles, Yeo chose a striking red colour.. Last month, animal-rights protesters attacked the painting in a London art gallery, sticking posters on the glass covering. The painting itself was unharmed.. For Sir David, Yeo said he opted for an ""ambiguous natural green background"", as if he ""might be emerging from one of the many habitats he has captured on film during his career”.. Sir David was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1983 for his services to science as a pioneer of public engagement.. The Royal Society said the new portrait celebrates the role Sir David continues to play in educating audiences everywhere on climate change and biodiversity.. Its head of library and archives, Keith Moore, said the body was ""thrilled"" to have the portrait as part of their collections.. ""The Royal Society has many pictures of great scientists,"" he said, listing the likes of Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and Dorothy Hodgkin.. ""But I’d defy you to find anyone who has touched as many people’s lives in explaining the ideas behind great science, and how they affect our world, as Sir David Attenborough. He’s one of a kind.”. The portrait will be on public display at the Royal Society from 2 July.. The Circular Economy Bill, which aims to reduce waste, is expected to be passed in Holyrood on Thursday.. Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan taking part in a three-day state visit to the UK.. King Charles III and Queen Camilla will be visiting Guernsey on 16 July..

bbc.com,Royal Mail buyer to make offer for all staff shares,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce993qynp25o,2024-06-25 21:04:36,"More than 100,000 former and current Royal Mail staff will this week be asked to sell their shares to a Czech billionaire.. On Wednesday morning, Daniel Kretinsky’s investment group, which wants to buy Royal Mail's parent company, will publish its formal offer online and send it by post.. Mr Kretinsky can then formally start lobbying investors to accept the offer.. He needs the approval of shareholders of three quarters of the parent company, but this task will be made easier because he already owns 27.5% of it.. Big asset managers including Blackrock, UBS, Vanguard and Schroders own most of the other 72.5% of International Distribution Services (IDS) that Mr Kretinsky does not own.. Meanwhile, Royal Mail staff still collectively own 5.5% of the shares after qualifying staff received 600 shares in the company at the time of its privatisation in 2013.. Mr Kretinsky made his fortune in energy companies. He also has stakes in Sainsbury's and West Ham Football Club.. The board of IDS has already recommended that shareholders big and small accept his offer of 370p per share.. This is more than the 319p it is currently trading at and substantially above the 220p it was worth before Mr Kretinsky’s first offer to buy the company.. However, the government still has the ability to block this deal, which it may do given Royal Mail's importance to the UK.. Mr Kretinsky’s EP Group has offered a series of time limited guarantees including the retention of the Royal Mail logo, its UK headquarters, and its UK tax base.. It also offered to honour current employment agreements with unions and promised not to split off the profitable parcels business, which IDS also owns.. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said that the deal would be subject to the normal scrutiny but he was not opposed “in principle”. . Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has written to Mr Kretinsky to seek assurances that Royal Mail will remain headquartered and tax-resident in the UK.. My Reynolds also wants a commitment from Mr Kretinsky to “work closely with the Communication Workers Union (CWU) to build a sustainable Royal Mail"".. The CWU is pushing for “a new ownership and governance model that builds a postal service for the workers and customers”.. Sources close to Mr Kretinsky said that they would consider a model which involved some employee ownership or participation.. Daniel Kretinsky said that potentially owning the business would come with huge responsibility.. It marks the sixth consecutive year Royal Mail has fallen short of its postal targets.. Campaigners say a depot at Patcham Court Farm would increase flood risk, sewage leaks and traffic.. Royal Mail's owner IDS said it had received a revised proposal of 370p a share from a Czech billionaire.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,What was on the banquet menu for Japan's emperor?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2vvv2n00g8o,2024-06-25 16:07:50,"King Charles greeted his guests in Japanese as the emperor and empress of Japan were given the full splendour of a Buckingham Palace state banquet.. He toasted the Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako with a message that translated as “Welcome back to Britain”.. The dinner included poached langoustines, basil mousse, Cornish turbot, quail eggs and sorbet and peaches.. In response, the Japanese emperor spoke of how much he had enjoyed being a student in Oxford as a young man.. The state banquet, in the capacious ballroom of the palace, with its elaborate table settings, chandeliers and flower displays, is a centrepiece of a state visit. It’s soft power with sorbet.. With the general election campaign taking place there was interest in the politics of the seating plan.. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was not on the top table, which was occupied by senior royals including the King, Queen, Prince William and the Japanese royal couple.. If there was going to be small talk, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was next to Sir Clive Alderton, private secretary to the King.. Both party leaders are taking part in a TV debate tomorrow night, so they were probably having to forgo the Coates and Seely Brut Reserve, the Chateau Angludet, Margaux and the Laurent Perrier Cuvee Rose.. If there were messages in the music, in the background they were playing numbers including I Don’t Know How to Love Him, Skyfall and They Can’t Take That Away from Me.. The King’s speech talked of the close friendship between the UK and Japan.. “Ours is a partnership with deep roots,” said the King, in areas of science, culture, defence and trade.. He also referenced some Japanese contributions to popular culture, including the Hello Kitty brand and mentioned the “Pokemon phrase ‘gotta catch ‘em all’”.. In response Emperor Naruhito emphasised the importance of the two countries striving for “true mutual understanding” and appeared to refer to previous wartime conflicts when he spoke of building friendships after “times of great difficulty”.. The emperor and empress were on the first day of their state visit, which began with a ceremonial greeting on Horse Guards Parade.. In blazing sunshine they were welcomed by the King and Queen, before taking the traditional carriage ride along the Mall to Buckingham Palace. The empress wore a face mask because of her horse hair allergy.. The Japanese royals brought symbolic gifts, a black lacquerware box for the King and a brocade handbag for the Queen, plus a framed photo of the emperor and empress.. The lacquerware was a reference to this year’s Noto Peninsula earthquake, with this type of design a traditional product of Wajima city that was affected by the earthquake.. King Charles gave his guests a pair of silver and gold beakers and although more normally associated with a drop of Laphroaig whisky, he gave a bottle of Glen Garioch, diplomatically from a Japanese-owned Aberdeenshire distillery. . The Queen presented Empress Masako with a handmade fan incorporating good luck symbols.. In the next few days this diplomatic charm offensive will see the Japanese visitors brought to the Francis Crick Institute, Kew Gardens and for a nostalgic visit to the Oxford colleges where the emperor and empress studied.. As the King said in his Japanese toast, cheers, or “Kanpai.”. The painting marks the veteran natural history broadcaster's 40 years of fellowship to the Royal Society.. King Charles III and Queen Camilla will be visiting Guernsey on 16 July.. The University of Oxford team completed the race first in seven hours 48 minutes and 14 seconds.. The ceremonial welcome marks the start of a three-day state visit to the country.. Voters going to the polls on 4 July will decide who will be the next prime minister.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,Australian rugby star Hayne will not face new rape trial,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ddm41pvvro,2024-06-25 22:59:11,"Former Australian rugby league star Jarryd Hayne will not stand trial for a fourth time in the same rape case, after prosecutors dropped the charges against him.. The 36-year-old won an appeal against his convictions earlier this month.. He has faced trial for the same alleged assault three times, with the first ending in a hung jury and the second's guilty verdict also overturned on appeal.. Hayne has consistently denied he attacked the woman - who cannot legally be named - in her bedroom in 2018, arguing the pair had consensual sex.. One of Australian rugby league's most decorated athletes, Hayne also had a brief NFL career in the US.. In a statement on Tuesday night, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) said it would not pursue the case again, having ""carefully considered the many competing factors"" and assessing what is in the ""public interest”.. “As the reasons for the decision are legally privileged, they will not be disclosed and the ODPP will not comment further,” the statement added.. Hayne has collectively spent almost two years in jail as the legal saga has unfolded, and his accuser has been forced to give evidence and face lengthy cross-examination multiple times.. When handing down their appeal judgment, both judges who upheld Mr Hayne's appeal said they believed a fourth trial should not proceed.. In her written reasons, Justice Deborah Sweeney said that in her view it ""would not be in the interests of justice"".. Justice Rothman agreed, saying a trial was ""unlikely"" to occur before the expiry of Mr Hayne's non-parole period - and that he has already served most of it anyway.. However, both emphasised the future of the case was up to the ODPP.. A former captain of the Parramatta Eels, Mr Hayne twice won the NRL's player of the year award and played 11 Tests for Australia.. At the height of his career in Australia, in 2015 he joined the NFL in the US with the San Francisco 49ers.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,Einstein atomic bomb letter to be auctioned,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxxxx1w9znko,2024-06-25 12:12:22,"A letter from Albert Einstein, which encouraged the US to develop the world's first nuclear bombs, is to go up for auction.. Written to President Franklin D Roosevelt, in 1939, the note warns that Nazi Germany might be able to create such weapons - and suggests the US begins its own atomic programme.. Three years later, America began the Manhattan Project, which led to the first ever use of atomic weapons, against Japan, in 1945.. The letter is being sold as part of an auction of artefacts belonging to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who died in 2018 at the age 65. . Bill Gates, who started the company with Mr Allen, said: ""Personal computing would not have existed without him."". His personal collection is go on sale at Christie's, in New York, in September.. There will be a range of items reflecting his interest in - and influence on - computing, but the Einstein letter is expected to be the centrepiece. . It has been given an estimated value of between $4m and $6m (£3.2m-£4.7m).. It was actually written by Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard with help from other scientists - but it was signed by Einstein because his status as one of the greatest scientific figures of all time made it more likely to get the president's attention. . Dated 2 August 1939 - just weeks before the Second World War was declared - it warns that Germany may have worked out the science to create a nuclear bomb.. ""It is conceivable - though much less certain - that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed,"" it says.. But Einstein is reported to have later regretted the letter due to its role in making America the only country - at the time - to make nuclear weapons.. He was quoted in 1947 as saying: ""Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in producing an atomic bomb, I would never have lifted a finger."". Also being auctioned is a computer from 1971, a DEC PDP-10: KI-10 model which Mr Allen helped restore. . Christie's says this is similar to a model which he would have worked on with Bill Gates when they founded Microsoft. . These types of computers were key in the development in early forms of the internet. . The computer is expected to fetch between $30,000 and $50,000.. And a spacesuit belonging to astronaut Ed White - who became the first American to perform a spacewalk, in 1965 - has an estimated value of $80,000 to $120,000.. In 2022, Mr Allen's art collection set a new world record for the biggest sale in an auction, raising over $1.5bn (£1.2bn).. It included works by Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Vincent Van Gogh.. It was his wish that the proceeds would go to philanthropic causes. . During his life, he donated more than $2bn to charitable causes, set up art and culture museums and also owned various American sports teams.. His net worth at the time of his death was estimated at over $20bn by Forbes.. Copyright 2024 BBC.

bbc.com,"Death of amateur boxer an accident, coroner rules",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy994k5wwz9o,2024-06-25 20:02:17,"A 23-year-old amateur boxer who died after suffering a traumatic brain injury from being punched at a charity fight wanted to work for the NHS, an inquest heard.. Jubal Reji Kurian died four days after he was knocked unconscious during a boxing competition at Harvey Hadden Sports Village in Bilborough, Nottingham, on 25 March 2023.. He suffered bleeding on both sides of his brain, killing his brain stem following the punch to his face, which made him fall backwards on to the ground, the inquest was told. . Coroner Laurinda Bower closed the inquest on Tuesday, concluding Mr Kurian's death was an accident.. Six months before his death, Mr Kurian had moved to the UK to begin a master's degree at the University of Nottingham in sports medicine, but it was his ultimate goal to ""serve the NHS"" as a physiotherapist.. His father described him as a ""highly athletic individual"" who played many sports, but had no experience in boxing, and only revealed his interest in the combat sport days before the match.. In a statement read by the coroner, Mr Kurian's father called him their ""beloved son"" who was a ""cherished member of the family"".. ""Jubal had a particular interest in charitable activities and being a force for good.. ""He was eager to make a meaningful contribution to society.. ""He was a dreamer and an achiever, and set off to Bangalore and pursued a bachelor's in physiotherapy."". Mr Kurian's friend Mr Singh, whom he met while at university in India, was at the fight.. In a statement read by Ms Bower, he said Mr Kurian was ""formidable in the ring"". . ""The tide turned in the third round and seeing him knocked out is a sight that still haunts me,"" it read.. ""His absence is keenly felt and his future unjustly taken."". The inquest heard from Det Sgt Sarah Gregg, of Nottinghamshire Police, who had ruled out criminality during the investigation following Mr Kurian's death.. ""We decided there was no criminal activity because we could see on CCTV that it was a boxing match. Participants had signed waivers to say they undertook a certain amount of risk,"" she told the inquest.. ""There was no intention to assault or cause injury to anyone."". Ms Bower concluded: ""His sudden and unexpected death is a tragedy, especially because he was boxing with the intention of helping others with his efforts of raising money for charity. This speaks to the very honourable man he was."". Addressing Mr Kurian's opponent, Ian David, she said: ""I can't imagine the scale of emotion you have been through. I'm sure you are aware that you bear no responsibility or accountability for what happened."". Ms Bower found that Ultra White Collar Boxing, a club organised by Ultra Events which hosted the charity boxing match, followed the organisation's safety policies and completed the correct medical checks for the amateur boxers before and after the match.. Jonathan Leonard, director of Ultra Events, said: ""The death of Jubal, following this tragic accident, deeply saddened everyone at Ultra Events and we continue to offer our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends at this very sad time.. ""While there is always a level of risk associated with boxing at any level of the sport, the safety and welfare of all our participants is of paramount importance to us."" .

bbc.com,Chris Mason: Why the betting saga matters,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl44y6252d3o,2024-06-26 00:38:39,"Reporting on politics is an exercise in two things: an examination of policies and, often, to bear witness to human fallibility.. Public life, because it should, subjects those who volunteer to be part of it to an intense scrutiny.. Democracy demands that, with reporters asking awkward questions and seeking to find things out to help inform you to make a judgement.. And that is the word that is at the heart of all of this: judgement.. What these revelations may help reveal, at least in part, is something about the judgement of those in senior roles, in office or seeking office.. Let us be clear - in all of the developments in recent days relating to alleged betting, there is a huge amount reporters don’t know.. In plenty of the alleged cases, we don’t know if there was indeed a bet, how much was bet, how many bets there were, precisely what was bet on, what the odds were, what the winnings were or, crucially, what the person placing the bet did or didn’t know about when the election would be.. The circumstances and context of each case could vary wildly, and we should be clear about that.. Journalism can be long-winded and imperfect. We reporters rarely know as much as we would like to know, and we never stop asking questions.. In recent days, I have received tip-offs and made a blizzard of phone calls and inquiries, attempting to piece together elements of this story we have reported online, on TV and on radio.. Other BBC colleagues, the Sunday Times and the Guardian have been doing the same.. For the party leaders in situations like this, they can find themselves prisoners of the alleged behaviour of others.. Imagine you were Rishi Sunak, or Keir Starmer after today’s revelation about a Labour candidate. You’d be incandescent.. But you will also be judged by your response. The nature of it and the speed of it.. Labour is attempting to make a virtue of their relative speed in disowning their candidate who’d had a flutter and contrasting it with what they see as Tory tardiness.. But the actions of a leader can also create awkward precedents and hostages to fortune. How many other candidates might have had a flutter on their fortunes or others?. I cannot remember the closing stages of an election campaign so dominated by a horror show of daily developments on one topic like the one we are currently witnessing.. And, as I have said before in recent days and I will say again, there is every prospect we have not yet heard the last of this..

Labour suspended Kevin Craig as its candidate for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich after learning the Gambling Commission had launched an investigation into him.. The seat was won by Conservative candidate Dan Poulter in 2019 with a majority of just over 20,000. Mr Poulter later defected to Labour.. In a statement on social media, Mr Craig said he ""did not place this bet with any prior knowledge of the outcome"" and had planned on ""giving any winnings to local charities"".. ""This was a huge mistake, for which I apologise unreservedly,"" he said.. ""I have so much respect for how Keir Starmer has changed the Labour Party and I have been fighting so hard to win this seat and change the country alongside him.. ""However, it is right that the party upholds the highest standards for its Parliamentary candidates - just as the public expects the highest standards from any party hoping to serve in government."". The Labour Party has also returned a £100,000 donation made by Mr Craig in May 2023. A prolific donor, Mr Craig has given Labour £196,600 since 2005.. A Labour spokeswoman said: ""With Keir Starmer as leader, the Labour party upholds the highest standards for our parliamentary candidates, as the public rightly expects from any party hoping to serve, which is why we have acted immediately in this case."".

Click on the drop-down list to select the nation, political parties and issues that interest you.. Most of the parties have launched their manifestos. We will update the guide in the coming days as the final parties outline their pledges.. A manifesto is the list of pledges parties make to voters, explaining what they would do if elected.. This interactive has been put together by the BBC's Visual Journalism team, the BBC's political research unit in London and BBC journalists in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow.. Its aim is to summarise where the parties stand on key topics to help voters make informed decisions at the ballot box.. We have selected issues highlighted in polling company Ipsos Mori's Issues Index, a monthly survey that measures the things the public believe to be the most important facing the country.. We analysed surveys from the twelve months before the election was called and selected the issues based on their aggregate score over that period.. In some cases we have combined similar issues for simplicity. For example, ""NHS, hospitals, healthcare and social care"" are included under the one category of ""NHS and care"".. ""Democracy"" was added as an issue on the editorial grounds that it help fulfil the BBC's public service commitments.. In order for a party to be included in the guide it must be standing candidates in at least one sixth of seats in the nation it is campaigning in as well as meeting one of the following criteria:. Parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2019 general election - and then alphabetically.. You can see a full list of all parties standing at the general election here.. This is an editorial process overseen by BBC journalists. All parties included in the guide have contacted by the BBC and given the opportunity to identify their key policies in each area.. Because of devolution, the UK parliament cannot rule on, or has limited powers over, some of the issues highlighted in the guide. For example, ""health"" is devolved to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.. Parties do still campaign locally on these devolved issues in the run up to a general election.. For this reason, the guide highlights issues that are devolved or partly devolved to acknowledge that these policies may not become law in that nation even if they are passed in Westminster..

There will also be a lot of interest in Tory seats where the Lib Dems are the main challengers. Reform UK, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party are also aiming to pick up seats. . In Scotland the SNP start from a dominant position, holding 48 of the 57 seats being contested, based on new boundaries. . So it will be seats they’re defending where most of the action takes place.. In Northern Ireland different parties are contesting the election so the pattern is different again.. This map shows the 50 constituencies that require the smallest swing for Labour to take them. In other words, they’re the seats where the smallest number of voters would have to switch for Labour to win. . Forty-seven of them are currently held by the Conservatives and three by the SNP.. If Labour gained all these seats it wouldn’t be nearly enough for them to win a majority but it would, just, deprive the Conservatives of theirs.. One thing that’s very noticeable about the map is that a lot of these top Labour targets are clustered together in particular parts of the country.. View the information in these maps in table format. . Greater Manchester and Lancashire, North Wales and West Yorkshire alone account for a third of them. If you add in West Midlands seats and a cluster in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, it takes it up to a half.. Constituencies in this area include Burnley, Labour’s number one target, Clwyd North, Gedling, and Walsall & Bloxwich.. By contrast there very few top targets in the south of England. In many southern counties there are none at all.. Now let’s look at Labour’s top 125 targets. This is the number of seats they need to gain to win an overall majority, while holding on to the 201 they took in 2019.. It’s still true that all the Scottish seats are currently SNP and all the seats in England and Wales are Conservative with one exception: Ceredigion Preseli which is currently held by Plaid Cymru.. Mostly, it’s the same regions as before that dominate the map. There are 20 targets in the North West, and lots in Yorkshire & The Humber, the East and West Midlands, and Wales.. There’s also a cluster of seats on the northern edge of London and further out on the A1 or M1. Plus quite a few along the south coast including Truro & Falmouth, Bournemouth West, Bournemouth East, East Worthing & Shoreham, and Hastings & Rye.. The big difference is that there are now 20 seats highlighted in Scotland – all of them held by the SNP, and overwhelmingly concentrated in the central belt. . They include all the seats in Glasgow, Airdrie & Shotts and Edinburgh North & Leith.. That tells an important story about Labour’s potential path to power. If they can pick up a significant number of SNP-held seats it reduces the swing they need from the Conservatives in England and Wales to win a majority.. It’s not just Labour looking to gain seats from the Conservatives - and of course different parties may target the same seats. . This map shows the Liberal Democrats top 30 target seats, again based on the swing they need to win.. It includes three constituencies that did have a Lib Dem MP but where the boundary changes mean another party is now notionally defending the seat: Caithness Sutherland & Easter Ross, North East Fife - now both SNP under the boundary changes - and Westmorland & Lonsdale, now notionally Conservative-held.. In England and Wales most of the Lib Dem targets are Conservative seats. And in Scotland they’re all SNP seats.. The Lib Dems’ top targets are also geographically concentrated – in particular in south west London and Surrey, but more generally across the south east of England.. Some of them are seats that have elected Conservative MPs for decades, including Esher & Walton, Woking, and Didcot & Wantage.. For the Green Party and Reform UK the first past the post system used at Westminster elections makes it hard to turn support across the country into seats in Parliament. So both parties are concentrating on a relatively small number of seats.. The Greens say they have four principal targets: Brighton Pavilion, which they already control, Bristol Central, Waveney Valley and North Herefordshire.. Reform UK’s campaign is focused on seats where either they, or predecessor parties, have done well before, including Hartlepool, Boston & Skegness, Clacton and the two seats in Barnsley where they came second in 2019.. Plaid Cymru’s top targets are Ynys Môn and Caerfyrddin. Both of them are three way battles with the Conservatives and Labour.. Of course, the Conservatives and SNP would ideally like to gain additional seats – not just defend the ones they already have. . Opinion polls suggest this will be tricky but their best chances are likely to be where they start off with the smallest deficit to make up. . You can see those seats in the table below.. And you also can’t rule out seats with big majorities changing hands. . That has been a fairly common occurrence at recent general elections and many polls suggest Labour could end up gaining seats much further down the target list than the 125 they need for a majority.. Of course, there’s always a possibility that the polls are wrong - or there could be a significant shift late on in the campaign - which would mean different seats could be in play. . And there’s no guarantee that different nations and regions of Britain will show a consistent pattern.. In Northern Ireland all the main parties are involved in the battleground seats either as defender or challenger – and six of the 18 seats have majorities under 10%.. Fermanagh & South Tyrone has been the most marginal constituency across the whole of the UK twice in recent elections, and nobody has won it by more than 1,000 votes since 2005. . It’s looking like another close battle there between Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist party.. Belfast East will be watched particularly intently. The DUP’s interim leader, Gavin Robinson, is defending the marginal seat against Alliance Party leader Naomi Long. . The other candidates are Séamas de Faoite for the SDLP, John Ross for the TUV and Brian Smyth for the Greens.. Maps show notional results in the 2019 general election for new constituency boundaries, based on analysis by Rallings & Thrasher, Professor David Denver (Scotland) and Nicholas Whyte (Northern Ireland).. . The betting revelations reveal something about the judgement of those in senior roles..

A number of the polls this week suggest that the Conservatives are now in a close battle with Reform UK for second place.. On average, the Conservatives are still ahead of Reform but several polling companies now put the two neck and neck.

Its members agree to the same rules on transparency, but the council has said membership should not be seen as a guarantee of quality.. The polls we include have come from BMG, Deltapoll, Electoral Calculus, Find Out Now, Focaldata, Ipsos, JL Partners, More in Common, Opinium, Norstat (formerly Panelbase), People Polling, Redfield and Wilton Strategies, Savanta, Survation, Techne, Verian (formerly Kantar Public), WeThink (formerly Omnisis), Whitestone Insight and YouGov.. We only include the headline percentages on voting intention, which pollsters calculate by excluding or otherwise adjusting for those people who answered ""don't know"" or ""won't vote"".. Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK. People surveyed do not get the option to choose parties which only stand in Northern Ireland.. We include data that is in the public domain. Some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time.. Where polling companies have stated in their data tables who their client is, we have included this in our table. It is common for polling companies to do their work for news organisations, television programmes and campaign groups. . The true position for the Conservatives and Labour might be within five percentage points of our average.. Nine out of 10 polls just before election day have been within that range of the eventual national vote shares in the 2010 to 2019 general elections.. The gap has been smaller for other parties which campaign throughout Great Britain, such as the Liberal Democrats, Green party and Reform UK (formerly the Brexit Party) and smaller still for the SNP and Plaid Cymru.. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls.. A party's share on any given day is the average of their results from polls taken over the previous fortnight. We only take the most recent poll from each company for that day's averages.. All opinion polls will differ a bit because they are interviewing different people. There are also other things that can lead to differences between polling companies. For example:. Different companies find the people who take part in their polls in different ways. The precise wording of the question varies between pollsters, and some pollsters ask more than one question to reach their voting intention figures. Pollsters apply ""weights"" to their data to try to make their results reflect the make-up of the voting population. So if a particular poll has a smaller proportion of female respondents than there are in the wider population, their responses will be given extra weight in the final results. But different companies take different factors into account. The companies have different ways of treating people who initially say they do not know how they will vote, or are not certain if they will vote.. For voting intention, polling companies typically ask interviewees a question along the lines of: ""If a general election were held tomorrow, which party would you vote for?"". Some polling companies have not given their interviewees the choice of some parties, including them within the ""other"" category.. For example, Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party until 2021, has only been included as an option in every poll featured in our tracker since autumn 2022, while support for Plaid Cymru is included among ""other"" parties in polls released by Techne..

bbc.com,Tories pull support for candidates over bet scandal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg33mvm8mvro,2024-06-25 16:42:28,"The Conservative party have withdrawn support from two candidates who are under investigation for alleged betting on the date of the general election.. Both Craig Williams, the candidate in Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr, and Laura Saunders, the candidate in Bristol North West, are being looked into by the Gambling Commission.. The pair will still appear on the ballot under Conservative party banners but this decision means they will become independent if elected, pending the result of an investigation.. The Met Police says allegations about five further officers are being looked into by the Gambling Commission, following the arrest of one of the PM's close protection officers.. Following the Conservatives' decision to pull support, Mr Williams posted a video on X, directed at voters in Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr, in which he said he remained committed to standing in the constituency. . He said he had ""committed an error of judgment, not an offence"" adding: ""I want to reiterate my apology directly to you.. ""I am fully co-operating with routine inquiries from the Gambling Commission and I intend to clear my name.. ""In all these things, due process is important and that is what sets the UK apart from other countries, and the commission must be allowed to do its work."". Last week, a spokesperson for Ms Saunders said she would be co-operating with the Gambling Commission and had nothing further to add.. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""As a result of ongoing internal enquiries, we have concluded that we can no longer support Craig Williams or Laura Saunders as parliamentary candidates at the forthcoming general election. . ""We have checked with the Gambling Commission that this decision does not compromise the investigation that they are conducting, which is rightly independent and ongoing."". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, commenting on the news that support had been withdrawn from the candidates, said: “Why didn’t that happen a week ago?”. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: ""This should have happened immediately when these scandalous revelations emerged, but instead Rishi Sunak has dithered and delayed."". Two sources earlier told the BBC that the party board had held urgent discussions about how to handle the row.. Mr Sunak has said he is “incredibly angry” about the allegations and denied being aware of any other candidates being involved.. Two members of Conservative staff have also taken leaves of absence from their roles after it emerged they were being looked into by the Gambling Commission.. A police officer assigned to the protection of Mr Sunak has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office and is on restricted duties with the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command.. A Met Police spokesperson has confirmed five further officers are alleged to have placed bets on the timing of the general election and investigation is underway by the Gambling Commission.. The Met said: “It is still the case that only one officer is under criminal investigation.. “We have, however, been passed information from the Gambling Commission alleging that five further officers have placed bets related to the timing of the election.. ""The officers have not been arrested but the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards has been informed."". The spokesperson added the officers included at least one more from the Royalty and Specialist Command, as well as the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command and the Central West Basic Command Unit. . None of the officers work in a close protection role, they added, and decisions on whether they will be subject to any restrictions will be taken in due course.. The Metropolitan Police has denied reports that it leaked the names of people being investigated about alleged bets on the election date. . A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: ""The people of Wales deserve better than London parties mired in scandals."". A Reform UK spokesman asked how voters could back the Tories following news of the withdrawal of support.. The Green Party declined to comment. .

bbc.com,Met denies being source of election bet leaks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnkkk5ky0k2o,2024-06-25 04:31:39,"The Metropolitan Police has denied being the source of leaks identifying the people being investigated by the Gambling Commission over alleged bets on the date of the general election.. The Daily Telegraph has reported what it calls ‘""a source close to the Cabinet Office"" claiming that Scotland Yard had told journalists about those being looked into by the betting regulator.. Police sources have told the BBC the force regards this as an attempted distraction and it is not behind the disclosure of names.. The Met is not being drawn on how many of its officers are being investigated by the Gambling Commission, beyond the constable it acknowledged was being looked into last week, who was arrested and questioned.. The BBC understands there are a ""handful"" of other officers being looked at by the commission, but it is not yet known how many.. The regulator has not said who it is investigating but so far the names of four Conservatives have emerged - including two who are standing for election. . In a statement the Met Police said: ""The allegations that the Met has leaked information are simply untrue.”. A senior source added: ""This is a poor distraction technique."". It also emerged in the same Daily Telegraph article that the Gambling Commission has sent the Met Police information that more officers could possibly be involved in the election betting scandal.. The Met said: “We continue to liaise with the Gambling Commission and are assessing information they have provided.”. The BBC understands the new information relates to a “handful” of officers, but is more sketchy than the information which led to one member of the prime minister's prime minister’s close protection team being arrested and questioned under caution last week on suspicion of misconduct in public office.. The Met’s assessment of the new information is understood to be at a very early stage.. Any investigation into alleged cheating in bets on the date of the election would remain with the Gambling Commission.. Allegations first emerged earlier this month against Craig Williams - one of the prime minister's closest aides - who reportedly placed a £100 bet on a July polling day three days before the date was named.. Mr Williams, who is standing for the Conservatives in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, told the BBC he had made a ""huge error of judgement"" but refused to say if he had placed a bet on the basis of inside information.. If someone uses confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting, this could be a criminal offence under section 42 of the Gambling Act.. Laura Saunders, the Conservative candidate for Bristol North West, and her partner Tony Lee, the Conservative director of campaigning, are also under investigation, as is Nick Mason, the party's chief data officer.. Mr Mason's spokesperson said he denied wrongdoing. Both Mr Mason and Mr Lee have taken leaves of absence from their party roles.. The BBC understands other people linked to the Conservative Party and the government are also being looked into by the Gambling Commission. . On Monday Rishi Sunak said he was not aware of any other Tory election candidates being investigated by the Gambling Commission over alleged bets on the date of the general election.. The prime minister also confirmed that his party was carrying out its own internal inquiries ""in parallel"" with the regulator's investigation. . Mr Sunak added that he would ""act on any relevant findings"" and pass on information to the commission.. He has come under pressure from opposition parties, as well as some Conservatives, to suspend the two candidates being looked at by the regulator. . Over the weekend, Labour's election coordinator Pat McFadden wrote to the Gambling Commission urging it to ""make public the names of other figures"" under investigation.. In a reply seen by the BBC, Andrew Rhodes, the regulator's chief executive, said: ""We understand the desire for information, however, to protect the integrity of the investigation and to ensure a fair and just outcome, we are unable to comment on any details at this time, including the name of any person who may be under suspicion."".

bbc.com,"Greens' tax rises are modest, insists co-leader",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14448vez8eo,2024-06-24 17:00:49,"The co-leader of the Greens has defended the scale of his party's tax plans, calling them ""fairly modest"" by European standards.. Adrian Ramsay told the BBC the extra £172bn per year his party would raise by 2030 was needed for public services and lowering carbon emissions.. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has accused the party of making ""wholly unattainable"" promises to voters. . But Mr Ramsay said his party's proposals would take the UK ""closer to where the average European country is"".. In an interview with the BBC's Nick Robinson, he said the Greens were the ""only party being honest"" about the need for additional revenue.. It is Labour and the Conservatives, he added, that are ""way out of step with what other countries are doing"".. Both parties plan to keep tax rates frozen until 2028, dragging more people into higher bands as wages rise.. But amid the backdrop of rising debt and the UK's overall tax levels rising to a post-war high in the wake of Covid, they have been otherwise reluctant to propose large-scale tax increases.. By contrast, the Green Party of England and Wales says it wants to raise an additional £172bn in tax annually by the end of the decade to fund extra investment in public services, particularly the NHS.. It also says it would increase government borrowing by around £80bn a year and spend an extra £90bn on long-term investment in decarbonising the economy, health and education, and social housing.. Key to the party's plans is a proposed new tax on carbon emissions generated by domestic fossil fuel extraction and imports, which it estimates would raise an extra £91bn a year by the end of the decade.. It also wants to introduce a 1% ""wealth tax"" on assets worth over £10m, and 2% on assets worth more than £1bn, and raise National Insurance (NI) on annual wages above £50,270.. The IFS think tank has previously said that also some measures would target the wealthy, ""the effects of the package would be much broader"". . In an analysis of manifestos on Monday, it added that the Greens' tax and spending plans, along with Reform UK, are offering ""much bigger numbers"" than the main parties.. ""But the way they suggest that they have radical ideas which can realistically make a positive difference, when in fact what they propose is wholly unattainable, helps to poison the entire political debate,"" it added.. Pressed on the comments, Mr Ramsay said other economists had said praised the Greens for offering a ""different way of thinking, that by European standards is actually fairly normal"".. ""The Institute for Fiscal Studies has been very clear that the next government is either going to have to cut public services, or increase taxes,"" he added.. ""The Green Party is the only party being honest in this election, that says, actually, by European standards, we can make fairly modest changes to the tax system, asking those with the broadest shoulders to pay modestly more."". In 2022, the most recent year for international comparisons, the amount of tax raised in the UK as a proportion of the size of the economy was 35.3%.. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), this is higher than some European countries such as Poland (35.2%), Hungary (33.2%) and Ireland (20.9%), the lowest in Europe.. But it is still lower than many other countries, including Germany (39.3%), Italy (42.9%), Austria (43.1%) and France (46.1%). . The effect of the Greens' plans, however, would ultimately depend on how much revenue they raised and the effect on economic growth..

Later, when facing a financial blockade, it adopted bitcoin for donations, providing vital funding for Wikileaks and simultaneously enhancing BTC's legitimacy and utility.In 2017, when rumors circulated that Assange was dead, he read off the latest bitcoin block hash as a proof-of-life.During his legal battle with the U.S. and U.K governments, Assange and Wikileaks supporters turned to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to help fundraise for his legal fight, raising over 16,500 ether – over $55.2 million at current prices – for his defense.Edited by Omkar Godbole."
coindesk.com,Mt. Gox Effect? Bitcoin Dominance Drops Most in 5 Months,https://www.coindesk.com//markets/2024/06/25/mt-gox-effect-bitcoin-dominance-drops-most-in-5-months/,2024-06-25 07:46:00,"BTC's dominance rate slid as Mt. Gox news weighs over BTC.Short-duration options show renewed bias for puts or downside protection.Some observers say Mt. Gox concerns may be overblown.Bitcoin (BTC) is usually less volatile than alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), but Monday was different.The leading cryptocurrency took a bigger hit than smaller tokens, leading to a marked slide in its market dominance in a compelling portrayal of the apprehensions about the impact of impending payouts to victims of a 2014 Mt. Gox hack.BTC's dominance, or share of total crypto market value, fell by 1.8% to 54.34%, the biggest single-day percentage decline since Jan. 12, according to charting platform TradingView. In other words, investors likely pulled money from bitcoin faster than from its peers. The cryptocurrency's price fell nearly 5%, hitting lows under $59,000 at one point, CoinDesk data show.The sell-off was not without cause. News that the defunct crypto exchange planned to distribute 140,000 BTC to the hack victims in July bolstered concerns the recipients would look to sell once they had their payouts, creating a supply overhang in the market. That added to pressures mounting since June 7 due to faster selling by miners and outflows from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).Sell-off concerns boosted demand for short-term BTC put options on the Deribit exchange, according to data tracked by Amberdata. Put options offer protection against price slides in the underlying asset.The seven-day and one-month call-put skews, which indicate what traders are willing to pay to acquire an asymmetric payout in the upward or downward direction over one week and one month, have flipped negative. That's a sign of renewed demand for puts.Some observers, however, say the actual selling pressure from Mt. Gox reimbursements may be more measured.""The exact amount of Mt.

Other contracts asking if Trump's son Barron Trump had some involvement also resolved to No, but they are going through that same dispute process.Despite this, the DJT token added more than 30% in the last 24 hours.An investigation by ZachXBT concluded that Martin “Pharma Bro” Shkreli, a convicted felon, was behind the token, which Shkreli confirmed – though he continues to claim that Barron Trump also participated in the project.While the Trump campaign has not officially commented on the DJT token, DL News reported that insiders say there is no official involvement.Roger Stone, a Republican political consultant and ally of Trump, also said there was no official involvement, and that Barron was also not involved.Edited by Sheldon Reback."
coindesk.com,"Biden Likely to Win Popular Vote, but Lose Presidency, Prediction Market Signals",https://www.coindesk.com//news-analysis/2024/06/24/biden-likely-to-win-popular-vote-but-not-presidency-prediction-market-signals/,2024-06-24 16:22:00,"This week in prediction markets:Joe Biden likely will win the popular vote – but not the election, Polymarket prices signal.The incumbent U.S. president isn't accepting crypto donations (yet).Barron Trump’s alleged involvement with the Martin Shkreli-backed DJT token is … a matter of debate.Donald Trump is one of only five U.S. presidents who won the electoral college, and thus the nation's highest office, despite losing the popular vote. If prediction markets are correct, he will repeat that feat this year.On Polymarket's contract asking who will win the popular vote, ""yes"" shares for President Joe Biden are trading at 56 cents, indicating the market sees a 56% chance of the incumbent prevailing. Each share pays out $1 (in the USDC stablecoin) if the prediction comes true, and zero if it does not.Trump, meanwhile, has only a 36% chance of winning the popular vote, according to recent prices. Traders have bet $36 million on this question, making it Polymarket's fourth-largest market by volume.The largest by far, of course, is the one on who will win the presidency, with a record $182 million of bets placed. Here, Trump is the clear favorite, with a 57% chance of winning versus 35% for Biden.Under a regulatory settlement, Polymarket blocks U.S. users, so its traders are presumably making predictions from afar. PredictIt, a more traditional U.S. election betting site that settles bets in dollars with a quasi-regulatory blessing, gives Trump a 52% chance of winning the presidency and Biden 47%. The volume there is comparatively small, though, at $15.7 million.The Electoral College was conceived at the Constitutional Convention of 1787. It is designed to balance the influence of populous and less populous states, ensure smaller states have a voice in the election, and prevent a few large states from dominating the outcome. The popular vote, which carries no electoral weight, is simply the proportion of votes cast for each candidate.The college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electors' votes is required to win the presidency. Each state has the same number of electors as it does members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member of the House of Representatives (the number of House members is proportional to a state's population) plus two Senators.Critics of this time-honored system call it undemocratic, while its defenders argue that it is a bulwark protecting the rights of the minority against potential tyranny of the majority. This much seems certain: If the Polymarket bettors are right and Trump does win the electoral college while losing the popular vote, ""Not My President"" rallies will be back in vogue.Donation negationNearly two weeks after a report surfaced that Biden would follow Trump in accepting cryptocurrency donations, the president's campaign still hasn't done so, to the detriment of Polymarket traders who bet it would.To be fair, the ""Biden accepts crypto donations by Friday?"" contract, which launched June 12, had a tight timeframe of nine days. The odds were as high as 48% early on but plummeted to zero. The market resolved to ""no"" on June 21, because the campaign had made no such announcement.If Biden is weighing the option as claimed, it's still possible an announcement could come later. That's one of the risks of prediction markets: It's possible to make a bet that's directionally correct but still lose money because it didn't come true within the agreed-upon timeframe.Read more: He Exposed Harvard President's Plagiarism, Then Lost Money Betting on the StoryTrump's wholehearted embrace of crypto in May was followed by signs the Biden administration was softening its hardline stance against the industry, making plausible the scenario in which the incumbent would accept crypto donations.Barron dramaWas Donald Trump's son Barron really a part of the team behind the Solana-based DJT token that dominated crypto headlines and discourse last week?A Polymarket contract on that mystery resolved to ""no"" on Sunday but that decision was disputed. It resolved again to ""no"" and was disputed a second time. A final review is ongoing. It is expected to be closed Tuesday.Drama erupted on Monday in the Discord forum for UMA, the third-party oracle service responsible for refereeing bets on Polymarket. The forum was packed with “yes” shareholders making the case that their bet was correct.At issue is whether ""a preponderance of evidence suggests that Barron Trump was involved in the creation of the Solana token $DJT,"" as spelled out in the Polymarket rules.Neither the Trump campaign nor Barron have made any public statements about the matter, so those insisting the preponderance of the evidence suggests his involvement are relying largely on the word of Martin ""Pharma Bro"" Shkreli, who served six years in prison for securities fraud.Shkreli said last week he created the token with Barron’s involvement following a contentious $100 million bet with popular crypto traders.The relatively new token made waves in the community over its supposed status as the “official” Trump token, buoyed mainly by reports alleging Barron was part of the team. Pseudonymous promoters gushed that the token was going to billions of dollars in market cap, and prices rocketed thousands of percent in a week.But radio silence from the Trump family soon caught on among followers. DJT prices have slumped more than 50% to 1 cent on Monday since a 3-cent peak on June 18.With the review pending, Polymarket traders are giving the claim a 19% of being true as of U.S. morning hours on Monday, down from a peak of 60% when the market was created on June 21. It has clocked over $693,000 in volumes, making it Polymarket's second-largest market on a crypto-related question.Edited by Nick Baker."

There's also a runoff in South Carolina and a special election in Colorado.. All eyes on 3 high-profile primaries Tuesday. Today is one of the most jam-packed primary election days of the year: Democrats and Republicans in Colorado, New York, Utah and parts of South Carolina will pick their party's nominees for this fall's elections.. Two incumbent representatives — Jamaal Bowman and Lauren Boebert — who have made enemies inside and outside their own parties are facing serious challengers in their primaries tonight. In two districts in Colorado, Republicans may nominate far-right candidates who could put normally safe red districts in play. Conservative hardliners are also hoping to win several seats in Utah, including retiring Sen. Mitt Romney's seat.. Also on the docket: Democrats will pick their fighters in two competitive New York House districts that could help them reclaim the House majority. And a special election in Colorado could get interesting if Democrats overperform the way they've been doing in special elections.. All told, there are over a dozen elections we're watching tonight, and as usual, 538 reporters and contributors will be live-blogging the results as they come in. Join us below for up-to-the-minute vote counts and analysis.. There's a reason why we average! The Ohio race was super sleepy. This Colorado race was taking place at the same time as a high-profile Republican primary election in the same district. Best not to read anything too much into any individual result.. —Jacob Rubashkin, Inside Elections. As you mentioned earlier, Jacob, Trump won Colorado's 4th District by 19 points in 2020, so Lopez's 21-point win is pretty much exactly in line with the partisanship of the district. That's notable in a year when Democrats have made a lot of hay out of their overperformances in recent special elections, like in Ohio's 6th District a couple weeks ago. It's a good reminder that individual special election results can be noisy. That said, Democrats are still punching above their weight in special elections this year on average by about 6 points, and historically, overperformance in special elections has augured general-election success.. —Nathaniel Rakich, 538. The AP projects that Greg Lopez will win the special election for Colorado's 4th District, which was vacated by Republican Ken Buck. The former Parker, Colorado, mayor leads Democrat Trisha Calvarese, 58 to 35 percent, with 80 percent of the expected vote counted.. —Jacob Rubashkin, Inside Elections. The AP now estimates that 48 percent of the expected vote has reported in the Democratic primary for New York's 16th District, and Latimer holds a 10-point lead over Bowman, 55 percent to 45 percent. Latimer is winning 63 percent of the vote in Westchester County, which he leads as county executive, and which will cast the vast majority of votes in this seat. A projection may not be far away here.. —Geoffrey Skelley, 538. "

The Supreme Court, nearing the end of its term, is poised to soon deliver rulings in high-profile cases on everything from presidential power to abortion access.. The justices will release opinions on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week. It will mark the first time in at least a decade the justices have done three opinion days in a row.. The timing means key decisions, some with enormous consequences for the 2024 campaign, could be handed down just before President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump meet on stage in Atlanta for their first debate.. . Blockbuster cases still to be resolved include whether Trump is immune from criminal prosecution on charges stemming from his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss; whether hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters were improperly charged with obstruction; and whether a federal law protecting emergency care overrides a state abortion ban.. Here is a deeper dive into the some of the dozen cases pending before the nation’s high court.. In what is likely the most consequential case before the court this term, the justices will decide whether a former president is shielded from criminal liability for ""official acts"" taken while in the White House.. In Trump v. United States, Trump is seeking to quash the federal election subversion case brought by special counsel Jack Smith by claiming immunity.. . Lower courts flatly rejected Trump's argument, but the justices appeared open to the idea of some level of immunity for former presidents when they heard arguments in April. Their questioning largely focused on what types of official acts would be protected and which would not.. How the justices make that determination will set a new standard for presidential power, and will affect whether Trump stands trial for his unprecedented actions in the aftermath of the 2020 election.. A felony obstruction charge used by federal prosecutors against alleged Jan. 6 rioters is being put to the test in Fischer v. United States.. A former Pennsylvania police officer charged for his alleged participation in the U.S. Capitol attack is challenging the government's use of a 2002 law enacted to prevent the destruction of evidence in financial crimes. The law includes a sweeping provision for any conduct that ""otherwise obstructs, influences or impedes an official proceeding."". The Supreme Court appeared divided on whether the government's broad interpretation of the law should stand or be narrowed, with conservatives on the bench questioning the lack of prosecutions under the law for matters unrelated to financial or documentary crimes.. The court's decision could upend hundreds of Jan. 6 cases, including Trump's. Felony obstruction is one of the four charges the former president is facing in his federal election subversion case.. In Moyle v. United States, the question before the court is whether a federal law requiring emergency rooms to provide stabilizing care to all patients overrides Idaho’s strict abortion ban.. Idaho's law prohibits nearly all abortions, with exceptions in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is at risk.. . The Biden administration argues the law is conflict with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, which requires hospitals receiving Medicare funds to provide “necessary stabilizing treatment."". The case marks the first time the court is evaluating state-level abortion restrictions passed after the fall of Roe v. Wade. Since the court's conservative majority struck down Roe, 21 states have successfully enacted restrictions or bans on abortion and 14 of those states have total bans with few exceptions.. In the most significant case on homelessness in decades, the justices are weighing whether a local ordinance to bar anyone without a permanent residency from sleeping outside amounts to “cruel and unusual” punishment under the Eighth Amendment.. Officials in Grants Pass, Oregon argue the ordinance is necessary to protect public spaces and encourage a growing tide of unhoused residents to seek shelter. A lower court ruled that punishing homeless people with fines and the possibility of jail time for public camping when they have nowhere else to go is unconstitutional.. A majority of Supreme Court justices seemed to favor the city's arguments when it heard the case in April.. The Supreme Court will determine whether state laws restricting how social media companies moderate content violate the First Amendment.. The measures from Florida and Texas seek to place limits on how the private companies can manage user accounts and feeds on their platforms. Both were passed amid conservative concerns that Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, were censoring viewpoints on their site based on politics.. . In another case, Murthy v. Missouri, the justices will decide if the Biden administration went too far in communicating with social media companies about misinformation on their sites about COVID-19 and the 2020 election.. Republican-led states argued the government's conduct amounted to illegally coercion, while the administration argued their contact with the companies was aimed at protecting national security and public health.. The justices appeared likely to reject the states' challenge and side with the Biden administration when it heard arguments in March.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

Two NASA astronauts have no set date to return to Earth and are stuck waiting aboard the International Space Station (ISS) due to several mechanical issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.. Starliner launched on June 5 from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, with flight commander Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and flight pilot Sunita ""Suni"" Williams onboard, arriving at the ISS one day later.. The mission is part of the larger Commercial Crew Program at NASA, which was testing if Boeing's spacecrafts could be certified to perform routine missions to and from the ISS.. . The pair were originally scheduled to return on June 14 but have since had their return delayed multiple times, and currently do not have a planned date to return to Earth.. ""We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,"" Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said in a statement. ""We are letting the data drive our decision making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking."". Boeing and NASA have said the crew is currently not in danger because they are aboard the ISS with plenty of supplies in orbit, and the station's schedule is relatively open through mid-August.. NASA and Boeing say Wilmore and Williams are ""integrated"" with the Expedition 71 crew aboard the ISS and are helping the crew with station operations as needed as well as completing ""objectives"" needed for NASA's possible certification of Starliner.. ""The crew's feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and they know that every bit of learning we do on the Crew Flight Test will improve and sharpen our experience for future crews,"" Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Starliner program, said in a statement.. . Starliner has been plagued by issues even before launch. The flight test was originally tentatively scheduled for May 6, but was scrubbed after a problem with an oxygen valve on a rocket from United Launch Alliance (ULA), which manufactures and operates the rockets that launch spacecraft into orbit.. A new launch date had been set for May 25, but a small helium leak was discovered in the service module, which contains support systems and instruments for operating a spacecraft.. Helium leaks and a thruster issue then threatened to delay Starliner's docking. Five days after docking at the ISS, NASA and Boeing said the spacecraft was experiencing five ""small"" helium leaks and, at the time, said enough helium was available for the return mission.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Health officials tell US doctors to be alert for dengue as cases ramp up worldwide,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/health-officials-us-doctors-alert-dengue-cases-ramp-111416955,2024-06-25 19:02:19,"U.S. health officials are warning doctors to be alert for dengue cases as the tropical disease breaks international records. NEW YORK -- U.S. health officials on Tuesday warned doctors to be alert for dengue cases as the tropical disease breaks international records.. The virus, which is spread by mosquitoes, has been surging worldwide, helped by climate change. In barely six months, countries in the Americas have already broken calendar-year records for dengue cases.. The World Health Organization declared an emergency in December, and Puerto Rico declared a public health emergency in March.. Dengue remains less common in the continental United States, but in the 50 states so far this year there have been three times more cases than at the same point last year. Most were infections that travelers got abroad, and officials note there is no evidence of a current outbreak. But they also warn that local mosquitos pose a threat.. In its health alert Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised doctors to know the symptoms, ask questions about where patients recently traveled and consider ordering dengue tests when appropriate.. Dengue (pronounced DEHN'-gay) is caused by a virus spread by a type of warm weather mosquito that is expanding its geographic reach because of climate change, experts say. . Many infected people don’t get sick, but some experience headache, fever and flu-like symptoms. Severe cases can involve cause serious bleeding, shock and death.. Repeated infections can be especially dangerous.. There are four types of dengue virus, simply known as 1, 2, 3 and 4. When someone is first infected, their body builds antibodies against that type for life. If they get infected with another type of dengue, the antibodies from the first infection may fail to neutralize the second type — and actually can help the virus enter immune cells and replicate.. That's a concern in Puerto Rico, which for the last two decades has been widely exposed to type 1. Last month, the island reported its first dengue death of the year. . “We’re currently seeing is increases in the cases due to dengue 2 and dengue 3, for which the population has very little immunity,” said Dr. Gabriela Paz-Bailey, the Puerto-Rico-based chief of the CDC's dengue branch.. There is no widely available medicine for treating dengue infections. . Vaccines have been tricky. U.S. officials in 2021 recommended one vaccine, made by Sanofi Pasteur. The three-dose vaccine is built to protect against all four dengue types and is recommended only for children ages 9 to 16 who have laboratory evidence of an earlier dengue infection and who live in an area — like Puerto Rico — where dengue is common.. Given those restrictions and other issues, it hasn't been widely used. As of late last month, only about 140 children had been vaccinated in Puerto Rico since shots became available there in 2022, and Sanofi Pasteur has told the CDC it is going to stop making the vaccine. . A different vaccine made by the Tokyo-based pharmaceutical company Takeda is not currently licensed in the U.S. Others are in development.. Across the world, more than 6.6 million infections were reported by about 80 countries last year. In the first four months of this year, 7.9 million cases and 4,000 deaths have been reported, according to the World Health Organization. It's been particularly intense in the Americas, including in Brazil and Peru.. In the United States, the numbers have been far more modest — about 3,000 cases last year in U.S. states and territories. But it was the worst in a decade, and included more infections that occurred locally, courtesy of native mosquitoes. Most were in Puerto Rico, but about 180 were in three U.S. states — Florida, Texas and California. . So far this year, there have been nearly 1,500 locally-acquired U.S. cases, nearly all of them in Puerto Rico.. Most cases in the continental U.S. continue to be people who were infected while traveling internationally. . It's ""a traveler's nightmare” and a growing international concern, said Dr. Lulu Bravo, who studies pediatric tropical diseases at the University of the Philippines Manila and who has worked with Takeda on its vaccine.. “When you have an outbreak in a country, tourists might not want to come,” Bravo said.. ___.

abcnews.com,"NTSB reveals cause of 2023 toxic train crash in East Palestine, Ohio",https://abcnews.go.com/US/ntsb-reveals-cause-2023-toxic-train-crash-east/story?id=111398249,2024-06-25 16:24:34,"The derailment prompted the evacuation of more than 2,000 residents.. Federal investigators confirmed Tuesday that a hot railcar wheel bearing sparked a fire and caused the massive derailment of a Norfolk Southern train carrying tank cars with hazardous materials in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023. Investigators said a series of missteps, faulty track sensors and delayed communications about the train's toxic cargo from the railroad company contributed to the disaster.. In its final report on the Feb. 3, 2023, crash, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the crash which caused the evacuation of more than 2,000 residents and endangered the lives of first responders could have been avoided.. ""Today we present our findings mindful of the challenges faced by those affected. We are here to ensure that the lessons learned from this derailment will lead to meaningful change so no other community has to relive the challenges faced by the people of East Palestine,"" Mike Graham, an NTSB board member, said Tuesday during a public hearing in East Palestine.. Jennifer Homendy, chair of the NTSB, opened the hearing by apologizing on behalf of her agency to the residents of East Palestine, saying some outside the NTSB sought to minimize the toxic threat caused by the crash because no one was killed or injured.. ""The absence of a fatality or injury does not mean the presence of safety,"" Homendy said.. Researchers estimate that 110 million residents in 16 states, or one-third of the nation's population, were impacted by pollution, according to a study published in the Environmental Research Letters.. The findings released Tuesday confirmed and expanded on findings in the preliminary investigative report the NTSB released about three weeks after the crash.. Officials said the train comprised three locomotives and 149 freight rail cars, including 17 tank cars loaded with hazardous materials. The crash caused 38 rail cars to derail, officials said.. Eleven of the derailed cars were tank cars carrying flammable and combustible material, including vinyl chloride chloroethene.. ""Post-accident inspections revealed that about 25% of the cars had federal defective conditions,"" NTSB investigator Ruben Payan said while giving a summary of the agency's investigative findings.. The investigation focused on the wheel bearing of rail car 23 that caught fire and caused the axle to fall off and derail the train in East Palestine around 8:54 p.m. local time, resulting in an explosion and fire, Payan said.. The crash occurred as the train was en route from Madison, Illinois, to the Conway Yard in Pennsylvania.. Before the crash, the train's rail cars were inspected in Toledo, Ohio, and again in Decatur, Illinois, and no obvious defects were detected, Payan said.. He said investigators reviewed video taken from security cameras of private homes and businesses along the route from Decatur to East Palestine and saw the wheel bearing of car 23 initially glowing from being overheated to being in flames as the train approached East Palestine.. NTSB investigators said the train tracks are equipped with sensors to detect dangerously overheated bearings and trigger critical alarms to the crew.. As the train passed through Salem, Ohio, about 17 miles from East Palestine, an alarm was triggered and alerted a Norfolk back office analyst, who deemed it non-critical because the trackside sensor only showed car 23's wheel bearing at 103 degrees, the NTSB investigation found. Investigators said the sensor did not properly detect the true temperature of the overheated bearing and that Norfolk Southern's policies don't call for a train to be stopped and inspected until the hot bearing reaches at least 115 degrees.. As the train approached East Palestine, critical alarms sounded on the train indicating that the overheated bearing had reached 253 degrees, prompting the train operator to apply the brakes in an attempt to stop the train, which was traveling at 42 mph, NTSB investigators said. By then, investigators said it was too late to avoid the derailment.. . The NTSB also found that when East Palestine police and firefighters arrived on the scene at around 9 p.m. the incident commander called the Norfolk Southern center in Atlanta to ask what hazardous materials were in the derailed tank cars. The person who picked up the phone said they would check but did not get back to the incident commander, NTSB officials said.. Fire crews attempting to extinguish the fire with water didn't learn of the specific hazardous materials on the train until 10 p.m.. . About 2,000 residents in the vicinity of the crash were initially ordered to shelter in place, NTSB officials said. But around 11 p.m., fire officials, who learned some of the derailed tankers contained vinyl chloride chloroethene, ordered the residents to evacuate. Around midnight, volunteer firefighters stopped batting the blaze, retreated to a safe distance and moved the command center back, according to the NTSB.. NTSB also found it was unnecessary for Norfolk Southern to recommend firefighters perform what was described as a ""vent and burn"" procedure on the tank cars containing vinyl chloride, sending a toxic plume of smoke into the air and causing further potential health hazards.. . The NTSB made several recommendations to prevent similar incidents, including ways to advance the speed of communication between Norfolk Southern and first responders and establishing standards for how railroads should respond to bearing failure alarms. The agency, whose recommendations are not binding, also suggested that the Federal Railroad Administration establish rules governing railroad responses to the alarms.. In addition, the agency recommended establishing a database to report hot wheel-bearing incidents.. The agency also recommended that volunteer firefighters receive training on how to handle emergencies involving hazardous materials.. ""We will continue to pursue and advocate for these safety recommendations until each one is implemented,"" Graham said.. In April, Norfolk Southern agreed to a $600 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit stemming from the train derailment. The settlement was approved by a judge in May.. ""The agreement is designed to provide finality and flexibility for settlement class members,"" the company said in a statement at the time. ""Individuals and businesses will be able to use compensation from the settlement in any manner they see fit to address potential adverse impacts from the derailment. This could include healthcare needs and medical monitoring, property restoration and diminution, and compensation for any net business loss."". On Tuesday, the company issued a new statement saying it has implemented measures to address the Federal Railroad Administration's recommendation from its 2023 Safety Culture Assessment.. Some of the recommendations Norfolk Southern addressed are similar to those of the NTSB, including approving communications, training, trust and ""going above and beyond"" regulatory minimums.. ""We appreciate the strong partnership with FRA on advancing safety and are grateful for its thorough assessment of our culture and their thoughtful recommendations, all of which serve as building blocks to our goal of becoming the gold standard for safety in the industry,"" said Alan H. Shaw, president and CEO of Norfolk Southern.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

JACKSON, Wyo. -- Crews were almost done building a temporary route on Tuesday around a landslide that closed a vital road for thousands of workers in a western Wyoming resort town.. Wyoming Department of Transportation officials were eyeing Friday to reopen Wyoming Highway 22. The road over Teton Pass near the Idaho state line has been closed since the landslide sent both lanes crashing into a deep ravine June 8.. No one was hurt when the pavement gave way. The road was already closed because another landslide had washed mud and debris across the road nearby.. Yet the collapse was a big headache for thousands of commuters. Many people work in Jackson — a ski and tourism hub at the doorstep of Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks where the average home costs millions — and live in more affordable eastern Idaho.. The destroyed highway has been forcing them to take a different route to the south, adding over an hour to their commute each way.. Cars will need to slow down through the temporary section to 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour) but won't have to stop, said Bob Hammond, an engineer with the Wyoming Department of Transportation. The two paved lanes will span about 600-700 feet (180-230 meters).. “We have a steeper grade, which really isn’t that big of a problem. But the turns are a little tighter,” Hammond said during a news media site tour Tuesday.. A permanent fix costing perhaps upward of $20 million will take longer, Hammond said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee's top election office has sent letters to more than 14,000 registered voters asking them to prove their citizenship, a move that alarmed voting rights advocates as possible intimidation.. The letters, dated June 13, warned that it is illegal in Tennessee for noncitizens to vote and provided instructions on how to update voter information. The list was developed after comparing voter rolls with data from the state Department of Safety and Homeland Security, said Doug Kufner, spokesperson for the Secretary of State's office, in a statement Tuesday. . Kufner described the data from the state's homeland security department as a “snapshot” of a person's first interaction with that agency. Some may not have been U.S. citizens when they obtained a driver's license or ID card but have since been naturalized and “likely did not update their records,"" he said. Driver's licenses in Tennessee must be renewed every eight years.. “Accurate voter rolls are a vital component to ensuring election integrity, and Tennessee law makes it clear that only eligible voters are allowed to participate in Tennessee elections,” Kufner said. . The letter does not, however, reveal what would happen to those who do not update their records — including whether people who fail to respond will be purged from the voter rolls. Kufner did not immediately respond to an email seeking clarity on if voters were at risk of being removed.. Instead, the letter contains warnings that illegal voting is a felony and carries penalties of up to two years in prison.. Voting rights advocates began raising the alarm after photos of the letter started circulating on social media. Democrats have long criticized the Secretary of State's office for its stances on voting issues in the Republican-dominant state. . “The fact legal citizens of the United States and residents of Tennessee are being accused of not being eligible to vote is an affront to democracy,"" said state Rep. Jason Powell, a Democrat from Nashville, in a statement. “These fine Tennesseans are being burdened with re-proving their own voter eligibility and threatened with imprisonment in a scare tactic reminiscent of Jim Crow laws.”. Powell and fellow Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons on Tuesday urged Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti to investigate the issue. . Democratic Rep. Gloria Johnson, a Democrat from Knoxville, said she was informed that one of the letter recipients included a “respected scientist in Oak Ridge” who had become a citizen and registered to vote in 2022. . “Maybe the state should verify citizenship with the federal government before sending threatening/intimidating letters to new citizens,” Johnson posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.. Other leaders encouraged those who received a letter to reach out to the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee for possible legal resources.. ""It is surely capturing many, many, many eligible citizens on the rolls and threatening them with criminal prosecution,"" said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights program at The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law. “I think it’s unconscionable. And I think that it likely violates a number of federal laws as well.”. The effort bears some resemblance to the rollout of a sweeping Texas voting law passed in 2021, in which thousands of Texans — including some U.S. citizens — received letters saying they have been flagged as potential noncitizens who could be kicked off voting rolls.. Texas officials had just settled a lawsuit in 2019 after a prior search for ineligible voters flagged nearly 100,000 registered voters but wrongly captured naturalized citizens. A federal judge who halted the search the month after it began noted that only about 80 people to that point had been identified as potentially ineligible to vote.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

DETROIT -- The city of Detroit is taking steps to ban gas stations from locking people inside the store, a year after a man was fatally shot during an argument with another customer.. Police said a clerk's decision to lock the door while he was safely behind protective glass contributed to the shooting. . An ordinance approved Tuesday by the Detroit City Council would make it illegal for employees to push a button to remotely lock the door. It would apply to businesses whose workers are protected by glass, The Detroit News reported.. “The goal of this is to ensure that we keep the threat outside the convenience store, gas station, liquor stores or party stores,” council member James Tate said..

abcnews.com,Town in Washington state to pay $15 million to parents of 13-year-old who drowned at summer camp,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/town-washington-state-pay-15-million-parents-13-111420252,2024-06-25 16:41:04,"A town in Washington state will pay the parents of a teen $15 million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit they filed after he drowned during a town summer camp outing. SEATTLE -- A town in Washington state will pay the parents of a teenage boy $15 million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit they filed after he drowned during a town summer camp outing. . Darrell “DJ” McCutcheon, Jr., disappeared under water in Florence Lake on Anderson Island southwest of Seattle on July 15, 2022, according to Pierce County Court records. . Brett Rosen, an attorney for the McCutcheon family, told The Seattle Times this week that Steilacoom agreed to pay $15 million to settle their lawsuit in late April.. A camp employee had left 13-year-old DJ and other teenagers at the lake that day while he went to pick up another group of children and a co-worker at the ferry station nearby, court records show. . DJ, who had never swum in open water before and was not given a life jacket, was underwater for about six minutes before bystanders rescued him and began performing CPR. He was flown to a hospital and died that day, court records said.. Earnest Roberts, who was walking on the beach at the time, swam out and spotted the 13-year-old about 10 feet (3 meters) under the water and pulled him to the surface. . “If he was adequately and property supervised as part of the summer camp group ... that boy would not have died,"" Roberts said, according to court records.. The boy's parents, Tamicia and Darrell McCutcheon Sr., sued the town for negligence.. “The most important thing for them is to never have this happen to another child,"" Rosen said. . Paul Loveless, Steilacoom’s administrator, and Amanda Kuehn, its attorney, declined to talk to the newspaper, citing ongoing litigation because final dismissal paperwork had not yet been filed. . In a January court filing, the town sought to dismiss the couple’s wrongful-death claim, saying Tamicia McCutcheon had signed a waiver accepting risks including injury or death from participating in activities in or near water. . The couple’s attorneys argued the “generic release” form did not describe any situations where the children would be taken to open water.. The McCutcheons’ attorneys also said that camp employees planned the outing knowing they would have to transport the campers from the ferry station in two groups, leaving one by the water. That decision violated a policy in the town’s staff training manual which said campers “must be under the supervision of a staff person at all times during program hours,” court records show.. The McCutcheons plan to use the settlement money to start a nonprofit dedicated to promoting summer camp aquatic safety and to create scholarships in their son’s name, Rosen said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

The House Judiciary Committee plans to take the first step toward holding President Joe Biden's ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer, in contempt of Congress, two sources familiar with the committee's plans tell ABC News.. The committee plans to hold a ""markup"" on the contempt resolution on Thursday, which would be followed by a committee vote, the sources said. The move would pave the way for a floor vote in the House to hold Zwonitzer in contempt. . The news of the committee's plans was first reported by ABC News.. In March, Republican House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan subpoenaed Zwonitzer after he failed to turn over documents, including transcripts, audio and video recordings of his interviews with Biden for the president's two memoirs, ""Promises to Keep"" and ""Promise Me, Dad."". In a copy of the resolution obtained by ABC News, Republicans point repeatedly to special counsel Robert Hur's investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents. . Hur's report stated that Biden relied ""extensively on the notebooks' notes he took during his vice presidency"" in the writing of ""Promise Me, Dad"" and referred to the notebooks during interviews with Zwonitzer.. ""Mr. Biden told Zwonitzer that some of the information in the notebook may be classified. Some of these entries remain classified up to the Top Secret level,"" Hur stated in his report. . . The report suggested that Biden was not consistent in how he handled classified information, stating he appeared to have sometimes ""stopped at or skipped over the potentially classified material"" while also stating that at other times, Biden ""read his notes from classified meetings to Zwonitzer nearly word for word."". According to Hur's report, Zwonitzer deleted recordings of interviews he conducted with Biden after he learned of the special counsel's investigation but voluntarily turned over his notes and devices. Hur decided not to pursue charges against Biden or Zwonitzer.. House Republicans insist Zwonitzer's failure to fully comply with the House Judiciary Committee has ""hindered"" their own investigation. . . ""Zwonitzer continues to withhold all documents and materials in his possession that are responsive to the subpoena from the Committee,"" the resolution states. ""The materials requested from Zwonitzer are crucial for the Committee's understanding of the manner and extent of President Biden's mishandling and unlawful disclosure of classified materials, as well as Zwonitzer's use, storage and deletion of classified materials on his computer."". ABC News has reached out to Zwonitzer's attorney for comment.. The move comes after the House of Representatives voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for refusing to turn over the audio of Biden's interview with Hur to the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. The DOJ later said it has declined to prosecute Garland for contempt, according to a letter obtained by ABC News.. House Speaker Mike Johnson called the vote to hold Garland in contempt ""a significant step in maintaining the integrity of our oversight processes and responsibilities."". 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

LONDON -- Police allegedly fired live ammunition at anti-government protesters in Kenya's capital on Tuesday, as thousands of people demonstrated against proposed tax hikes in the East African nation.. At least five people were shot dead during Tuesday's clashes between police and protesters in Nairobi, according to Amnesty International. Another 31 people were injured, the organization said. There were also 52 arrests, per Amnesty International.. Images and videos circulating online purportedly show several protesters with bullet wounds in the Kenyan capital.. Kenya announced the country's armed forces were responding ""in support of the National Police Service in response to the security emergency caused by the ongoing violent protests in various parts of the Republic of Kenya resulting in destruction and breaching of critical infrastructure."". The Kenya Human Rights Commission posted video on the social media platform X showing police shooting at protesters as they marched near Nairobi City Hall. The watchdog body said its staff witnessed at least one protester die from the gunshots.. ""We strongly condemn the police killing,"" the Kenya Human Rights Commission wrote in a post on X. ""Such actions are unacceptable and constitute a grave violation of human rights. Justice and accountability are imperative. We will vigorously push for police accountability."". Scores of protesters were seen breaching the complex housing Kenya's Parliament, where lawmakers had just voted to approve a contentious finance bill that raises some taxes. A section of the building was set on fire, forcing lawmakers to evacuate.. In a joint statement from embassies of several countries, including the United States, Netherlands and Germany, they said, ""We are deeply concerned by the violence witnessed in many parts of the country during the recent protests, and are especially shocked by the scenes witnessed outside the Kenyan Parliament. We regret the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained including by the use of live fire."". The Biden administration has cultivated a close relationship with Kenyan President William Ruto, naming the country a major non-NATO ally and honoring Ruto with a state visit just last month.. ""We condemn the violence reported during protests in Nairobi and around Kenya,"" State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said, reading from a statement at a briefing Tuesday. ""We mourn the loss of life and injuries sustained and offer our condolences to the families who lost loved ones. We urge restraint to restore order and provide space for dialogue."". . The demonstrations have also been taking place nationwide, including in Ruto's hometown of Eldoret.. At least 12 people have been allegedly abducted or have forcibly disappeared in connection to the ongoing protests, according to Kenya's Police Reforms Working Group. The abductions reportedly occurred over the past five days, intensifying on Monday. In a statement posted on X, Kenyan Chief Justice Martha Koome said the reports of protesters being abducted are of ""deep concern"" and a ""direct assault on the rule of law."". Several notable Kenyan figures have joined in the nationwide demonstrations, including former U.S. President Barack Obama's half-sister, Auma Obama, who was among those protesting in Nairobi on Tuesday. Auma Obama, 64, was with a group of protesters being interviewed by CNN on a live broadcast when they were apparently tear-gassed.. The controversial legislation in question is aimed at raising $2.7 billion in revenue to alleviate debt and reduce borrowing. But critics argue corruption and greed at the hands of Kenya's politicians have stolen money from the economy and that ordinary people should not be the ones to pay the price.. Following protests last Tuesday, Ruto's office announced they made amendments to the bill ""in account of the views of the people and other stakeholders during public participation sessions."". 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

A multifaith group of Louisiana families with children in public schools is suing to challenge Louisiana's new law requiring all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments.. HB 71 mandates public schools -- from kindergarten to the collegiate level -- to display the Ten Commandments, a religious set of rules from the Old Testament, in every classroom on “a poster or framed document that is at least 11 inches by 14 inches.”. The suit, filed in federal court Monday, argues that the law violates U.S. Supreme Court precedent, pointing to the Stone v. Graham case in which the court overturned a similar state law, holding that the separation of church and state bars public schools from posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms.. The nine families -- who are Jewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist and nonreligious -- also argue the law is religious coercion and violates their First Amendment rights. The parents represented include rabbis, pastors, and reverends.. “Permanently posting the Ten Commandments in every Louisiana public school classroom – rendering them unavoidable – unconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration and adoption of the state’s favored religious scripture,"" the complaint reads.. It continues, ""It also sends the harmful and religiously divisive message that students who do not subscribe to the Ten Commandments -- or, more precisely, to the specific version of the Ten Commandments that H.B. 71 requires schools to display -- do not belong in their own school community and should refrain from expressing any faith practices or beliefs that are not aligned with the state’s religious preferences.”. Supporters of HB 71 argue that the law isn’t about religion: “This is not preaching a Christian religion. It’s not preaching any religion. It’s teaching a moral code,” the bill's primary sponsor and Republican state Rep. Dodie Horton said during an April hearing, according to local news outlet WWL-TV.. The law argues that the Ten Commandments are also historically significant, reflecting ""the understanding of the founders of our nation with respect to the necessity of civic morality to a functional self-government,"" the text reads.. “If you want to respect the rule of law, you gotta start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses,"" Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said last week during the press conference where he signed the bills.. The bill is one of 18 signed by Landry as part of his “Dream Big” education plan that aims to “bring back common sense in our classrooms,” he said in a recent statement.. Horton declined to comment. Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill have not yet returned ABC News' requests for comment.. Public schools have until January 2025 to display the poster, which will be paid for by private donations and not state dollars, according to the law.

abcnews.com,The Lahaina fire worsened Maui's housing shortage. Now officials eye limiting tourist Airbnb rentals,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/maui-ponders-future-leaders-restricting-vacation-rentals-loved-111392702,2024-06-25 13:02:31,"The mayor of Maui County in Hawaii wants to stop owners of thousands of vacation properties from renting to visitors. HONOLULU -- Alicia Humiston bought her condo in Lahaina after she visited Maui and fell for its rainforests, lava fields and the whales that gather offshore. She travels there about three times a year and rents out her unit for short periods when she's not in Hawaii.. “Maui was my dream place,” she said in a phone interview from her home in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.. But now Maui's mayor wants to make it impossible for Humiston and thousands of other condo owners to rent their properties to tourists. Instead, he wants them rented long-term to Maui locals to address a chronic housing shortage that reached a new crisis point after last August's deadly wildfire burned the homes of 12,000 residents.. The mayor's proposal faces multiple legislative and bureaucratic hurdles, starting Tuesday with a Maui Planning Commission meeting. Yet it has inflamed an already-heated debate about the future of one of the world's best-known travel destinations: Will Maui continue to cater to tourists, who power the local economy? Or will it curb tourism to address persistent complaints that visitors are overwhelming the island's beaches and roads and making housing unaffordable?. About one-third of Maui's visitors use vacation rentals. They tend to cost less than hotels and are easy to reserve on websites like Airbnb and VRBO. Many have kitchens, so families can prepare their own food.. They have also become a source of strife, particularly after last year's conflagration in Lahaina — the deadliest wildfire in the U.S. in more than a century. The fire tore through the historic town, killing at least 101 people and leaving nothing but rubble and ash for blocks. Thousands of displaced locals were temporarily housed in hotels usually reserved for tourists, and most survivors still lack stable housing.. Even before the fire, University of Hawaii researchers say so many property owners were renting to tourists — and so few new dwellings were being built — that Maui County suffered a net loss of housing since 2019.. An analysis of property tax records shows 85% of Maui County's condos are owned by out-of-state residents, said Justin Tyndall, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization. Transitioning them would boost Maui’s residential housing stock by 13%, which Tyndall said would almost certainly lead to lower buying prices and rents.. Maui Mayor Richard Bissen believes that under his proposal, those lower rents would keep locals on Maui because absentee landlords would be forced to either sell their units or convert them to long-term rentals.. There are 7,000 condo units in apartment zones, including 2,200 in West Maui near the Lahaina burn zone, and they account for about half of Maui’s legally operated short-term rentals. If enacted, the change would take effect in West Maui no later than July 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2026 elsewhere.. “We understand that there’s going to be a give and take. So the question is, what is most important?” Bissen said at a news conference last month. “My priority is housing our local residents - especially now.”. Humiston, president of the Hawaii Rental By Owner Awareness Association, which opposes the bill, won't sell her one-bedroom, oceanfront condo that she bought two decades ago if the bill became law. She also doesn’t plan to rent it long-term.. “It would take my ability to use my property. And I bought it for my use,” she said. “I love it there.”. Some warn that reducing the supply of lodging for visitors will ruin the tourism industry Maui's economy depends on, though backers of the mayor's bill say many vacation rentals will remain and hotels will have empty rooms visitors can stay in.. Hawaii economist Paul Brewbaker calculates that changing the rules for the affected units, which account for one-third of Maui’s visitor accommodations, would result in 33% fewer tourists and cost Maui 14,000 jobs. He called it a “slow-motion train-wreck” that would lead to an “economic crash and burn.”. Maui County Chair Alice Lee said that while housing for residents is a real concern, the council must also consider legal challenges from property owners and the potential hit on tax revenue.. The county collects $500 million in real property taxes annually and more than 40% comes from short-term rentals, which are taxed at a higher rate than owner-occupied residences, she said.. “We are being sued by over 600 people regarding the fire. We have that many lawsuits pending. Do we really want to put ourselves in a position to invite thousands more?” Lee said. “I really don’t think so, because my main concern right now, at this very moment, is to pay the bills and keep the lights on.”. The county has budgeted $300,000 to study the bill's impact on tax revenue and businesses like landscaping and cleaning services.. Jeremy Stice, a real estate agent who was born and raised on Maui, and his wife have spent 12 years building a company that today manages more than 40 vacation rental properties, mostly for other owners. About half of them would be affected by the measure, said Stice, who is also president of the Maui Vacation Rental Association.. Stice isn't sure local residents would buy — or could afford — short-term rental units even if they do become available for permanent housing.. For example, a studio in Papakea, one of the targeted condo complexes, would sell for about $600,000, he said. A 30-year-fixed mortgage at current interest rates, plus the homeowner association fees, would total about $5,000 a month for a small space, he said.. If locals don't buy them, and tourists don't rent them, it's possible the units would sit mostly empty as second homes for wealthy absentee owners — an even worse outcome.. To prevent that, the county should raise taxes on second homes, create incentives to promote long-term rentals and prioritize new housing construction, said Matt Jachowski, a Maui housing data consultant.. “The only way out of this housing crisis is to do everything — to do everything in our power to add more resident housing,” he said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

BILLINGS, Mont. -- Two Montana inmates were charged with attempted murder Tuesday after allegedly using makeshift weapons to attack corrections officers in a county jail, sending one of the officers to the hospital with stab wounds to the head.. The two inmates pleaded not guilty during court appearances via video from the Yellowstone County jail.. The two officers were targeted in an unprovoked attack Saturday night, Sheriff Mike Linder said. The attack was captured on security cameras but Linder declined to release the footage.. At Tuesday's hearing, prosecutor Hojae Chung with the Yellowstone County Attorney's Office said one of the inmates used a makeshift knife to repeatedly stab one of the officers in the back of the head, causing serious bleeding. That officer was treated at a hospital and released later that night and is expected to make a full recovery, the sheriff said. . Judge Bradley Kneeland set bond on Tuesday at $1 million for Myron Scott Goes Ahead, 20, and $500,000 for Ashtin Zant Glen, 18. The two inmates face additional weapons charges. They could be sentenced to up to life in prison if convicted on attempted murder. Goes Ahead was being held in jail while awaiting trial on two murder charges stemming from a shooting last year in Billings that killed a man, who then fell on a boy who also died. Goes Ahead and another person were accused of stealing ammunition from a sporting goods store and then firing a spray of bullets into the house with the victims. The boy, who was almost 1 year old, suffocated after the man who had been carrying him was shot and fell on top of him, authorities said.. Glen was being held on charges including attempted murder. Authorities said he's accused of shooting and wounding a man during a gunfight last year and later firing at deputies as he fled from the scene.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Jury awards $700k to Seattle protesters jailed for writing anti-police slogans in chalk on barricade,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/jury-awards-700k-seattle-protesters-jailed-writing-anti-111420180,2024-06-25 16:40:10,"Four protesters have been awarded nearly $700,000 after they were jailed for writing anti-police slogans in chalk on a temporary police barricade on Jan. 1, 2021. Four protesters who were jailed for writing anti-police graffiti in chalk on a temporary barricade near a Seattle police precinct have been awarded nearly $700,000 after a federal court jury decided their civil rights were violated.. The Jan. 1, 2021, arrests of the four followed the intense Black Lives Matter protests that rocked Seattle and numerous other cities throughout the world the previous summer in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a Black man. He was killed when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for about 9 1/2 minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe.. “The tensions of that summer and the feelings that were alive in the city at that time are obviously a big part of this case,” said Nathaniel Flack, one of the attorneys for the four protesters. “And what the evidence showed was that it was animus towards Black Lives Matter protesters that motivated the arrests and jailing of the plaintiffs.”. Derek Tucson, Robin Snyder, Monsieree De Castro and Erik Moya-Delgado were each awarded $20,000 in compensatory damages and $150,000 in punitive damages when the 10-person jury returned its verdict late Friday.. The lawsuit was filed in federal court against the city of Seattle and four police officers, Ryan Kennard, Dylan Nelson, Alexander Patton and Michele Letizia. The jury found the city and officers arrested and jailed the four as retaliation, and the officers acted with malice, reckless disregard or oppression denying the plaintiffs their First Amendment rights.. Email messages sent Tuesday to the Seattle city attorney’s office, Seattle police and the police guild seeking comment were not immediately returned.. On New Year’s Day 2021, the four protesters had used chalk and charcoal to write messages like “Peaceful Protest” and “Free Them All” on a temporary barricade near the police department’s East Precinct. Body cam images introduced at trial showed at last three police cruisers responded to the scene to arrest the four for violating the city’s anti-graffiti laws.. The four spent one night in jail, but they were never prosecuted.. Flack said testimony presented at trial showed police don’t usually enforce the law banning the use of sidewalk chalk. In fact, attorneys showed video of officers writing “I (heart) POLICE” with chalk on a sidewalk at another event in Seattle.. Flack said it was also unusual the four were jailed because it came during an outbreak of COVID-19 and only the most serious offenders were to be incarcerated.. “These officers were doing what they called the ‘protester exception’, which meant that if you’re a protester, if you have a certain message or a certain kind of speech that you’re putting out there, then they will book you into jail,” Flack said.. “The jury not only found that the individual officers were doing that, but that there was actually a broader practice that the city leadership knew about and was responsible for as well,” he said.. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said this should be a warning and a lesson to police officers and other government officials across the county who violate the First Amendment rights of citizens.. “This was a content-based and viewpoint-based law enforcement decision that resulted in our clients being locked up for what they had to say,” Flack said. “The important thing here is that the police cannot jail people for the content of their speech.”. ___.

abcnews.com,Judge considering if ex-gang leader held in Tupac Shakur killing gets house arrest on $750K bail,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/gang-leader-held-tupac-shakur-killing-house-arrest-111391795,2024-06-25 18:14:15,"A Nevada judge says she'll review financial documents before deciding if a former Los Angeles-area gang leader will be freed from jail on $750,000 bail ahead of his murder trial in the 1996 killing of hip-hop music legend Tupac Shakur. LAS VEGAS -- A Nevada judge said Tuesday she wasn't immediately convinced of the legality of an effort by a hip-hop music figure to underwrite a $750,000 bond to free a former Los Angeles-area gang leader from jail ahead of his murder trial in the 1996 killing of hip-hop music legend Tupac Shakur in Las Vegas.. Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny expressed doubts after hearing arguments about granting Duane “Keffe D” Davis’ release to house arrest with electronic monitoring, but said she would review financial records submitted by his benefactor — Cash Jones, a manager of hip-hop artists including Johnathan “Blueface” Porter and Jayceon “The Game” Taylor.. The judge promised to post a brief description of her decision in the court record. She did not say when.. Davis' attorney, Carl Arnold, told reporters outside court that he hoped for a decision later Tuesday. Prosecutors Binu Palal and Marc DiGiacomo declined to comment.. Jones, who uses the moniker “Wack 100,"" offered sworn testimony by internet video link from an unspecified place in California. Under questioning by Arnold, Jones said he paid 15% of the bail amount, or $112,500, as “a gift” from his business accounts to secure Davis' release.. “I know him in passing,” Jones said of Davis, a 61-year-old self-described head of a Crips gang sect in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton who has been held at the Clark County Detention Center since his arrest last September. Davis and his attorneys have said he isn’t getting proper medical care in jail following treatment before his arrest for colon cancer.. “I know his son,"" Jones said of Davis. ""We talked a few times. I know he's having an issue with his health.”. “He’s always been a monumental person in our community,” Jones added during questioning by Palal. “Especially the urban community.”. Asked by the prosecutor if he had any contract or financial agreement with Davis for a television or movie deal based on Davis' self-described gang life and role in the killing of Shakur, Jones twice said, “Not as of yet.”. Nevada has a law sometimes called a “slayer statute” that prohibits convicted killers from profiting from their crime. Jailhouse visits and telephone calls are also routinely recorded.. The prosecutor played clips from a VladTV social media interview in which Jones told his interviewer he would bail Davis out of jail “in return for an agreement to do a series on Mr. Davis' life."" Palal asked Jones to explain.. “That's what I said to Vlad,” Jones responded, noting that he was paid for the interview to draw viewers. “There's nothing about Vlad, nothing about YouTube, that says you have to be truthful.”. Palal also played a recording of a jailhouse phone call in which Jones describes to Davis a plan to produce “30 to 40 episodes” of a television show based on his life story.. “We talking business. I'm telling you what my idea is,"" Jones says. “You gotta remember bro, this (expletive) can set you up for the rest of your life.” . Palal told the judge that Jones intended to profit from Davis' story.. “Mr. Davis is getting the benefits from retelling his story in the killing of Mr. Shakur. As a result, Mr. Jones, in order to benefit from that, is paying the bail bond company,” the prosecutor said. “Although it's convoluted, it's clear that a fraud is being perpetrated on this court. One way or another ... it is an illegal benefit, profiting from this crime."". The judge ended the 45-minute hearing saying she was “left with more questions than answers.” But she agreed to review Jones' financial records.. Davis has sought to be released since shortly after his arrest last September made him the only person ever charged with a crime in a killing that for 27 years has drawn intense interest and speculation. . Davis told Kierny in court in February that backers were “hesitant to come in here and help me out on the bail because of the media and the circus that’s going on.”. Prosecutors allege the gunfire that killed Shakur stemmed from competition between East Coast members of a Bloods gang sect and West Coast groups of a Crips sect, including Davis, for dominance in a musical genre known at the time as “gangsta rap.”. Davis has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. His trial is scheduled Nov. 4. If convicted, he could spend the rest of his life in prison. . According to police, prosecutors and Davis’ own accounts, he is the only person still alive among four people who were in a white Cadillac from which shots were fired in September 1996, mortally wounding Shakur and grazing rap mogul Marion “Suge” Knight at an intersection just off the Las Vegas Strip. Knight, now 59, is serving 28 years in a California prison for using a vehicle to kill a Los Angeles-area man in 2015.. Davis has publicly described himself as the orchestrator of the shooting, but not the gunman. A renewed push by Las Vegas police to solve the case led to a search warrant and raid last July at his home in Henderson.. Prosecutors say they have strong evidence to convict Davis of murder based his own accounts during multiple police and media interviews since 2008 — and in a 2019 memoir of his life leading a Compton street gang.. In his book, Davis wrote he was promised immunity to tell authorities in Los Angeles what he knew about the fatal shootings of Shakur and rival rapper Christopher Wallace six months later in Los Angeles. Wallace was known as The Notorious B.I.G. or Biggie Smalls.. Arnold maintains that Davis told stories so he could make money and that police and prosecutors in Nevada lack key evidence including the gun, the Cadillac and proof that Davis was in Las Vegas at the time of the shooting. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Israelis' lawsuit says UN agency helps Hamas by paying Gaza staff in dollars,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/israelis-lawsuit-agency-helps-hamas-paying-gaza-staff-111423112,2024-06-25 20:14:24,"Israelis who were taken hostage or lost loved ones during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack are suing the United Nations agency that aids Palestinians. NEW YORK -- Israelis who were taken hostage or lost loved ones during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack are suing the United Nations agency that aids Palestinians, claiming it has helped finance the militants by paying agency staffers in U.S. dollars and thereby funneling them to money-changers in Gaza who allegedly give a cut to Hamas.. But the agency, known as UNWRA, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the staffers were paid in dollars by their own choice. Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank don’t have their own national currency, and primarily use Israeli shekels.. The lawsuit, filed Monday in a U.S. federal court in New York, marks the latest challenge to the beleaguered U.N. agency, which has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war. The Israeli government has long assailed the over 70-year-old agency, and scrutiny has intensified during the eight-month-long war, prompting UNRWA to defend itself while grappling with a spiraling humanitarian crisis in Gaza. . “UNRWA’s staff, facilities and ability to truck cash U.S. dollars into Gaza formed a potent pillar of Hamas’ plan to undertake the Oct. 7 attack,” the lawsuit says, asserting that the U.N. agency “systematically and deliberately aided and abetted Hamas and its goals.”. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said Tuesday that he learned of the case only through the media. . “I don’t know what the status of this lawsuit is all about, but for the time being, I see this as an additional way to put pressure on the agency,” he said at a press briefing in Geneva.. UNRWA has denied that it knowingly aids Hamas or any other militant group. . Israel invaded Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, in which militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250. The war has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t say how many were civilians or fighters.. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of scores of Israelis including Oct. 7 attack survivors, victims' relatives, and rescued captives. It echoes some complaints their government has raised, ranging from claims that UNRWA employs Hamas operatives to complaints about the content of textbooks in UNRWA-run schools. . But the suit also focuses on the agency's practice of paying its 13,000 Gaza staffers in U.S. dollars. The money is wired from a bank in New York and trucked into Gaza, according to the legal complaint, which says the payroll totaled at least $20 million a month from 2018 until last September. . UNRWA employees use local money-changers to convert their dollars to Israeli shekels, the complaint says. . Some Palestinians also use dollars or Jordanian dinars, viewing them as stable and trusted currencies. . The suit claims that Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007, “runs the majority” of the currency exchangers and extracts a 10% to 25% fee from the rest, “ensuring that a predictable percentage of UNRWA’s payroll went to Hamas"" in dollars useful for black-market weapons deals. . “Hamas’ ability to carry out the Oct. 7 attack would have been significantly and possibly fatally weakened without that UNRWA-provided cash,” the complaint says. . The complaint points to an UNRWA-commissioned 2018 report about delivering aid in cash that noted risks of misappropriation, fraud or other diversion away from the intended purpose.. UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma said in a message to the AP that Gaza staffers asked that “they are paid in US$ because Gaza does not have an official national currency.”. Touma said the U.N., including UNRWA, and their officials are immune from lawsuits. She declined to comment further on the suit in question, saying the agency hadn’t officially been served with it. . One of the plaintiffs' lead lawyers, Gavi Mairone, said in a statement Tuesday that they didn't believe the U.N. and officials named in the suit had immunity, “and certainly not from these claims.”. Formally called the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA was established to help the estimated 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding the country’s creation. Their descendants now number nearly 6 million.. The agency operates schools, health clinics, infrastructure projects and aid programs in refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. . Since the war began in Gaza, over 1.7 million people have taken shelter in UNRWA facilities. At least 500 displaced people have been killed when such facilities came under attack, according to UNWRA statistics released Friday. The agency has lost nearly 200 staffers. . Two U.N. officials said Tuesday that the world body warned Israel that Gaza aid operations would be suspended unless protections for humanitarian workers improve. . Israel has accused UNRWA of letting Hamas exploit its aid and facilities, and Israel claimed this winter that a dozen UNRWA employees participated in the Oct. 7 attacks. . The allegations prompted the U.S. and more than a dozen other countries to suspend hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions to the agency, though all but the U.S. and Britain have resumed their funding. Lazzarini said Tuesday that new donors also have come on board, but the agency still faces a year-end shortfall of up to $140 million.. ___. El Deeb reported from Beirut.

EVAN GERSHKOVICH — The 32-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter faces trial Wednesday on espionage charges that he, his employer and the U.S. government deny. He was detained in March 2023 while reporting in the city of Yekaterinburg and accused of spying. Russia alleges Gershkovich was “gathering secret information” at the CIA's behest about a facility that produces and repairs military equipment. It provided no evidence to support the accusations..

His supporters say the woman made baseless claims of sexual abuse that already had been discredited by Texas investigators but he was convicted in Russia anyway and sentenced to prison.. Gershkovich and Whelan have gotten the most attention, with the State Department designating both as wrongfully detained. The designation is applied to only a small subset of Americans jailed by foreign countries.. Those cases go to a special State Department envoy for hostage affairs, who tries to negotiate their release. They must meet certain criteria, including a determination the arrest came solely because the person is a U.S. national or part of an effort to influence U.S. policy or extract concessions from the government.. The U.S. successfully negotiated swaps in 2022 for WNBA star Brittney Griner and Marine veteran Trevor Reed — both designated as wrongfully detained. Moscow got arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was serving a 25-year sentence, and pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, serving 20 years for cocaine trafficking.. It’s unclear how many Americans are jailed in Russia or if negotiations are in the works for them.. Kurmasheva’s husband, Pavel Butorin, told The Associated Press after her arrest he hoped the U.S. government would use “every avenue and every means available to it” to win her release, including designating her as wrongfully detained.. In December, the State Department said it had made a significant offer for Gershkovich and Whelan but Russia rejected it.. Officials did not give details, although Russia has been said to be seeking Vadim Krasikov, serving a life sentence in Germany in 2021 for the killing of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany.. President Vladimir Putin, asked about releasing Gershkovich, appeared to refer to Krasikov by pointing to a man imprisoned by a U.S. ally for “liquidating a bandit” who had allegedly killed Russian soldiers in Chechnya.. Beyond that, Russia has stayed silent. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says such swaps “must be carried out in absolute silence.”. Historically, when relations are better, ""the exchanges seem to be smoother,” said Nina Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School in New York and the great-granddaughter of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.. She cited prisoner swaps between the USSR and Chile in the 1970s, as well as those with the U.S. and Germany shortly after Mikhail Gorbachev took office in the 1980s involving dissidents Vladimir Bukovsky and Natan Sharansky.. Ultimately, the decision “is only in Putin’s hands,” Khrushcheva said.. In Gershkovich's case, an exchange might also involve concessions, possibly related to Ukraine, said Sam Greene of the Center for European Policy Analysis.. “Even if the immediate reason to get people around the (negotiating) table is Evan and a prisoner exchange, that allows them to get right up to the line and to say: ‘OK, we’ve got 98% of the deal, but if you really want to get this done, there’s this other thing we’d really like to talk about,’"" like sanctions or another Ukraine-related issue, he said. . “The Kremlin is perfectly happy to hold onto Evan as long as it possibly can. And so its incentive is to get as much for him as possible,” Greene said.. ___. Tucker reported from Washington.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

NEW YORK -- A Manhattan judge on Tuesday modified Donald Trump's gag order, freeing the former president to comment publicly about witnesses and jurors in the hush money criminal trial that led to his felony conviction, but keeping others connected to the case off limits until he is sentenced July 11.. Judge Juan M. Merchan’s decision — just days before Trump’s debate Thursday with President Joe Biden — clears the presumptive Republican nominee to again go on the attack against his lawyer-turned-foe lawyer Michael Cohen, porn actor Stormy Daniels and other trial witnesses. Trump was convicted in New York on May 30 of falsifying records to cover up a potential sex scandal, making him the first ex-president convicted of a crime.. In a five-page ruling, Merchan wrote that the gag order was meant to “protect the integrity of the judicial proceedings"" and that protections for witnesses and jurors no longer applied now that the trial has ended and the jury has been discharged.. Merchan said it had been his “strong preference” to continue barring Trump from commenting about jurors, whose names have not been made public, but that he couldn't justify doing so. The judge did leave in place a separate order prohibiting Trump and his lawyers from disclosing the identities of individual jurors or their addresses. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said after the verdict the defense team has destroyed that information.. “There is ample evidence to justify continued concern for the jurors,” Merchan wrote.. Merchan also left in place a ban on Trump commenting about court staffers, the prosecution team and their families until he is sentenced, writing that they must “continue to perform their lawful duties free from threats, intimidation, harassment, and harm.” Those restrictions do not prohibit Trump from commenting about the judge himself or District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office prosecuted the case.. Trump’s lawyers had urged Merchan to lift the gag order completely, arguing there was nothing to warrant restricting Trump’s First Amendment rights after the trial’s conclusion. Trump has said the gag order prevented him from defending himself while Cohen and Daniels continued to pillory him.. Though largely a win for Trump, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung criticized Tuesday's ruling as “another unlawful decision by a highly conflicted judge, which is blatantly un-American as it gags President Trump, the leading candidate in the 2024 Presidential Election during the upcoming Presidential Debate on Thursday.”. Cheung said Trump and his lawyers “will immediately challenge today’s unconstitutional order,"" arguing that portions of the gag order still in effect prevent him from speaking about the judge, whom he alleges had a conflict of interest, or repeating his unfounded claims that Biden directed the prosecution. . The Manhattan DA's office had asked Merchan to keep the gag order’s ban on comments about the jury and trial staff in place at least until Trump is sentenced, but said last week they would be OK allowing Trump to comment about witnesses now that the trial is over.. A message seeking comment was left with the Manhattan DA's office.. Cohen, who testified for four days against his ex-boss, reacted to the ruling via text message. He wrote: “For the past 6 years, Donald and acolytes have been making constant negative statements about me. Donald’s failed strategy of discrediting me so that he can avoid accountability didn’t work then and won’t work now.”. Daniels’ lawyer Clark Brewster said they “have nothing but respect” for Merchan and defer to his post-verdict review of the gag order “in the context of free speech and any continuing danger to the judicial process.”. “His decision to impose restrictions on Mr. Trump, as it related to reckless and unrelenting character attacks on court personnel, trial witnesses, and potentially jurors was extraordinary but clearly justified given the defendant’s uncontrollable daily rants,” Brewster said.. Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. She claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies.. The crime is punishable by up to four years behind bars, but prosecutors haven't said if they would seek incarceration and it’s unclear if Merchan would impose such a sentence. Other options include a fine or probation.. Following his conviction, Trump complained he was under a “nasty gag order,” while also testing its limits. In remarks a day after his conviction, Trump referred to Cohen as “a sleazebag,” though not by name. . In a subsequent Newsmax interview, Trump took issue with jury and its makeup, complaining about Manhattan, “It’s a very, very liberal democrat area so I knew we were in deep trouble,” and claiming: “I never saw a glimmer of a smile from the jury. No, this was a venue that was very unfair. A tiny fraction of the people are Republicans.”. Trump’s lawyers, who said they were under the impression the gag order would end with a verdict, wrote to Merchan on June 4 asking him to lift the order.. Prosecutors wanted Merchan to keep the gag order’s ban on comments about jurors and trial staff “at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.” They argued the judge had “an obligation to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice.”. Merchan issued Trump’s gag order on March 26, a few weeks before the start of the trial, after prosecutors raised concerns about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s propensity to assail people involved in his cases.. Merchan later expanded it to prohibit comments about his own family after Trump made social media posts attacking the judge’s daughter, a Democratic political consultant.. During the trial, Merchan held Trump in contempt of court, fined him $10,000 for violating the gag order and threatened to put him in jail if he did it again.. In seeking to lift the order, Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove argued that Trump was entitled to “unrestrained campaign advocacy” in light of Biden’s public comments about the verdict, and Cohen and Daniels ′ continued public criticism.. __.

abcnews.com,Town in Washington state to pay $15 million to parents of 13-year-old who drowned at summer camp,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/town-washington-state-pay-15-million-parents-13-111420252,2024-06-25 16:41:04,"A town in Washington state will pay the parents of a teen $15 million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit they filed after he drowned during a town summer camp outing. SEATTLE -- A town in Washington state will pay the parents of a teenage boy $15 million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit they filed after he drowned during a town summer camp outing. . Darrell “DJ” McCutcheon, Jr., disappeared under water in Florence Lake on Anderson Island southwest of Seattle on July 15, 2022, according to Pierce County Court records. . Brett Rosen, an attorney for the McCutcheon family, told The Seattle Times this week that Steilacoom agreed to pay $15 million to settle their lawsuit in late April.. A camp employee had left 13-year-old DJ and other teenagers at the lake that day while he went to pick up another group of children and a co-worker at the ferry station nearby, court records show. . DJ, who had never swum in open water before and was not given a life jacket, was underwater for about six minutes before bystanders rescued him and began performing CPR. He was flown to a hospital and died that day, court records said.. Earnest Roberts, who was walking on the beach at the time, swam out and spotted the 13-year-old about 10 feet (3 meters) under the water and pulled him to the surface. . “If he was adequately and property supervised as part of the summer camp group ... that boy would not have died,"" Roberts said, according to court records.. The boy's parents, Tamicia and Darrell McCutcheon Sr., sued the town for negligence.. “The most important thing for them is to never have this happen to another child,"" Rosen said. . Paul Loveless, Steilacoom’s administrator, and Amanda Kuehn, its attorney, declined to talk to the newspaper, citing ongoing litigation because final dismissal paperwork had not yet been filed. . In a January court filing, the town sought to dismiss the couple’s wrongful-death claim, saying Tamicia McCutcheon had signed a waiver accepting risks including injury or death from participating in activities in or near water. . The couple’s attorneys argued the “generic release” form did not describe any situations where the children would be taken to open water.. The McCutcheons’ attorneys also said that camp employees planned the outing knowing they would have to transport the campers from the ferry station in two groups, leaving one by the water. That decision violated a policy in the town’s staff training manual which said campers “must be under the supervision of a staff person at all times during program hours,” court records show.. The McCutcheons plan to use the settlement money to start a nonprofit dedicated to promoting summer camp aquatic safety and to create scholarships in their son’s name, Rosen said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Bill allowing doctor-assisted suicide approved by Delaware lawmakers,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/bill-allowing-doctor-assisted-suicide-approved-delaware-lawmakers-111422798,2024-06-25 18:38:00,"A bill allowing doctor-assisted suicide in Delaware has won final passage in the state Senate after failing to clear that chamber last week. DOVER, Del. -- A bill allowing doctor-assisted suicide in Delaware won final passage in the state Senate on Tuesday after failing to clear that chamber last week.. The measure, which now goes to Democratic Gov. John Carney, passed on an 11-10 vote after the Democrat-led Senate voted by that same margin to reconsider the legislation and rescind last week’s vote.. Sen. Kyra Hoffner, a Smyrna-area Democrat and co-sponsor of the bill, cast the deciding vote. On Thursday, after some fellow Democrats spoke passionately against the bill, she tearfully declined to vote on it.. “I’m sorry that I did not vote Thursday like I wanted to,” Hoffner said Tuesday, adding that she had time to reflect over the weekend and talk to both supporters and opponents of the bill. “It has been a very emotional weekend for me."". Lawmakers continued to air strong sentiments for and against the bill during Tuesday’s debate.. “How more despicable can we become?” asked GOP Sen. David Lawson, of Marydel.. Senate Minority Whip Brian Pettyjohn said assisted suicide suggests that “some lives are less worth living,” and is not supported by any major medical organization.. “Our response to suffering should not be to eliminate the sufferer,” said Pettyjohn, a Georgetown Republican. Pettyjohn said no major medical organization supports assisted-suicide.. Democrat Majority Leader Brian Townsend, of Newark, countered that assisted suicide is not about “eliminating” terminally ill patients, but “empowering” them. He also noted that the American Medical Association has taken a “neutral” position on assisted suicide, which has become a divisive issue within that organization, and that the Delaware Nurses Association supports the legislation.. As he did last week, Townsend noted that the vast majority of doctor-assisted suicides in other states involve people who are under hospice care. Currently, only 10 states, along with the District of Columbia, have laws legalizing doctor-assisted suicide. . There have been no documented cases of abuse or coercion involving doctor-assisted suicide since Oregon became the first state to allow it in 1997, according to Compassion & Choices, an advocacy group.. The Delaware bill passed each chamber of the General Assembly with only the bare majority of votes needed for passage. It is the latest iteration of legislation repeatedly introduced by Newark Democrat Rep. Paul Baumbach since 2015, and the only version to make it to a floor vote.. “This is an issue about allowing adults facing a terminal illness to make critical decisions about their last days,” Baumbach said in a statement released after Tuesday’s vote.. The legislation allows an adult resident of Delaware who is diagnosed with a terminal illness and expected to die within six months to request lethal prescription drugs from a doctor or advanced practice registered nurse who has primary responsibility for the terminal illness. A consulting physician or nurse would have to confirm the diagnosis and prognosis of the patient, who must have “decision-making capacity.”. The patient would have to be evaluated by a psychiatrist or a psychologist if any of the medical professionals was concerned that the patient lacks decision-making capacity. A person also would not qualify for doctor-assisted suicide solely because of age or disability.. The patient would have to make two oral requests for a lethal prescription, followed by a written request, and would have to wait at least 15 days after the initial request before receiving and self-administering the drugs. The attending doctor or nurse would have to wait at least 48 hours after the written request, which must be signed by two witnesses, before prescribing the drugs.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

DETROIT -- A judge on Tuesday blocked Michigan's 24-hour waiting period for abortions, saying it conflicts with a 2022 voter-approved amendment to the state constitution that guarantees abortion rights.. The waiting period “forces needless delay on patients after they are able to consent to a procedure, thus burdening and infringing upon a patient’s access to abortion care,” said Judge Sima Patel of the Court of Claims.. Patel issued a preliminary injunction against the waiting period, which has been in place for years, and also blocked portions of state law that require abortion providers give information about adoption and depictions of the fetus.. The judge also stopped Michigan's requirement that only a physician can perform an abortion, noting that it excluded qualified nurses, physician assistants and nurse midwives. . “This exacerbates existing provider shortages, leading to large swathes of Michigan that currently lack physicians to provide abortion care,” Patel said.. The lawsuit was filed by Northland Family Planning Centers and a group called Medical Students for Choice. The legal challenge will continue while the injunction is in place.. State attorneys who had to defend the laws said a waiting period simply gave someone time to reflect on a major decision. . Abortion rights were added to the state constitution by nearly 57% of voters in 2022, months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer praised the injunction.. “By removing these barriers to reproductive health care, we will ensure Michigan is a state where you can make the medical decisions that are best for you and your family in consultation with your doctor,"" Whitmer said.. ___.

abcnews.com,List of missing residents shrinks as New Mexico village seeks recovery from wildfires,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/team-combs-fire-ravaged-new-mexico-community-remains-111392983,2024-06-25 17:42:25,"Search and rescue crews have been able to trimdown the list of residents unaccounted for after people fled from a New Mexico mountain village from a pair of fast-moving wildfires. The number of residents still unaccounted for has been shrinking significantly after thousands of people fled their homes as two fast-moving wildfires approached their village in southern New Mexico, Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford said Tuesday. . Search and rescue crews have cleared more properties in the areas of Ruidoso, the mountain community hardest hit by the flames, and village officials and volunteers from the American Red Cross have been working through social media to list all those found to be “safe.”. Just a few people remained on the list Tuesday as unaccounted for. They include those authorities have yet to make contact with and who have not been heard from by family and friends. . Crawford said during his regular radio address that he hoped to get the list down to zero. . “We feel good that we're getting that number down ... but we have to be sure,” he said.. About 1,000 firefighters were assigned to the fires in Ruidoso, as other crews were busy responding to reports of new fires around the region. In all, more than 100 new fires — most of them small — were reported in New Mexico and Arizona over the last seven days, according to the multiagency Southwest Coordination Center based in Albuquerque.. Federal officials have been working to streamline their response to major wildfires, starting with the deployment of complex incident management teams when there are significant threats to homes and infrastructure. That was the case with the fires in Ruidoso, which has a permanent population of about 8,000 and can triple during the summer months when tourists flood in. . Nationwide, more than a dozen large uncontained fires are currently burning, according to the National Interagecy Fire Center. Aside from the South Fork and Salt fires in Ruidoso, complex incident management teams are assigned to blazes in Washington and Colorado.. With more streets in Ruidoso being cleared by the special teams and their search dogs, village officials were able to open up more areas of the village on Tuesday. Some areas that have yet to be searched and spots where post-fire flooding remain a concern remained off limits. . Firefighters were helped over recent days by rainfall, cooler temperatures and high humidity levels. They have been focused on pockets of unburned fuel to ensure no flare-ups with drier weather expected over the next two days.. The fires were first reported June 17. Within hours, flames moved through tinder-dry parts of the Sacramento Mountains from Mescalero Apache tribal land toward Ruidoso. Evacuation orders included thousands of homes, businesses and the Ruidoso Downs horse track, prompting traffic jams as people dropped everything and fled.. About 40 square miles were charred before crews were able to corral the flames. At least two deaths have been confirmed, and an estimated 1,500 structures have been destroyed or damaged.. The FBI is investigating, offering up to $10,000 for information leading to the arrests and convictions of those responsible for the human-caused fires.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

FERNANDINA BEACH, Fla. -- An online gaming dispute made its way to the real world when a New Jersey man flew to Florida to attack another player with a hammer, authorities said.. Edward Kang, 20, is charged with attempted second-degree murder and armed burglary with a mask, according to Nassau County court records. He was arrested early Sunday morning.. “I just want to let you know, this is a weird one,"" Nassau County Sheriff Bill Leeper said during a news conference on Monday. ""Some things you just can’t make up.”. Kang and the victim, another young man around the same age as Kang, had never met in real life, but they both played ArcheAge, a medieval fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Leeper said. The game's publisher announced in April that it would be shutting down servers in Europe and North America on June 27, citing a declining number of active players.. Kang flew from Newark, New Jersey, to Jacksonville, Florida, last Thursday after telling his mother that he was going to visit a friend that he had met while playing a video game, officials said. Officials didn’t say how Kang learned where the victim lives. Upon arrival, Kang took an Uber to a hotel in Fernandina Beach, about 35 miles north of Jacksonville, and then bought a hammer at a local hardware store, deputies said.. Kang went to the victim's Fernandina Beach home, which was unlocked, around 2 a.m. Sunday, authorities said. The victim was walking out of his bedroom when he was confronted by Kang, who hit him on the head with the hammer, officials said. The two struggled as the victim called for help. His stepfather responded and helped to restrain Kang until police arrived.. The victim suffered several head wounds that were not considered life-threatening, officials said. He received staples at the hospital.. Once in custody, Kang told investigators that the victim is a “bad person online,” officials said. He also asked deputies how much jail time people got for breaking and entering and assault.. “I would say Mr. Kang, it's going to be a long time before you play video games again,"" Leeper said..

DEDHAM, Mass. -- The fate of Karen Read was handed Tuesday to jurors who must decide whether she ended a rocky romance by angrily striking her boyfriend with her SUV and leaving him mortally injured in the snow, or is a victim of police corruption, framed to cover up a fight at the home of his fellow Boston officer.. Jurors got to work after a two-month murder trial in the death of Boston officer John O’Keefe in January 2022. The case has drawn outsized attention, fanned by true crime bloggers and Read’s pink-shirted supporters.. Defense lawyer Alan Jackson described a cancer of lies that turned into a cover-up, and told jurors they’re the “only thing standing between Karen Read and the tyranny of injustice.”. “You have been lied to in this courtroom. Your job is to make sure you don’t ever ever look the other way,” he said Tuesday.. But Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally told jurors “there is no conspiracy.” He began his closing argument with the words four witnesses reported hearing Read say after O’Keefe was discovered on the snowy lawn: “The defendant repeatedly said ‘I hit him. I hit him. Oh my God. I hit him.’”. “Those were the words that came from the defendant’s mouth,” Lally said.. Read, a former adjunct professor at Bentley College, is charged with second-degree murder, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, along with manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving a scene of personal injury and death. The manslaughter charge carries a penalty of five to 20 years in prison, and the other charge has a maximum penalty of 10 years.. Her lawyers contend O’Keefe was dragged outside after he was beaten up in the basement and bitten by a dog at Boston officer Brian Albert’s home in Canton.. “Ladies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,” Jackson said.. Lally, however, showed the jurors what Read herself said that night, in a voice message she left for O’Keefe moments after her car recorded her driving in reverse at approximately 24 mph (39 kph) and then leaving the scene: He said she was “seething in rage as she’s screaming, ‘John, I (expletive) hate you!’”. The defense said witnesses who claimed to have heard her say she hit O’Keefe had changed their story or couldn’t have heard her comments in the chaos of that moment. Jackson said investigators focused on Read because she was a “convenient outsider” who saved them from having to consider other suspects, including Albert and other law enforcement officers at the house party. He also pointed to connections between Albert and the state trooper who led the investigation.. “Michael Proctor didn’t draw a thin blue line, he erected a tall blue wall,” Jackson said. “A wall that you can’t scale, a wall that Karen Read certainly couldn’t get over. A wall between us and them. A place you folk are not invited. ‘We protect our own.’”. Jackson suggested that Brian Higgins, a federal agent who had exchanged flirty texts with Read, lured O’Keefe to the house party, where the two got into a fight, leading to punches and a fall.. “The panic sets in,” he said. “It wasn’t intended to go that far but what is done is done.”. Prosecutors spent most of the trial methodically presenting evidence from the scene. The defense called only a handful of witnesses but used its time in cross-examining prosecution witnesses to raise questions about the investigation, echoed by a chorus of supporters outside.. —-.

abcnews.com,FDA warns maker of Sara Lee and Entenmann's not to claim foods contain allergens when they don't,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/fda-warns-maker-sara-lee-entenmanns-claim-foods-111422784,2024-06-25 19:34:22,"Federal food safety regulators are warning Bimbo Bakeries USA to stop using misleading labels that say products contain potentially dangerous allergens when they don't. Federal food safety regulators said Tuesday that they have warned a top U.S. bakery to stop using labels that say its products contain potentially dangerous allergens when they don't. . U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspectors found that Bimbo Bakeries USA — which includes brands such as Sara Lee, Oroweat, Thomas', Entenmann's and Ball Park buns and rolls — listed ingredients such as sesame or tree nuts on labels even when they weren't in the foods. . Under FDA regulations, such products are “misbranded,"" FDA officials said in a warning letter sent to officials at the company’s Horsham, Pennsylvania, headquarters earlier this month.. “Food labels must be truthful and not misleading,” officials said. The warning followed inspections late last year at Bimbo plants in Phoenix, Arizona, and Topeka, Kansas, that make Sara Lee and Brownberry breads. . In addition, FDA officials indicated that allergen labeling is a “not a substitute” for preventing cross-contamination in factories. . Advocates with the nonprofit group FARE, Food Allergy Research & Education, said such labeling “does a disservice” to the estimated 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies. Those consumers have to be constantly aware of foods that can cause potentially life-threatening allergic reactions, said Sung Poblete, FARE's chief executive. . “Our community relies on accurate product labeling for their health and safety,” Poblette said in an email. “These findings about Bimbo Bakeries’ products undermine their trust and further limit their choices.”. Bimbo, a Mexico City-based food giant, bills its U.S. operations as the largest commercial baking company in the country. In an email, company officials said they “take their role in protecting consumers with allergen sensitivities very seriously” and that they are corresponding with FDA to resolve the issue. . Concerns over labels at Bimbo and other companies followed a law that took effect in 2022, which added sesame to the list of major allergens that must be listed on packaging. . Because it can be difficult and expensive to keep sesame in one part of a baking plant out of another, some companies began adding small amounts of sesame to products that didn't previously contain the ingredient to avoid liability and cost. FDA officials said that violated the spirit, but not the letter, of federal regulations.. Some companies, including Bimbo, began listing allergens such as sesame on labels as a “precaution” in case of cross-contamination. . FDA officials acknowledged Tuesday that statements that a product “may contain” certain allergens “could be considered truthful and not misleading.” Bimbo officials have until July 8 to identify steps taken to remedy the issue — or to explain why the labeling doesn't violate FDA standards. . ___.

abcnews.com,US surgeon general declares gun violence a public health emergency,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-surgeon-general-declares-gun-violence-public-health-111395244,2024-06-25 21:42:23,"The U.S. surgeon general is declaring gun violence a public health crisis, driven by a growing number of injuries and deaths involving firearms in the country. WASHINGTON -- The U.S. surgeon general on Tuesday declared gun violence a public health crisis, driven by the fast-growing number of injuries and deaths involving firearms in the country. . The advisory issued by Dr. Vivek Murthy, the nation's top doctor, came as the U.S. grappled with another summer weekend marked by mass shootings that left dozens of people dead or wounded. . “People want to be able to walk through their neighborhoods and be safe,"" Murthy told The Associated Press in a phone interview. “America should be a place where all of us can go to school, go to work, go to the supermarket, go to our house of worship, without having to worry that that's going to put our life at risk.” . To drive down gun deaths, Murthy calls on the U.S. to ban automatic rifles, introduce universal background checks for purchasing guns, regulate the industry, pass laws that would restrict their use in public spaces and penalize people who fail to safely store their weapons. . None of those suggestions can be implemented nationwide without legislation passed by Congress, which typically recoils at gun control measures. Some state legislatures, however, have enacted or may consider some of the surgeon general's proposals.. Surgeon General Murthy said there is “broad agreement” that gun violence is a problem, citing a poll last year that found most Americans worry at least sometimes that a loved one might be injured by a firearm. More than 48,000 Americans died from gun injuries in 2022. . Doctors quickly praised Murthy's advisory. The American Academy of Family Physicians, for example, has considered gun violence a public health epidemic for over a decade. . “Family physicians have long understood, and have seen first hand, the devastating impact firearm violence has on our patients and the communities we serve,” the group's president, Steven Furr, said in a statement. . Murthy's advisory, however, promises to be controversial with the gun lobby and will certainly incense Republican lawmakers, most of whom opposed his confirmation — twice — to the job over his statements on gun violence. . The National Rifle Association promptly rebuked Murthy's advisory. . “This is an extension of the Biden Administration's war on law-abiding gun owners,” Randy Kozuch, the organization's president, said in a statement on X. . It was the NRA, and Republicans who enjoy the powerful gun lobby's support, that almost derailed Murthy's confirmation as surgeon general a decade ago. Murthy became quieter on the issue of gun violence after his past statements almost cost him the job. He ended up promising the Senate that he did “not intend to use my office as surgeon general as a bully pulpit on gun control.” . Then-President Donald Trump dismissed Murthy in 2017, but President Joe Biden nominated him again to the position in 2021. . Murthy has published warnings about troubling health trends in American life, including loneliness and social media use. In an opinion piece in The New York Times this month, he said social media has contributed to a mental health crisis among the country's young people and asked Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms similar to those on cigarette boxes.. But he also has faced mounting pressure from some doctors and Democratic advocacy groups to speak out more. A group of four former surgeon generals asked the Biden administration to produce a report on the problem in 2022. . “It is now time for us to take this issue out of the realm of politics and put it in the realm of public health, the way we did with smoking more than a half century ago,” Murthy told the AP. . It was a 1964 report from the surgeon general that raised awareness about the dangers of smoking is largely credited with reducing tobacco use and precipitating regulations on the industry. . Murthy now hopes his advisory on guns will shift the conversation, too, on this issue. He has been encouraged by some developments in Congress, including the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in 2022 that enhanced background checks for firearms. . A White House report obtained by The Associated Press says that more thorough background checks have stopped roughly 800 sales of firearms to people under age 21. Additionally, more than 500 people, including some linked to transnational cartels and organized crime rings, have been charged with gun trafficking and other crimes under the landmark gun safety legislation. . Children and younger Americans, in particular, are suffering from gun violence, Murthy notes in his advisory called “Firearm Violence: A Public Health Crisis in America.” Suicide by gun rates have increased by nearly 70% for those between the ages of 10 to 14. Children in the U.S. are far more likely to die from gun wounds than children in other countries, the research he gathered shows. . For pediatricians, talking with families about locking up their guns away from their children has become a routine part of well visits, said Benjamin Hoffman, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. When children can't get access to a gun, it prevents a large chunk of gun deaths and injuries — accidental shootings and suicides. . “Having access to a firearm for a child who is experiencing a behavioral health crisis is an absolute recipe for the most tragic things you can imagine,” Hoffman said. . Even when children are not direct victims of a gun shooting, they may suffer from mental health blowback of gun violence, the report says. About half of teens in the U.S. worry about a school shooting. And in areas that have been exposed to a fatal shooting at a school, youth antidepressant use jumps by more than 20%. . In addition to new regulations, Murthy calls for an increase in gun violence research and for the health system to promote and educate patients about gun safety and proper storage during checkups. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Alec Baldwin attorneys argue damage to gun during testing was unacceptable destruction of evidence,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/alec-baldwin-attorneys-argue-damage-gun-testing-unacceptable-111392706,2024-06-25 01:02:42,"Defense attorneys for Alec Baldwin say the involuntary manslaughter charge against him in the 2021 death of a cinematographer on a movie set should be thrown out because the gun was damaged during FBI testing. SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Alec Baldwin's defense attorneys argued Monday that damage done during FBI testing to a revolver that killed a cinematographer on the set of the Western “Rust” has stripped them of the ability to put on a proper defense at the actor's forthcoming trial, and asked a New Mexico judge to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter charge against him. . ""They understood that this was potentially exculpatory evidence and they destroyed it anyway,"" Baldwin lawyer John Bash said during a virtual court hearing. “It’s outrageous and it requires dismissal.” . Prosecutors argued that the gun breaking into pieces during testing was “unfortunate” but that Baldwin's team still has plenty of evidence for a defense and did not meet their burden for having the case thrown out. . Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said she expects to issue a ruling on the motion to dismiss on Friday. . During the fatal rehearsal on Oct. 21, 2021, Baldwin was pointing the gun at Halyna Hutchins on a movie-set ranch when it went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza, who survived. . Sheriff's investigators initially sent the revolver to the FBI only for DNA testing, but when an FBI analyst heard Baldwin say in an ABC TV interview in December that he never pulled the trigger, the agency told the local authorities they could conduct an accidental discharge test. . The FBI was told to go ahead, and tested the revolver by striking it from several angles with a rawhide mallet. One of those strikes caused the gun to break into three pieces. . The FBI had made police and prosecutors aware that the test could do major damage to the gun, which hadn't been tested by the defense, but the authorities went ahead with the test without bothering to disassemble it and photograph its parts first, thus eliminating their most critical evidence in the case, Baldwin's lawyers argued. . “We can never use our own expert to examine that firearm,” Bash said. . The prosecution argued that the gun was not destroyed as the defense said.. “The parts are still available,” special prosecutor Erlinda Johnson said. ""The fact that this gun was unfortunately damaged does not deprive the defendant of ability to question the evidence."" . But Baldwin's lawyers said the damage done to the top notch on the revolver's hammer rendered the most important testing impossible. . They argued that if Marlowe Sommer declined to throw out the case, she should at least not allow any of the technical gun analysis to be presented at trial. . Baldwin's attorneys gave long and probing cross-examinations to the lead detective, an FBI forensic firearm investigator and the prosecution's independent gun expert in testimony that was likely a dress rehearsal for the high profile trial, where Baldwin, who was not on the online hearing, will be appearing in person. . The special prosecutors running the case argued that those cross-examinations proved that the defense has plenty of gun evidence to work with at the trial. . “They have other reasonable available means to making their point,” Johnson said. . She added that all available evidence, from witness testimony to video of Baldwin firing the gun in movie footage, showed that the gun was in good working order on the day of the shooting, and that police had no reason to believe its internal workings could provide exonerating evidence.. Prosecutors plan to present evidence at trial that they say shows the firearm “could not have fired absent a pull of the trigger” and was working properly before the shooting. . Defense attorneys are highlighting a previously undisclosed expert analysis that outlines uncertainty about the origin of toolmarks on the gun’s firing mechanism.. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to the involuntary manslaughter charge, which carries a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison. . Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was convicted in March of involuntary manslaughter for her role in the shooting and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.. On Friday, the judge denied prosecutors’ request to use immunity to compel testimony from Gutierrez-Reed at Baldwin’s trial. Her statements to investigators and workplace safety regulators will likely feature prominently in Baldwin’s trial.. Last year, special prosecutors dismissed an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin, saying they were informed the gun might have been modified before the shooting and malfunctioned. But they pivoted after receiving a new analysis of the gun and successfully pursued a grand jury indictment.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

DETROIT -- Ford is recalling more than 550,000 pickup trucks in the U.S. because the transmissions can unexpectedly downshift to first gear no matter how fast the trucks are going.. The recall covers certain F-150 pickups from the 2014 model year. Ford's F-Series pickups are the top-selling vehicles in the U.S. . Ford says in documents posted Tuesday by U.S. safety regulators that the downshifting can cause drivers to lose control of the trucks, increasing the risk of a crash.. The recalls come after U.S. auto safety regulators in March began investigating complaints that more than 540,000 Ford pickup trucks from 2014 can abruptly downshift to a lower gear and increase the risk of a crash.. Documents say the problem is caused by a lost signal between a transmission speed sensor and the powertrain control computer. There also could be corrosion and problems with connector pins.. Dealers will update the powertrain control software at no cost to owners, who will be notified by letters in early July.. In a statement Tuesday, Ford said it expects repairs to be available in the third quarter of this year. Owners will be able to use mobile service or pickup and delivery at participating dealers.. Ford says in documents posted Tuesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it has 396 warranty and field reports and 124 customer complaints about the problem, covering 482 trucks. . The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker says it knows of 130 complaints to the government, with 52 alleging that rear wheels locked up or that drivers lost control of the trucks. Two of the complainants reported injuries and one reported a crash that could have been caused by the problem, Ford said.. Ford's statement said that before the trucks downshift, drivers could see a malfunction indicator light on the dashboard. In some cases, signals can be restored while the trucks are moving, and they can be driven normally. In other cases drivers may need to stop and restart the engine to get the transmissions to work properly.. The company says it expects fewer than 1% of the recalled vehicles to have the problem.. NHTSA said it started its investigation in March after getting complaints about sudden downshifts in the trucks’ automatic transmissions.. The agency is looking into whether those trucks should have been included in previous recalls for the problem.. Ford started recalling trucks and other vehicles from the 2011 and 2012 model years in 2016, and added two recalls in 2019 covering pickups from the 2011 to 2013 model years. The recalls covered about 1.5 million vehicles.. The company said it’s working with NHTSA to support the investigation. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

abcnews.com,Israeli supreme court says ultra-Orthodox must serve in military,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israeli-supreme-court-ultra-orthodox-serve-military-111394436,2024-06-25 12:54:19,"Israel’s Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that the military must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox men for military service, a decision that could lead to the collapse of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition as Israel continues to wag.... JERUSALEM -- Israel’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled unanimously that the military must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox men for compulsory service, a landmark decision that could lead to the collapse of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition as Israel continues to wage war in Gaza.. The historic ruling effectively puts an end to a decades-old system that granted ultra-Orthodox men broad exemptions from military service while maintaining mandatory enlistment for the country’s secular Jewish majority. The arrangement, deemed discriminatory by critics, has created a deep chasm in Israel's Jewish majority over who should shoulder the burden of protecting the country.. The court struck down a law that codified exemptions in 2017, but repeated court extensions and government delaying tactics over a replacement dragged out a resolution for years. The court ruled that in the absence of a law, Israel’s compulsory military service applies to the ultra-Orthodox like any other citizen.. Under longstanding arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men have been exempt from the draft, which is compulsory for most Jewish men and women, who serve three and two years respectively as well as reserve duty until around age 40. . These exemptions have long been a source of anger among the secular public, a divide that has widened during the eight-month-old war, as the military has called up tens of thousands of soldiers and says it needs all the manpower it can get. Over 600 soldiers have been killed since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.. Politically powerful ultra-Orthodox parties, key partners in Netanyahu’s governing coalition, oppose any change to the current system. If the exemptions are ended, they could bolt the coalition, causing the government to collapse and likely leading to new elections at a time when its popularity has dropped.. In the current environment, Netanyahu could have a hard time delaying the matter any further or passing laws to restore the exemptions. During arguments, government lawyers told the court that forcing ultra-Orthodox men to enlist would “tear Israeli society apart.” . The ultra-Orthodox see their full-time religious study as their part in protecting the state. Many fear that greater contact with secular society through the military will distance adherents from strict observance of the faith.. A statement from Netanyahu’s Likud party criticized the ruling, saying a bill in parliament backed by the Israeli leader would address the draft issue. Critics say it falls short of Israel’s wartime needs.. “The real solution to the draft problem is not a Supreme Court ruling,” the statement said.. In its ruling, the court found that the state was carrying out “invalid selective enforcement, which represents a serious violation of the rule of law, and the principle according to which all individuals are equal before the law.”. It did not say how many ultra-Orthodox should be drafted, but the military has said it is capable of enlisting 3,000 this year.. The security establishment must “act immediately to implement the ruling"" and enlist at least that many ultra-Orthodox soldiers in the coming year, the Attorney General’s Office demanded in a letter to legal advisors for the defense establishment, the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of Education.. Some 66,000 ultra-Orthodox men are now eligible for enlistment, according to Shuki Friedman, an expert on religion and state affairs and the vice-president of the Jewish People Policy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank. . The ruling of Israel's highest court must be followed, and the military is expected to begin doing so once it forms a plan for how to draft thousands of members of a population that's deeply opposed to service, and which follows a cloistered and modest lifestyle the military may not be immediately prepared to accommodate. The army had no immediate comment.. The court also ruled that state subsidies for seminaries where exempted ultra-Orthodox men study should remain suspended. The court temporarily froze the seminary budgets earlier this year.. In a post on the social platform X, Cabinet minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, who heads one of the ultra-Orthodox parties in the coalition, called the ruling “very unfortunate and disappointing.” He did not say whether his party would bolt the government.. Israel's ultra-Orthodox make up roughly 13% of the 9.9 million population. The community has a high birthrate, making it the fastest-growing segment of the population, at about 4% annually. Each year, roughly 13,000 ultra-Orthodox males reach the conscription age of 18 but less than 10% enlist, according to the Israeli parliament’s State Control Committee.. Ultra-Orthodox men attend special seminaries that focus on religious studies, with little attention on secular topics such as math, English or science. Critics have said they are ill-prepared to serve in the military or enter the secular work force.. Religious women generally receive exemptions that are not as controversial, in part because women are not expected to serve in combat units. . The court ruling does not address the status of Israel's Palestinian citizens, who are not expected to serve and most of whom do not. As descendants of Palestinians who remained in Israel after the 1948 war that led to its creation, their ties to the military are fraught and some in Israel see them as a fifth column because of their solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.. Tuesday's ruling now sets the stage for growing friction within the coalition over the draft issue. Ultra-Orthodox lawmakers are likely to face intense pressure from religious leaders and their constituents and may have to decide whether remaining in the government is worthwhile for them. Previous court rulings on the issue and threats of enlistment have sparked protests and violence between the ultra-Orthodox and police.. Friedman said the ultra-Orthodox “understand that they don’t have a better political alternative, but at the same time their public is saying ‘why did we vote for you?’”. The exemptions have faced years of legal challenges and a string of court decisions has found the system unjust. But Israeli leaders, under pressure from ultra-Orthodox parties, have repeatedly stalled.. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, which has helped lead the challenge against the exemptions, called on the government to immediately draft all eligible seminary students. “This is their legal and moral duty, especially in light of the complex security situation and the urgent need for personnel” in the army, said Tomer Naor, head of the group's legal department.. Netanyahu’s coalition is buoyed by two ultra-Orthodox parties who oppose increasing enlistment for their constituents. The long-serving Israeli leader has tried to adhere to the court’s rulings while also scrambling to preserve his coalition. But with a slim majority of 64 seats in the 120-member parliament, he’s often beholden to the smaller parties.. The government could try to draft a law that restores the exemptions, but doing so would be politically challenging in light of the court's ruling. . Some moderate members of the government have indicated they will only support a law that enlists sizable numbers of ultra-Orthodox, and the legislative clock is running out with the Knesset soon to leave for summer recess. That could force the military to begin drafting religious men before any new law is in place.. Netanyahu has been promoting a bill tabled by a previous government in 2022 that sought to address the issue by calling for limited ultra-Orthodox enlistment. . But critics say that bill was crafted before the war and doesn’t do enough to address a pressing manpower shortfall as the army seeks to maintain its forces in the Gaza Strip while also preparing for potential war with the Lebanese Hezbollah group, which has been fighting with Israel since the war in Gaza erupted last October.. ___.

abcnews.com,UN tells Israel it will suspend aid operations across Gaza without improved safety,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/tells-israel-suspend-aid-operations-gaza-improved-safety-111406945,2024-06-25 16:22:17,"Senior U.N. officials have told Israel they'll suspend aid operations across Gaza unless urgent steps are taken to better protect humanitarian workers. WASHINGTON -- Senior U.N. officials have warned Israel that they will suspend the world body's aid operations across Gaza unless Israel acts urgently to better protect humanitarian workers, two U.N. officials said Tuesday. The ultimatum is the latest in a series of U.N. steps demanding Israel do more to safeguard aid operations from strikes by its forces and to curb growing lawlessness hindering humanitarian workers.. A U.N. letter sent to Israeli officials this month said Israel must provide U.N. workers with a way to communicate directly with Israeli forces on the ground in Gaza, among other steps, the officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations with Israeli officials. . The U.N. officials said there has been no final decision on suspending operations across Gaza and that talks with the Israelis were ongoing.. U.N. spokesman Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York that U.N. humanitarian coordinator Muhannad Hadi had written to the Israeli military on June 17 and the U.N.’s undersecretary for security, Gilles Michaud, spoke with Israeli military officials Monday.. Dujarric called conditions for aid workers in the territory “increasingly intolerable.” But he said the U.N. was “pushing all its contacts” with the Israelis to resolve the problems and noted that “the U.N. will not turn its back on the people of Gaza.”. U.S. officials are talking with the U.N. and Israeli military to try to help resolve U.N. concerns, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters Tuesday. Asked if the U.S. had received any commitments from Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who is visiting this week to speak with Biden administration officials, Miller said, “we went through a number of specific things that we want to see resolved when it comes to the humanitarian situation and got an assurance to continue to work on those."". The Israeli army declined to comment on the U.N. warning, and the Israeli defense ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The army claims it is trying to facilitate aid shipments and accuses Hamas of disrupting them, noting Tuesday that the militant group fired a projectile at the humanitarian route near a UNICEF aid convoy.. Israel has previously acknowledged some military strikes on humanitarian workers, including an April attack that killed seven workers with the World Central Kitchen, and has denied allegations of others.. Citing security concerns, the U.N. World Food Program has already suspended aid delivery from a U.S.-built pier designed to bring food and other emergency supplies to Palestinians who are facing starvation amid more than eight months of war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.. U.N. and other aid officials have complained for months that they have no way to communicate quickly and directly with Israeli forces on the ground, in contrast with the usual procedures — known as “deconfliction” — employed in conflict zones globally to protect aid workers from attack by combatants. Relief groups say Israel's procedure for coordinating aid work requires them to speak instead with an agency within the military.. In its letter to Israeli officials, the U.N. cited communication and protective equipment for aid workers as among the commitments that it wanted Israel to make good on for its aid operations in Gaza to continue, the two U.N. officials say.. Miller said taking aid from trucks and other criminal attacks were the biggest problems blocking aid delivery within Gaza right now, rather than strikes on aid workers by Israeli forces or commandeering of aid convoys by Hamas. . “And so we have been working with the U.N. and Israel to try to find a solution to that problem,” including trying to ensure that aid workers “have radios and other communications equipment so they can communicate with each other and safely move around Gaza,"" Miller told reporters.. The U.N. and other humanitarian organizations also complain of increasing crime in Gaza and have urged Israel to do more to improve overall security from attack and theft. The lawlessness has stymied what Israel said was a daily pause in fighting to allow aid into southern Gaza, with humanitarian officials saying groups of gunmen are regularly blocking convoys, holding drivers at gunpoint and rifling through their cargo.. On top of that, “missiles hit our premises, despite being deconflicted,” said Steve Taravella, a spokesman for the World Food Program, one of the main organizations working on humanitarian delivery in Gaza. He was not one of those confirming the U.N. threat to suspend operations across the territory. “WFP warehouses have been caught in the crossfire twice in the past two weeks.”. Humanitarian officials said conditions for civilians and aid workers have worsened since early May, when Israel launched an offensive in the southern city of Rafah, where many aid groups had their base. The operation has crippled what had been a main border crossing for food and other aid.. Aid workers trying to get shipments through the main remaining crossing, Kerem Shalom, face risks from fighting, damaged roads, unexploded ordnance and Israeli restrictions, including spending five or more hours a day waiting at checkpoints, Taravella said. . “Restoring order is crucial for an effective humanitarian response to meet soaring needs. U.N. agencies and others need a safe environment to be able to access people and scale up,” he said.. Israeli officials say the problems at Kerem Shalom are a matter of poor U.N. logistics.. Separately, the United Nations has suspended cooperation with the U.S.-built pier since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians.. While U.S. and Israeli officials said no part of the pier itself was used in the raid that rescued four hostages taken by Hamas, U.N. officials said any perception in Gaza that the project was used in the Israeli military operation may endanger their aid work.. The U.N. has finished a security assessment of the pier operation following the raid but has not yet made a decision on resuming delivery of supplies arriving by sea, according to a humanitarian official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that have not yet been released publicly.. Speaking to reporters traveling with a U.S. delegation to a gathering of defense chiefs in Botswana on Tuesday, an official with the U.S. Agency for International Development expressed optimism that aid deliveries from the pier would eventually resume. . “I think it’s a question of when the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) can provide, and the government of Israel can provide, the assurances that the U.N. is seeking on deconfliction and security right now,” said Isobel Coleman, deputy administrator of USAID, which has been working with the World Food Program on aid distribution from the pier.. ___.

One person has died and scores more remain hospitalized in Russia in an outbreak of botulism that spans several Russian regions, the authorities have reported. . Foodborne botulism is a rare illness caused by a toxin produced by a type of bacteria called Clostridium botulinum. Eating foods contaminated with the toxin can cause paralysis, breathing difficulties and sometimes death. Improperly canned, preserved or fermented foods are common sources. . Symptoms typical of botulism can include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, blurred vision, a dry mouth, difficulty in swallowing or speaking, and neurological symptoms.. More than 300 people have been hospitalized with botulism in Russia in a fairly big outbreak. The U.S. on average records 110 cases of botulism a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and only 82 cases were recorded in the European Union in 2021, a 2023 report by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control says. . Russian authorities blame the outbreak on ready-to-eat salads that contained canned beans and were made by a popular delivery service. Since mid-June, officials in Moscow, the outlying Moscow region, Nizhny Novgorod and Kazan have been reporting cases of botulism. . On Monday, an aide to Russia’s Health Minister Alexei Kuznetsov reported that a total of 369 people have been hospitalized with symptoms of botulism. Kuznetsov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that 218 people remained in the hospital as of Monday, including 38 people on ventilators, while 151 people have been discharged. . A 21-year-old man died in a hospital in the city of Kostroma, local officials reported Monday. According to the authorities, the man had traveled to Nizhny Novgorod, roughly 250 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of Kostroma, to visit relatives and ordered the salad with beans there. . Health officials initially linked at least some of the cases in Moscow to two brands of ready-made salads. Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's public health agency, halted the sale of the salads pending investigation after the first cases of poisoning were reported. . Within days, the authorities named one of the two salads as the culprit — the one made and sold by popular delivery service Kukhnya Na Rayone, which operates in Moscow, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and several other cities. Kukhnya Na Rayone has suspended operations, saying in an online statement that it no longer offered the salad with canned beans in it, and would check its other products as well. . A criminal investigation has been launched on the charges of making and distributing products in violation of safety standards. The authorities detained two top managers of Kukhnya Na Rayone, as well as the head of a company that makes canned beans and a man who worked as a cook there. The cook was placed in custody pending investigation and trial, while the three others were put under house arrest. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,UN-backed contingent of foreign police arrives in Haiti as Kenya-led force prepares to face gangs,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/backed-contingent-foreign-police-arrives-haiti-kenya-led-111407298,2024-06-25 21:02:08,"The first U.N.-backed contingent of foreign police officers has arrived in Haiti, nearly two years after the troubled Caribbean country urgently requested help to quell a surge in gang violence. PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- The first U.N.-backed contingent of foreign police arrived in Haiti on Tuesday, nearly two years after the troubled Caribbean country urgently requested help to quell a surge in gang violence.. A couple hundred police officers from Kenya landed in the capital of Port-au-Prince, whose main international airport reopened in late May after gang violence forced it to close for nearly three months.. It wasn’t immediately known what the Kenyans’ first assignment would be, but they will face violent gangs that control 80% of Haiti’s capital and have left more than 580,000 people homeless across the country as they pillage neighborhoods in their quest to control more territory. Gangs also have killed several thousand people in recent years.. The Kenyans’ arrival marks the fourth major foreign military intervention in Haiti. While some Haitians welcome them, others view the force with caution, given that the previous intervention — the U.N.’s 2004-2017 peacekeeping mission — was marred by allegations of sexual assault and the introduction of cholera, which killed nearly 10,000 people.. Romain Le Cour, senior expert at Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, urged the international community and government officials to share details, including the mission’s rules of engagement and concept of operation.. “What is going to happen vis-a-vis the gangs,” he said. “Is it a static mission? Is it a moving mission? All those details are still missing, and I think it’s about time that there’s actually transparency.”. Hours after the Kenyans landed, Prime Minister Garry Conille thanked the East African country for its solidarity, noting that gangs have vandalized homes and hospitals and set libraries on fire, making Haiti “unlivable.”. “The country is going through very difficult times,” he said at a news conference. “Enough is enough. ... We’re going to start working little by little to retake the country."". Conille said the Kenyans would be deployed in the next couple of days, but he did not provide details. He was accompanied by Monica Juma, Kenya's former minister of foreign affairs who now serves as national security advisor to President William Ruto. She said the Kenyans will “serve as agents of peace, of stability, of hope.”. “We stand united in our commitment to support Haiti's National Police to restore public order and security,” she said. “It is our hope that this will not become a permanent mission.”. The deployment comes nearly four months after gangs launched coordinated attacks, targeting key government infrastructure in Haiti’s capital and beyond. They seized control of more than two dozen police stations, fired on the main international airport and stormed Haiti’s two biggest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates.. “We’ve been asking for security for the longest time,” said Orgline Bossicot, a 47-year-old mother of two who sells carrots and charcoal as a wholesale distributor. . Gang violence has stymied her sales, and she tries to stay out as late as possible before sundown to make up for the losses despite being afraid.. “You don’t know who’s waiting for you around the corner,” she said, adding that she is hopeful about the Kenyan police joining forces with local authorities. . Critics say the gang attacks that began Feb. 29 could have been prevented if the foreign force had been deployed sooner, but multiple setbacks — including a legal challenge filed in Kenya and political upheaval in Haiti — delayed its arrival.. The attacks prevented then-Prime Minister Ariel Heny, who at the time was in Kenya to push for the deployment, from returning to Haiti. He resigned in late April as the violence surged. Afterward, a nine-member transitional presidential council chose former U.N. official Conille as prime minister and appointed a new Cabinet in mid-June.. Still, the gang violence has persisted, and experts say it will continue unless the government also addresses socioeconomic factors that fuel the existence of gangs in a deeply impoverished country with a severely understaffed and under-resourced police department.. Le Cour said the reaction of the gangs to the mission is difficult to predict. “Some of them might fight. Some of them might want to negotiate and open dialogue with the Haitian government,"" he said.. In a recent video, Jimmy Chérizier, a former elite police officer who now leads a powerful gang federation known as G9 Family and Allies, addressed the new prime minister for the first time.. “Do not play into the hands of traditional politicians and businessmen, who used violence for political and economic ends,"" said Chérizier, best known as Barbecue. ""The problem that exists today can only be resolved through dialogue.”. When asked about Barbecue's comments on Tuesday, Conille responded with a message of his own: “Put down the guns and recognize the authority of the state, and then we will see where we go from there.”. The U.N. Security Council authorized Kenya to lead the multinational police mission in October 2023, a year after Henry first requested immediate help.. President Joe Biden praised the arrival of the first contingent, saying that the mission overall “will bring much needed relief."". “The people of Haiti deserve to feel safe in their homes, build better lives for their families, and enjoy democratic freedoms,” he said. ""While these goals may not be accomplished overnight, this mission provides the best chance of achieving them.”. Rights groups and others have questioned the use Kenyan police, pointing out the years of allegations against officers of abuses, including extrajudicial killings. On Tuesday, police again were accused of opening fire in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, where thousands of protesters stormed the parliament.. Kenyan police in Haiti will be joined by police from the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Chad and Jamaica for a total of 2,500 officers. They will be deployed in phases at a cost of some $600 million a year, according to the U.N. Security Council.. So far, the U.N.-administered fund for the mission has received only $18 million in contributions from Canada, France and the United States. The U.S. also has pledged a total of $300 million in support.. “While gang violence appears to have receded from its peak earlier this year, the country’s security situation remains dire,” the U.N. Security Council said in a June 21 statement.. More than 2,500 people were killed or injured in the first three months of this year, a more than 50% increase from the same period last year.. Many Haitians live in fear, including Jannette Oville, a 54-year-old mother of two university-age boys. She sells crops like plantains and green peppers, and gangs have robbed her several times as she travels aboard public buses with her goods. She tucks money in her armpit or underwear to try to keep it safe, she said.. “I need security. I need to work. I need the roads to open up so I can provide for my family,” she said. “Being a female entrepreneur in Haiti is never easy. There’s a lot of risk. But we take a risk to make sure our families are good.”. An estimated 1.6 million Haitians are on the brink of starvation, the highest number recorded since the devastating 2010 earthquake, according to the U.N.. ___.

abcnews.com,Israel's military must enlist the ultra-Orthodox. What will that mean for Netanyahu and the war?,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israels-courts-military-enlist-ultra-orthodox-netanyahu-111422437,2024-06-25 21:02:19,"Israel's Supreme Court unanimously ordered the government to begin drafted ultra-Orthodox Jewish men into the army. JERUSALEM -- Israel's Supreme Court unanimously ordered the government to begin drafting ultra-Orthodox Jewish men into the army — a landmark ruling seeking to end a system that has allowed them to avoid enlistment into compulsory military service.. Roughly 1.3 million ultra-Orthodox Jews make up about 13% of Israel's population and oppose enlistment because they believe studying full time in religious seminaries is their most important duty. . An enlistment exemption for the ultra-Orthodox goes back to the founding of Israel in 1948, when small numbers of gifted scholars were exempt from the draft. But with a push from politically powerful religious parties, those numbers have swelled over the decades. The court said the exemptions were illegal in 2017, but repeated extensions and government delay tactics have prevented a replacement law from being passed.. Two parties belonging to the Haredim, or “god-fearing” in Hebrew, are essential parts of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s fragile coalition, but the broad exemptions from mandatory military service have reopened a deep divide in the country and infuriated much of the general public during the war in Gaza. Over 600 soldiers have been killed since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Many reserve soldiers are starting their second tour of duty.. Netanyahu’s coalition holds a slim majority of 64 seats in the 120-member parliament, often requiring him to capitulate to the demands of smaller parties like the ultra-Orthodox. . If those parties leave the government, the country would likely be forced into new elections this fall. Netanyahu's popularity is low as the war in Gaza drags into its ninth month.. Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf heads one of the ultra-Orthodox parties in Netanyahu's coalition. In a post on X, Goldknopf called the Supreme Court's ruling “very unfortunate and disappointing,” but did not say whether his party would leave the government. The chairman of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, Aryeh Deri, denounced the ruling and said religious study was “our secret weapon against all enemies.”. The court this year temporarily froze state subsidies for seminaries where exempted ultra-Orthodox men study. Along with the enlistment decision, the court also ruled Tuesday that that money should be permanently suspended. . Many religious seminaries depend on government funding and “the general assumption is that the government will not survive this crisis,” said Barak Medina, a law professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and an expert on constitutional law.. Military service is compulsory for most Jewish men and women, who serve three and two years, respectively, in active duty, as well as reserve duty until around age 40.. The Israeli Supreme Court ruled that compulsory military service applies to the ultra-Orthodox just like any other Israeli. The judges said that allowing a certain community a “sweeping avoidance” of service amounted to discrimination.. “Discrimination regarding the most precious thing of all – life itself – is the worst kind,” the justices wrote in their opinion.. In 2017, the Supreme Court struck down a law that codified draft exemptions. Repeated extensions of the law and government tactics to delay a replacement law have dragged on for years.. Israel’s judiciary plays a large role in checking the government’s executive power. Netanyahu attempted to overhaul the judiciary last year, spurring massive protests across the country before a major part of the overhaul was struck down. . It will be challenging for the army integrate a larger number of ultra-Orthodox deeply opposed to service into its ranks.. Among Israel’s Jewish majority, mandatory military service is largely seen as a melting pot and a rite of passage. The ultra-Orthodox say that integrating into the army will threaten their generations-old way of life, and that their devout lifestyle and dedication to upholding the Jewish commandments protect Israel as much as a strong army does.. The courts did not set numbers for enlistment in their ruling, but Israel’s attorney general’s office suggested that at least 3,000 ultra-Orthodox soldiers enlist in the coming year. The court said in its ruling that some 63,000 ultra-Orthodox students are eligible for enlistment.. For decades, the army has attempted to accommodate ultra-Orthodox soldiers by creating separate units that allow them to maintain religious practices, including minimizing interaction with women. One of the units created for this purpose, Netzah Yehudah, faced possible U.S. sanctions over their treatment of Palestinians, though the U.S. eventually decided not to impose sanctions. . The ruling will have little immediate effect on the war in Gaza, where more than 37,600 Palestinians have been killed, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The number of ultra-Orthodox who might enlist because of the ruling is too small to have a significant impact on day-to-day fighting. . Medina, the law professor, said that if the ruling topples the government, it could give Netanyahu more leeway to reach a deal for a ceasefire that could end the war in Gaza.. “Currently, one of the main reasons he’s prevented from reaching an agreement for the end of the war is because it will mean the end of his coalition,” said Medina.. If the ultra-Orthodox parties leave the coalition, Netanyahu has “nothing to lose,” he said. And that could lead to a change in policy without the pressure from far-right ministers opposed to any kind of ceasefire. Netanyahu will also be under a lot of pressure to wrap up fighting if early elections are called, to avoid going into the elections without the hostages and while a war is still ongoing, Medina said.. ___.

abcnews.com,Brazil’s Supreme Court decriminalizes possession of marijuana for personal use,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/brazils-supreme-court-moves-decriminalizing-possession-marijuana-personal-111416352,2024-06-25 20:54:16,"Brazil’s Supreme Court has voted to decriminalize possession of marijuana for personal use. RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil’s Supreme Court on Tuesday voted to decriminalize possession of marijuana for personal use, making the nation one of Latin America’s last to do so, in a move that could reduce its massive prison population.. With final votes cast on Tuesday, a majority of the justices on the 11-person court have voted in favor of decriminalization since deliberations began in 2015.. The justices must still determine the maximum quantity of marijuana that would be characterized as being for personal use and when the ruling will enter into effect. That is expected to finish as early as Wednesday.. All the justices who have voted in favor said decriminalization should be restricted to possession of marijuana in amounts suitable for personal use. Selling drugs will remain illegal.. In 2006, Brazil’s Congress approved a law that sought to punish individuals caught carrying small amounts of drugs, including marijuana, with alternative penalties such as community service. Experts say the law was too vague and didn’t establish a specific quantity to help law enforcement and judges differentiate personal use from drug trafficking.. Police continued to arrest people carrying small quantities of drugs on trafficking charges and Brazil’s prison population continued to swell.. “The majority of pre-trial detainees and those convicted of drug trafficking in Brazil are first-time offenders, who carried small amounts of illicit substance with them, caught in routine police operations, unarmed and with no evidence of any relationship with organized crime,” said Ilona Szabó, president of Igarapé Institute, a think tank focusing on public security.. Congress has responded to the top court’s ongoing deliberations by separately advancing a proposal to tighten drug legislation, which would complicate the legal picture surrounding marijuana possession.. In April, the Senate approved a constitutional amendment criminalizing possession of any quantity of illicit substance. The lower house’s constitutional committee approved the proposal on June 12, and it will need to pass through at least one other committee before going to a floor vote.. If lawmakers pass such a measure, the legislation would take precedence over the top court’s ruling but still could be challenged on constitutional grounds.. Speaking to reporters in capital Brasilia, the Senate's president, Rodrigo Pacheco, said it isn't the Supreme Court's place to issue a decision on the matter. . “There is an appropriate path for this discussion to move forward and that is the legislative process,” he said. “It is something that, obviously, arouses broad discussion and it is a subject of preoccupation for Congress.”. Last year, a Brazilian court authorized some patients to grow cannabis for medical treatment after the health regulator in 2019 approved guidelines for the sale of medicinal products derived from cannabis. But Brazil is one of a few countries in Latin America that hasn’t decriminalized the possession of small quantities of drugs for personal consumption.. The Supreme Court’s ruling has long been sought by activists and legal scholars in a country where the prison population has become the third largest in the world. Critics of current legislation say users caught with even small amounts of drugs are regularly convicted on trafficking charges and locked up in overcrowded jails, where they are forced to join prison gangs.. “Today, trafficking is the main vector for imprisonment in Brazil,” said Cristiano Maronna, director of JUSTA, a civil society group focusing on the justice system.. Brazil ranks behind U.S. and China in countries with the highest prison populations, according to the World Prison Brief, a database tracking such figures.. Some 852,000 individuals were deprived of liberty in Brazil as of December 2023, according to official data. Of those, nearly 25% were arrested for possession of drugs or trafficking. Brazilian jails are overcrowded, and Black citizens are disproportionately represented, accounting for more than two-thirds of the prison population.. A recent study by Insper, a Brazilian research and education institute, determined that Black individuals found by police with drugs were slightly more likely to be indicted as traffickers than white people. The authors analyzed over 3.5 million records from Sao Paulo’s public security secretariat from 2010 to 2020.. “An advance in drug policy in Brazil! This is an issue of public health, not security and incarceration,” leftist lawmaker Chico Alencar wrote on X after the ruling. . By contrast, Gustavo Scandelari, a specialist on Brazil’s penal code at law firm Dotti Advogados, said he doesn't foresee the ruling bringing about a significant shift from the status quo, even after the top court establishes a maximum quantity of marijuana for personal use. Scandelari argued that the amount will remain one determinant of whether authorities consider a person a dealer or a user, but not the only one.. Some Brazilians, like 47-year-old Rio de Janeiro resident Alexandro Trindade, have managed to be upset with both the Supreme Court decriminalizing marijuana and Congress pushing to keep it illegal.. “The Supreme Court is not the right place (for such decision). This should be submitted to a plebiscite for the people to decide,” Trindade said. “Both the Supreme Court and Congress have been very opposed to society in this.”. As in other countries in the region, like Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, medicinal use of cannabis in Brazil is allowed, though in a highly restricted manner.. Uruguay has fully legalized the use of marijuana, and in some U.S. states recreational use for adults is legal. In Colombia, possession has been decriminalized for a decade, but a law to regulate the recreational use of marijuana so that it can be sold legally failed to pass in the Senate in August. Colombians can carry small amounts of marijuana, but selling it for recreational purposes is not legal.. The same goes for Ecuador and Peru. Both distribution and possession remain illegal in Venezuela.. Argentina’s Supreme Court ruled in 2009 it was unconstitutional to penalize an adult for consuming marijuana if it didn’t harm others. But the law has not been changed and users are still arrested, although most cases are thrown out by judges.. Uruguay became the first country to legalize marijuana for recreational use in 2013 although it was only implemented in 2017. Uruguay’s whole industry, from production to distribution, is under state control and registered users can buy up to 40 grams of marijuana per month through pharmacies.. ___.

LONDON -- Britain's gambling regulator has alleged that five more police officers bet on the timing of the July 4 national election, the Metropolitan Police said Tuesday, as claims widen that people close to the government used inside information for their own profit.. The Metropolitan Police said the Gambling Commission passed on information on the five officers' alleged misconduct. The officers, who provided protection for royalty, politicians and diplomats, have not been arrested.. An investigation by the gambling watchdog is ongoing, police said. . The development comes after it emerged that several members of the governing Conservative Party and one of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's police bodyguards were being investigated for allegedly using inside information to place bets on the date of the election before it was announced.. The bodyguard was arrested last week on suspicion of misconduct in public office.. The scandal, coming just days ahead of the national election, has overshadowed the Conservatives' campaign. The party is widely expected to lose to the opposition Labour Party after 14 years in power.. On Tuesday, the Conservative Party said it was pulling support for two election candidates, Craig Williams and Laura Saunders, who were under investigation by the Gambling Commission over the alleged betting. But because nominations have closed, both politicians will remain on the ballot paper. . Williams said he would continue with his campaign, is cooperating with the commission and plans to clear his name. . “I committed an error of judgment, not an offense, and I want to reiterate my apology directly to you,"" he said in a video posted on the X social media platform. . Williams was Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary as well as a member of Parliament running for reelection on July 4. He has acknowledged that he was being investigated for placing a 100-pound ($128) bet on a July election days before the date had been announced.. Saunders' husband, Tony Lee, the Conservative director of campaigning, has taken a leave of absence following allegations he was also investigated over alleged betting.. A fourth Conservative, the party's chief data officer Nick Mason, was also reportedly being investigated over the matter. . In a new twist on the scandal, Labour said Tuesday it had suspended one of its own parliamentary candidates, Kevin Craig, after being told the Gambling Commission was investigating him over betting on the outcome of his own race.. Craig apologized for a “stupid error of judgment” and revealed he actually bet against himself, assuming he would not win the seat in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, where the Conservatives won by a majority of more than 23,000 in 2019.. ___.

abcnews.com,"Iran's supreme leader warns sole reformist in presidential race, while calling for 'maximum' turnout",https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/irans-supreme-leader-calls-maximum-turnout-presidential-election-111394270,2024-06-25 09:26:26,"Iran’s supreme leader has issued a thinly veiled warning to the sole reformist candidate in the country’s upcoming presidential election. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's supreme leader issued a thinly veiled warning Tuesday to the sole reformist candidate in the country's upcoming presidential election, saying anyone who believes “all ways to progress” come from the United States shouldn't be supported.. While often speaking in parables like many Iranian politicians, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared to directly undercut the candidacy of 69-year-old heart surgeon Masoud Pezeshkian, who has aligned himself with officials from the administration of former President Hassan Rouhani. Rouhani helped reach Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, an accord Pezeshkian has fully embraced in contrast with his five hard-line opponents, who want an agreement fully on Iran's terms. . Khamenei also called for “maximum” turnout for Friday's vote, which analysts say could support Pezeshkian. Already, the doctor's rallies have drawn large crowds in major cities, though it remains unclear whether his candidacy alone would be enough to push an apathetic public to vote to replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi, a protégé of Khamenei who died in a helicopter crash in May.. “Some politicians in our country believe they must kowtow to this power or that power, and it’s impossible to progress without sticking to famous countries and powers,"" Khamenei said in a speech marking the Shiite holiday of Eid al-Ghadir. “Some think like that. Or they think that all ways to progress pass through America. No, such people can’t” run the country well, he said. . Khamenei’s comments in his hourlong speech drew repeated cries of “Death to America, death to Israel” from a raucous crowd. The 85-year-old Khamenei had to urge the crowd to quiet themselves several times during his remarks. . Khamenei’s call comes after a parliamentary election that saw a record low turnout earlier this year. Voters across the capital, Tehran, who have spoken with The Associated Press have expressed widespread apathy over the election as Iran faces an economy crushed by Western sanctions and after widespread anti-government protests in recent years, particularly after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and women refusing to wear the country’s mandatory headscarf, or hijab.. Pezeshkian, little known to the general public before registering for the campaign, has drawn large crowds in Tehran and other major cities. Among his most-prominent allies is former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who led negotiations for the nuclear deal. . Khamenei's remarks also can be seen as a warning to Zarif and even Rouhani himself, whose former administration has been blasted by hard-liners in the time since the collapse of the deal in 2018 after then-U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal. Since then, Iran has advanced its program to enrich uranium up to weapons-grade levels while also hampering the ability of international inspectors to monitor it. . Pezeshkian also has been trying to adopt symbols of previous campaigns by popular reformists, who seek to change Iran’s theocracy from inside. His campaign slogan “For Iran,” a call to nationalism rather than religion, mirrors an earlier campaign slogan used by former reformist President Mohammad Khatami.. Pezeshkian also has been photographed wearing green scarves — apparently trying to associate himself with the 2009 Green Movement protests that swept Iran after the disputed vote and bloody crackdown that saw hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected as president. . Khamenei made a point to seemingly link the upcoming election to the wider tensions in the Mideast amid the Israel-Hamas war.. “The Islamic Republic has enemies. One thing that helps the Islamic Republic overcome its enemies are the elections,"" Khamenei said. ""If a good turnout is seen in these elections, it will make the Islamic Republic proud.”. However, Friday's vote comes after a record-low turnout in Iran’s March parliamentary election of just under 41%. Similar numbers could be seen in the presidential election as well. . If all the hard-line candidates stay in, they could split the vote against Pezeshkian and could force a second round of voting a week later as Iranian law requires a winner to receive more than 50% of all votes cast. Typically though, candidates drop out after the last debate and coalesce around one clear front runner. . “Pezeshkian is leading and over the next three days he will definitely widen the gap with others,"" said analyst Abbas Abdi, who is aligned with reformists. “Withdrawing is not going to help them.” . Noting how all levers of Iran's government had been held by hard-liners under Raisi without any change, Abdi added, ""The ruling system has made a policy shift because it has realized that unifying the ruling system doesn’t work.”. Khamenei's remarks appeared timed to give his opponents ammunition for the last televised debate before the election, which happened just a short time later. Pezeshkian did not directly acknowledge the supreme leader's remarks, but stuck to his stance that talks to restore the deal remained key.. “Who should be blamed for these problems in the governmental offices and the inflation and prices of meat, bread and housing?” Pezeshkian said, before sarcastically answering: “America probably made these too!”. Hard-line candidate Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi repeatedly criticized Pezeshkian, particularly his ties to reformists. In one exchange, Ghazizadeh Hashemi sought to suggest Pezeshkian supporters could violently protest if he loses. . “Who started the troublemaking in the country? Who used to call people to the streets when they didn’t gain power?” he said. “I am worried that if Dr. Pezeshkian doesn’t win, his supporters, who have a notable history in this matter, will once again claim fraud and call people to the streets.”. Pezeshkian responded by mocking Ghazizadeh Hashemi for promising in the 2021 presidential campaign that he would solve all the problems in the country's stock market in three days. The state TV feed of the debate showed Ghazizadeh Hashemi giving Pezeshkian a side-eye glance before cutting away. . ""I've always taken the side of the oppressed and never taken the side of the oppressor,"" Pezeshkian later said. . ___.

abcnews.com,South Sudan says its 6M antelope make up world’s largest land mammal migration,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/south-sudan-6m-antelope-make-worlds-largest-land-111398606,2024-06-25 16:46:31,"South Sudan's most comprehensive aerial wildlife survey found about 6 million antelope — a figure that would make it the world's largest land mammal migration. BADINGILO and BOMA NATIONAL PARKS, South Sudan -- Seen from the air, they ripple across the landscape — a river of antelope racing across the vast grasslands of South Sudan in what conservationists say is the world's largest land mammal migration.. The country's first comprehensive aerial wildlife survey, released Tuesday, found about 6 million antelope. The survey over a two-week period last year in two national parks and nearby areas relied on spotters in airplanes, nearly 60,000 photos and tracking more than a hundred collared animals over about 46,000 square miles (120,000 square kilometers).. The estimate from the nonprofit African Parks, which conducted the work along with the government, far surpasses other large migratory herds such as the estimated 1.36 million wildebeests surveyed last year in the Serengeti straddling Tanzania and Kenya. But they warned that the animals face a rising threat from commercial poaching in a nation rife with weapons and without strong law enforcement.. “Saving the last great migration of wildlife on the planet is an incredibly important thing,"" said Mike Fay, a conservation scientist who led the survey. “There’s so much evidence that the world’s ecosystems are collapsing, the world resources are being severely degraded and it’s causing gigantic disruption on the planet.”. The east African nation is still emerging from five years of fighting that erupted in 2013 and killed nearly 400,000 people. Elections scheduled for last year were postponed to this December, but few preparations are in place for those. Violence continues in some areas, with some 2 million people displaced and 9 million — 75% of the population — reliant on humanitarian aid, according to the United Nations.. The migration is already being touted as a point of national pride by a country trying to move beyond its conflict-riddled past. Billboards of the migration recently went up in the capital of Juba, and the government has aspirations that the animals may someday be a magnet for tourists.. South Sudan has six national parks and a dozen game reserves covering more than 13% of the terrain. The migration stretches from east of the Nile in Badingilo and Boma parks into neighboring Ethiopia — an area roughly the size of the U.S. state of Georgia. It includes four main antelope, the white-eared kob — of which there are some 5 million — the tiang, the Mongalla gazelle and bohor reedbuck. . The survey said some animals have increased since a more limited one in 2010. But it described a “catastrophic” decline of most non-migratory species in the last 40 years, such as the hippo, elephant and warthog. Associated Press journalists flying over the stunning migration of thousands of antelope last week saw few giraffes and no elephants, lions or cheetahs.. Trying to protect the animals over such a vast terrain is challenging. . In recent years, new roads have increased people's access to markets, contributing to poaching. Years of flooding have meant crop failures that have left some people with little choice but to hunt for food. Some 30,000 animals were being killed each month between March and May this year, African Parks estimated.. The government hasn't made a priority of protecting wildlife. Less than 1% of its budget is allocated to the wildlife ministry, which said it has few cars to move rangers around to protect animals. Those rangers say they haven't been paid a salary since October and are outgunned by poachers.. South Sudan President H.E. Salva Kiir Mayardit said the country is committed to turning its wealth of wildlife into sustainable tourism. He called on the Ministry of Wildlife to prioritize training and equipping rangers to fight poaching.. Matthew Kauffman, an associate professor of zoology at the University of Wyoming who specializes in research into migration and ecosystems, said the work fits a growing global effort “to map these migrations."" One benefit is to be smarter when landscapes are developed to make way for these seasonal movements, he said.. Villagers near the parks told AP they mostly hunted to feed their families or to barter for goods. . A newly paved road between Juba and Bor — the epicenter of the illegal commercial bushmeat trade — has made it easier for trucks to carry large quantities of animals. Bor sits along the Nile, about 27 miles (45 kilometers) from Badingilo Park. In the dry season, animals coming closer to the town to drink are vulnerable to killing.. Officials at the wildlife ministry in Bor told AP the killing of animals had doubled in the last two years.. Even when those involved in the industry are caught, the consequences can be minor. A few years ago, when wildlife rangers came to arrest Lina Garang for selling animals, she said they let her go, instead telling her to conduct business more discreetly. Garang, 38, said her competition has only grown, with 15 new shops opening along her strip to buy and sell animals.. Part of the challenge is that there is no national land management plan, so roads and infrastructure are built without initial discussions about where best placed. The government’s also allocated an oil concession to a South African company in the middle of Badingilo that spans nearly 90% of the park. . African Parks is trying to square modernizing the country with preserving the wildlife. The organization has been criticized in the past for not engaging enough with communities and taking an overly militarized approach in some of the nearly two dozen areas it manages in Africa. . The group says its strategy in South Sudan is focused on community relations and aligning the benefits of wildlife and economic development. One plan is to create land conservancies that local communities would manage, with input from national authorities. . African Parks has set up small hubs in several remote villages and is spreading messages of sustainable practices, such as not killing female or baby animals.. Peter Alberto, undersecretary for the ministry of wildlife, conservation and tourism, said the government hopes the migration can become a point of pride, and reshape how the world thinks of South Sudan.. As for tourism, that may take a while. There aren't hotels or roads to host people near the parks, and the only option is high-end trips for what one tour company official called a “high-risk” audience. There’s fighting between tribes and attacks by gunmen in the area, and pilots told AP they’ve been shot at while flying.. Will Jones, chief exploration officer for Journeys by Design, a UK-based tour company, charges roughly $150,000 per person for a weeklong tour in South Sudan. He said there isn't strong demand. . Locals trying to protect the wildlife say it’s hard to shift people's mentality.. In the remote village of Otallo on the border with Ethiopia, young men have started buying motorbikes.

LYON, France -- Brazilian police official Valdecy Urquiza won a crucial vote of confidence Tuesday toward becoming the next head of Interpol — and its first leader from a developing country — after its executive committee selected the 43-year-old as its preferred candidate.. Urquiza, Interpol's vice president for the Americas, is on a key track to be selected for the job by the Lyon, France-based organization's general assembly in Glasgow, Scotland on Nov. 7. The assembly has always followed the recommendations for the choice of the secretary-general from the committee, which is currently made up of 13 members. . The Interpol secretary-general essentially runs the organization on a daily basis. Jürgen Stock of Germany, who has held the post since 2014, is not allowed under its rules to seek a third term.. The organization has never had a secretary-general who did not come from Europe or the United States. . Interpol, which has 196 member countries and celebrated its centennial last year, works to help national police forces communicate with each other and track suspects and criminals in fields like counterterrorism, financial crime, child pornography, cybercrime and organized crime. . The world’s biggest — if not best-funded — police organization has been grappling with new challenges including a growing caseload of cybercrime and child sex abuse, and increasing divisions among its member countries.. Interpol had a total budget of about 176 million euros (about $188 million) last year, compared to more than 200 million euros at the European Union's police agency, Europol, and some $11 billion at the FBI in the United States. . “Interpol already lacks the means to do its most basic work, so it's going to be very limited in taking on new missions,” said Robert Schmidt, co-author of a French language book published last year whose title translates as “Interpol: The Investigation.” . “It has a role to play and its reputation is intact, but it's true that a limited budget will necessarily constrain its capabilities,” he said. . Urquiza, who heads international cooperation for the Brazilian police force, holds degrees in law and public administration and is a graduate of the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia. . The other finalists were Stephen Kavanagh of Britain, Interpol's current executive director for police services; Mubita Nawa of Zambia, administrative director of the African country's police service; and Faisal Shahkar of Pakistan, the head of the U.N. police division.. Urquiza and another board member, from Britain, recused themselves for the committee decision.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

LONDON -- Four men were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of trespassing after entering the grounds of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's country estate in northern England, police said.. North Yorkshire police said the group was detained just after noon and arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass. . A group called Youth Demand posted video showing a man in boots step into Sunak's pond, where he pretended to defecate. . The group said in a statement chock-full of a crude four-letter word for human waste that it was a “parting gift” to the prime minister. It said the stool used in the stunt was made of latex so it could be retrieved and prevent environmental damage.. Sunak was in London at the time for the state visit by the Japanese emperor and empress.. The incident comes just over a week before the U.K.’s general election that will determine if Sunak remains in power. Polls and pundits have predicted the Labour Party to take control after 14 years of Conservative rule.. The police officer who confronted the group asked the man identified by the group as “Oliver” what his intentions were, according to video of the incident.. “I think our intentions are carried out,"" he replied.. Youth Demand said it is calling for for a two-way arms embargo on Israel and for the next U.K. government to revoke oil and gas licenses granted since 2021. . The group said the four detained included a press photographer. . Sunak had condemned the group earlier this year when it hung a banner on the home of Labour leader Keir Starmer, saying “Stop the killing,” in reference to Israel's war with Hamas militants. .

abcnews.com,Puerto Rico sues former officials accused of corruption to recover more than $30M in public funds,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/puerto-rico-sues-former-officials-accused-corruption-recover-111408793,2024-06-25 19:02:11,"Puerto Rico’s Justice Department says it is suing at least 30 ex-government officials accused of corruption to recover more than $30 million in public funds. SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Puerto Rico’s Justice Department announced Tuesday it is suing at least 30 former government officials accused of corruption to recover more than $30 million in public funds.. Among those sued are three former legislators, including María Milagros Charbonier, who was sentenced in May to eight years in federal prison after being found guilty of theft, bribery and a kickback scheme.. “We are going to recover the Puerto Rican people’s money and claim an amount that totals three times the damage caused by those who have illegally appropriated public funds,"" said Domingo Emanuelli, the U.S. territory’s justice secretary.. Also sued are eight former mayors including Félix Delgado of Cataño and Ángel Pérez of Guaynabo. Delgado was sentenced to one year in federal prison in March after pleading guilty to accepting bribes in exchange for awarding millions of dollars’ worth of municipal contracts. Pérez was sentenced to more than five years in federal prison in February after being found guilty of bribery and extorsion.. Their attorneys could not be immediately reached for comment.. Puerto Rico’s Justice Department had long been accused of not cracking down sufficiently on widespread government corruption on the island, with federal authorities taking the reins in recent years.. “For the first time on the island, the Puerto Rican Justice Department sued more than 30 convicts for corruption with the purpose of recovering public funds and demanding reparation for the damages they caused to the Puerto Rican people,"" Emanuelli said.. The department also sued two companies, J.R. Asphalt Inc. and Waste Collection Corp. Federal authorities have previously accused them of being linked to government corruption cases. . The Department of Justice stated that according to the civil procedural rules of the U.S. territory, it could implement provisional measures to recover assets and restrict the defendants’ ability to sell property.. The largest lawsuit involves a group of seven people accused of wire fraud and money laundering in Mayaguez, totaling $21.6 million, according to the breakdown of lawsuits by the Department of Justice. Radamés Benítez, former executive assistant to the former mayor of Trujillo Alto, is facing a lawsuit seeking just under $3.1 million, while Delgado has been sued for nearly $1.2 million.. Several mayors have been arrested by the FBI over alleged corruption since the 2020 elections, with other facing local charges. Other high-profile arrests, unrelated to Tuesday's lawsuits include former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vazquez Garced, who was arrested in 2022 for allegedly bribing several people to finance her 2020 gubernatorial election campaign.. Last year, the former mayor of Trujillo Alto, José Luis Cruz Cruz, and Abel Nazario, former senator and former mayor of Yauco, were sentenced to prison after engaging in a bribery scheme and misappropriating municipal funds, respectively. In 2022, former mayors of Aguas Buenas and Humacao, Javier García and Reinaldo Vargas, were arrested on charges of conspiracy, soliciting bribes and extortion.. In 2021, a day after Delgado pleaded guilty to bribery, businessman Mario Villegas was indicted for allegedly paying kickbacks to Delgado, collecting over $9.9 million in municipal contracts for his asphalt and paving company. Villegas was sentenced to over three years in prison.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

TIRANA, Albania -- An Albanian appeals court on Tuesday upheld a two-year prison sentence for an elected mayor of the country’s Greek minority, in a move expected to further exacerbate tension with neighboring Greece.. The appeals court declined to change the verdict of the court of first instance in March on Dhionisios Alfred Beleris, 51, who was imprisoned on charges of vote-buying in municipal elections last year.. Beleris, who has dual citizenship, also won a Greek seat in the European Parliament, representing the governing conservative New Democracy party, in the EU elections earlier this month. . Last year Beleris was elected mayor of Himare, 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of the capital, Tirana. He was arrested two days before the vote, accused of offering 40,000 Albanian leks (360 euro at the time) to buy eight votes. Beleris was never sworn in because he was under arrest and later sentenced to two years imprisonment.. Beleris has denied the charges, and Athens has described his detention as politically motivated. . Greece had called on Albania’s government to stop the process against Beleris, saying the case could negatively impact Albania’s application to join the European Union. Albania, a candidate country, is in the process of negotiating full membership.. Albania’s government said it could do nothing while the case was in court.. European Parliament lawmakers enjoy substantial legal immunity from prosecution, even if the allegations relate to crimes committed prior to their election.. In the case of Beleris, that rule is unlikely to affect the outcome, as he is serving time for a crime committed in a non-EU member country.. “It is a fully democratic request that members of the European Parliament be able to be present in person at all parliamentary sessions, starting from July,” said Greek Ambassador to Albania Kostantina Kamitsi.. Six countries in the Western Balkans – Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia – are at different stages in their applications for EU membership. Croatia was the last EU member country to be accepted in 2013.. Western concerns over regional stability triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine have added urgency to the accession process.. Greece and Albania, a former communist country and a current NATO member, have a historically tense  relationship with uneasy relations at times, largely over issues of Greek minority rights and the sizable Albanian community in Greece.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Ukraine and Moldova set to launch EU membership talks,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ukraine-moldova-set-launch-eu-membership-talks-dream-111393979,2024-06-25 12:54:27,"The European Union has launched membership talks with Ukraine a decade after Russian troops seized the Crimean Peninsula to deter the country from moving closer to the West, part of a chain of events that set the two neighbors on the path to war. BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Tuesday launched membership talks with Ukraine, a decade after Russian troops seized the Crimean Peninsula to deter the country from moving closer to the West, part of a chain of events that set the two neighbors on the path to war.. Ukraine’s accession negotiations were set in motion at an intergovernmental conference in Luxembourg. Just a few hours later, Moldova also launched its membership talks. While the events are a major milestone on their European paths, the talks could take years to conclude.. In opening remarks presented via video-link, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal described it as “a historic day” that marks “a new chapter” in his country’s ties with the bloc, particularly as the war with Russia rages on.. “We fully understand that there is still much work ahead of us on the path to accession. We are ready for it. We have demonstrated that we can move swiftly and achieve the impossible,” Shmyhal said.. Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib, whose country currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency, described it as “a historic moment for us all, and marks a milestone in our relationship.”. Lahbib said the EU condemns “Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine and salutes the resilience of the Ukrainian people,” and added that the bloc will continue to support Ukraine in the war “for as long as it takes and as intensely as needed.”. Ukraine's delegation was led in Luxembourg by deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration Olga Stefanishyna. “This is a truly historical moment for my country. All the nation stands as one behind this decision,” she told reporters as she arrived for the ceremony.. Stefanishyna said the hope embodied in the opening of the talks will give Ukraine's citizens “the moral power to continue withstanding” the Russian invasion.. The intergovernmental conferences officially started the process of aligning the countries' laws and standards with those of the 27-nation bloc, which is notably concerned about corruption in both. However, the actual negotiations are unlikely to begin for a few months.. Ukraine and Moldova applied to join the EU in the days and weeks after Russia invaded in February 2022. By June 2022, EU leaders had quickly made it all official. But things have moved more slowly since then for Kyiv and membership, if it comes, might be years away.. Turkey’s accession talks have lasted almost two decades without result.. Still, starting the talks process is sending another strong signal of solidarity with Ukraine beyond the financial support the EU has provided, which officials estimate at around 100 billion euros ($107 billion). It’s also a show of support for Moldova, which has faced its own challenges with Russia.. “It is a historic event for us in historical times for Europe and it signifies the strong commitment of both sides to European peace, security, stability and prosperity,"" said Prime Minister Dorin Recean. “We will spare no effort to achieve our strategic goal of becoming an EU member.”. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, neighboring Moldova has faced several crises that have at times raised fears the country might also be in Russia’s crosshairs, from errant missiles landing on its territory, to an energy crisis sparked after Moscow cut gas supplies.. “We are very much affected by the brutal war of Russia in Ukraine, and we are helping each other in the security matters but also in the European accession and we will continue to do so,” Recean told reporters.. Candidate countries must bring their laws and standards into line with those of the EU in 35 policy areas, known as chapters, ranging from the free movement of goods through fisheries, taxation, energy and the environment to judicial rights and security.. Unanimous agreement must be given by all 27 member countries to open or close chapters, providing ample opportunity for EU nations to demand more work or to delay proceedings.. Hungary, which takes over the EU’s rotating presidency from Belgium in July, has routinely put the brakes on EU and NATO support for Ukraine.. “We are still at the beginning of the screening process. It’s very difficult to say at what stage Ukraine is in. From what I see here, as we speak, they are very far from meeting the accession criteria,” Hungarian Minister for European Affairs Janos Boka said as he arrived at the venue.. Bordering EU members Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, Ukraine would overtake France to become the largest member of the bloc if it joined, shifting its center of gravity further eastward. As a top grain producer its entry would have a huge impact on EU agriculture policy.. Together with Moldova, Ukraine stands in a long line of EU hopefuls — Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey — with years-long membership aspirations and which have felt left behind by Kyiv’s rapid progress.. Ukraine wants to join by 2030, but it must carry out dozens of institutional and legal reforms first. That daunting list is led by steps to combat corruption and includes broad reforms to public administration and judiciary.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

abcnews.com,Chanel goes to the opera in a gleaming but designer-less couture collection,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chanel-opera-gleaming-designer-couture-collection-111403933,2024-06-25 19:26:23,"Chanel’s latest couture display at the Paris Fashion Week is a finely executed collection channeling theatricality. PARIS -- The show must go on, with aplomb. Chanel’s latest couture display Tuesday was a finely executed collection channeling theatricality.. Few Parisian fashion houses can fill the Paris Opera and gain applause from Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour and other luminaries without even having a designer. It's a testament to Chanel’s enduring power and its world-renowned atelier following Virginie Viard's abrupt exit on June 5.. Here are some highlights of the fall couture displays:. Guests clutching Chanel opera glasses got happily lost as they explored marble staircases to find a stage in the Opera’s outer corridors, filled with red velvet opera boxes designed by French movie director Christophe Honoré. The stage was set with silhouettes evoking the opera and its heyday: dramatic capes, puffed sleeves and richly embroidered pieces.. The designs’ gleam rivaled only that of the sumptuous 19th-century atrium itself, with shimmering buttons and brilliant threads reflecting the light.. There were moments of drama, with guests reaching for their cameras (being too close for the opera glasses) to capture a black gown with puff sleeves whose feathers, beading and ribbons gleamed provocatively.. This season, there was a welcome move to less accessorizing, a departure from the hallmark of former designer Viard. The focus was on the garments themselves, highlighting the intricate craftsmanship and luxurious materials. Feathers, tassels, embroidered flowers, precious braids, lacquered jersey, supple tweeds, silky velvet, illusion tulle, taffeta, and duchesse satin adorned myriad looks befitting the venue.. Although the necklines were a standout feature—scooped or raised mini-turtle necks—alongside banded, accented shoulders or busts, the collection as a whole had a slightly disparate feel that sometimes seemed to lack a singular aesthetic anchor.. Chanel paid tribute to the ateliers of the “petites mains,"" or the dozens of artisans who work in six ateliers a stone’s throw from the venue.. For a house that prides itself on perfect image execution, the news that arrived in the middle of the night felt less than polished. Chanel faced its first major event Tuesday without its creative director, who abruptly left after over 30 years with the brand. The announcement was highly unorthodox, just weeks before the couture show.. Later, it emerged that the French couturier would be absent even from her final couture display, with her team stepping in to take charge.. Viard succeeded Karl Lagerfeld upon his death in 2019 and was his closest collaborator for decades. She had overseen record sales for Chanel, reaching a reported $19.7 billion last year. Ready-to-wear sales reportedly increased 23 percent during her tenure.. Yet in the fickle world of fashion, strong sales are not always enough. Viard’s tenure was dogged by controversy, most recently with criticism of her collections, including a poorly received mid-season show in Marseille. Viard faced backlash for runway shows that critics said lacked the grandiose flair defining Lagerfeld’s era, and she often received critiques for underwhelming design choices.. Though her appointment was initially seen as temporary, she was only the third creative director in Chanel’s over 100-year history after Lagerfeld and, of course, legendary founder Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel.. The fashion world speculates on her successor. Names like Hedi Slimane, Marine Serre and Simon Porte Jacquemus circulate, suggesting potential shifts in Chanel’s creative direction.. To nostalgic jazz music, 89-year-old fashion veteran Giorgio Armani returned to his touchstones of the Art Deco period — the 1920s and ’30s — and romance for a slow-burning and brightly gleaming couture display at the Palais de Tokyo. It was called “Pearls.”. Models donned berets in a show that glowed not only with pearls but also with velvets, silk chiffons and tulle, and ended in froths of sparkle. The meticulous craftsmanship, with embellishments like sequins, crystals and rhinestone embroideries, gave Armani's pieces a luminous, ethereal quality for fall that dazzled the eye as it was showcased by slow-walking models. On occasion, Armani was victim to his romantic spirit when he veered into the literal, such as one diamond-encrusted beret. . But tailoring — a design cornerstone for Armani, who cut his cloth in menswear — was a powerful theme in the show. A black angular jacket captured the collection theme perfectly, with its curved, graphic-lined lapel gleaming with myriad pearls adorning the shoulders.. Armani is often linked to the word “timeless” and praised for his ability to create pieces that remain stylish and relevant across decades. This strength reassures the audience, but while always beautiful, the pieces on display Tuesday sometimes lacked the surprise seen in other couture shows this season.. What remains relevant is the Italian runway icon’s enduring influence on the fashion and entertainment industries, as seen by the swath of top editors and stars such as Cate Blanchett, Jodie Turner-Smith, Naomie Harris and Eva Green, who lined the front row. So iconic, in fact, th at there was a new adjective for him revealed in the show notes — “Armanian.”. Bubbles are never far away from the effervescent couturier Alexis Mabille. Guests sipped champagne, with champagne-filled ice buckets even on the runway in a celebration of luxurious excess.. Unfurling, undressing, and plays on corsetry were on the drinks menu this season, starting with an opening number featuring a gleaming bustier that resembled an opening flower. The intimacy and ritual of getting dressed is a theme that pervades Mabille's work.. Varied looks sometimes surprised guests, such as a Bob Mackie-style feathered headdress that out-Cher-ed Cher. The extravagant piece had an almost equestrian flourish and was a real feat of couture execution, showcasing Mabille’s flair for Hollywood-inspired glamour.. A golden bullet creation, and a gleaming metallic power cape with an armor-like bustier, gave the collection a lot of attitude, if not always coherence. Mabille’s collections often embrace a wide array of silhouettes and themes, sometimes leading to a lack of unified narrative. However, the diversity is also part of his charm.. Charles de Vilmorin, the 27-year-old wunderkind of the Parisian couture scene, has once again proven his mettle with a spellbinding show that merged experimental silhouettes, dark musings, and eye-catching color palettes. Known for his vibrant use of color, de Vilmorin’s palette often evokes the sumptuousness of Christian Lacroix’s 1980s work, making him one of the most buzzed-about couturiers in Paris today.. On Tuesday, the audience was transported to a gothic dreamscape where Anna Cleveland emerged as a bewitching figure, trapped in a black straight-jacket gown that screamed both asylum and Tim Burton. De Vilmorin, known for grappling with the pressures of creation and the lofty expectations of the fashion world, channeled these tensions into his collection.. Another ‘straight-jacket’ gown appeared adorned with massive black and red plumes, like a satanic phoenix rising from the ashes. The storytelling that followed was nothing short of a sartorial saga. A gigantic rat scurried down the runway, followed by a model donning an oversized witch’s hat with a fringe of hair.. Adding to the darkly whimsical narrative was a nobleman figure, clad in a crisply wrinkled white bow shirt tied with whimsical flair. This juxtaposition of elegance and dishevelment was pure De Vilmorin. The show’s crescendo was a color-blocked blue and red chiffon Renaissance gown, a nod to historical opulence with a contemporary twist.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Poland rolls out 'Holidays with the Army' in a recruitment drive with Russia in mind,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/poland-rolls-holidays-army-recruitment-drive-russia-mind-111394172,2024-06-25 05:02:06,"Poland’s army has launched a program called “Holidays with the Army” to train young volunteers in combat. NOWOGROD, Poland -- With assault rifles laid out before them, the young Polish men and women kneel on the grass and follow orders on how to pack their survival kits. Next comes a lesson on applying camouflage paint to their faces. Not too much neon, an instructor says as he shows them how to add dark streaks of green.. Many at the training in eastern Poland are new high school graduates, with the men's heads freshly shaven and the women's hair tied back. They have signed up for a new summer program, “Holidays with the Army,” which offers basic military training for thousands of Poles aged 18 to 35.. The military introduced the program in a search for recruits as Poland expands its 198,000-member army in the face of renewed Russian aggression in the region, including neighboring Ukraine.. Despite the program's name, this is no holiday. The recruits rise early to learn combat and survival skills. When not in the field, they clean their quarters. There is no leaving the base, 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the border with Belarus, for visits home or nights out. They earn 6,000 zlotys ($1,500) for the 28 days.. There has been great interest in the program, which is taking place at 70 locations across Poland, officials say. . Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has sparked an impulse among Poles to want to defend the nation, said Maj. Michal Tomczyk, a spokesperson at the Defense Ministry.. “We haven’t had such a threat since World War II,"" Tomczyk said. He said they had planned for 10,000 volunteers for the program and have more than 11,000.. At the end of the training, the volunteers will take a soldier’s oath in which they swear “to serve loyally the Republic of Poland ... even at the cost of losing my life or blood.” Those who choose a military life can join a branch of the professional armed services or the Territorial Defense Forces or be on standby as reservists, said Col. Pawel Galazka, commander of the 18th Lomza Logistics Regiment, a unit training the volunteers.. “The army wants to train as many citizens as possible,” Galazka said. “Everyone knows about the threat that comes from the east.”. The Lomza regiment's training field is in a forest clearing near the Narew River. The surrounding area has been defended by generations of Poles, from the time when Poland was partitioned and ruled by foreign powers starting in the late 18th century until the early 20th century, to World War II, when the Germans and Soviets invaded.. Bunkers in the area are evidence of the Polish defense line that was broken when Nazi Germany invaded in 1939, sparking World War II.. The patriotism nurtured by the history passed on in schools and by families helped motivate young people to join the new program, Galazka said.. One volunteer, 18-year-old Dominik Rojek, originally planned to study computer science. But the troubles in the region led him to shift to a military career, driven by the desire to defend the homeland. He hopes he can still pursue his passion for computer science in the military and use his skills in cyberdefense.. “Someone has to do it,” Rojek said. “Not everyone is capable of this, but we are capable of this. ... There is no other way.”. Rojek's generation came of age in peace and enjoyed the rising prosperity that has been the dividend of Moscow-backed communism’s collapse across the region 35 years ago.. But young Poles, like those of their generation along NATO's entire eastern front, fear they can no longer take that peace for granted.. Russia’s initial seizure of Ukrainian territory in 2014 sent jitters through the region. But its full-scale invasion has brought a major security realignment from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and forced nations and individuals to consider the prospect of one day taking up arms.. Sweden and Finland broke with their neutrality to join NATO, and some nations are considering introducing compulsory conscription. Denmark says it plans to expand its conscription to include women.. In Poland, a member of both NATO and the European Union, the threat feels close. Some stray Russian missiles have landed in Poland.. At the border with Belarus, an ally of Russia, migrants arrive in large numbers trying to enter every day, and have recently attacked Polish officials, killing one soldier. Warsaw says the migration pressure has been created by Russia and Belarus and view it as a form of hybrid warfare against the West.. “The Russians and the Belarusians have engineered an assault on our border,” Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said at a recent international conference in Berlin devoted to Ukraine's recovery.. Russian officials have repeatedly threatened Poland. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president and ally of President Vladimir Putin, has called Poland a “dangerous enemy” that risks losing its statehood.. Along Poland's northern border is the Russian territory of Kaliningrad, where Poland believes Moscow stores about 100 tactical nuclear warheads.. Poles must think about what could happen and be prepared, said 34-year-old Magdalena Klos, one of the volunteers in the new training.. She had long dreamed of becoming a soldier but was waiting for her children to be old enough.

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- Flooding and landslides in Ivory Coast’s largest city of Abidjan have left at least 24 people dead following a week of heavy rains, four times the usual volume in some cases, authorities said Tuesday. . Flood-related deaths are not uncommon in the West African nation during the rainy season, but according to the Ivorian meteorological agency, the recent rainfall was particularly violent with that more than 200 millimeters (8 inches) in some districts, four times the usual amount in a day.. Informal settlements are particularly vulnerable because of poor storm drainage among homes often built quickly without zoning regulations.. The flooding and landslides have also caused “significant” damage across the city, flooding houses and roads, said the Ivory Coast National Office for Civil Protection. At least 271 people who were trapped after the rains have been successfully rescued, it said.. Officials last year demolished houses built along a lagoon in Abidjan as a measure to prevent deadly floods.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

MADISON, Wis. -- Supporters of former President Donald Trump submitted 16 more valid signatures than needed to force a recall election of Wisconsin’s top elected Republican depending on what district the recall should be held in, based on a review by the state elections commission released Tuesday.. The Wisconsin Elections Commission will meet Thursday to vote on whether to order a recall election targeting Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. But the key question for the commission will be whether signatures to force the recall needed to come from the district Vos was elected to represent in the 2022 election, or if they should have come from his district created under new maps in effect for the 2024 election.. If the old maps are used, petition circulators gathered just enough signatures to force a recall, the elections commission staff said. If the new maps are used, they fell more than 3,000 signatures short. The staff took no position on which maps should be used.. The commission’s decision on whether to call the recall election can be appealed to circuit court.. Recall organizers targeted Vos, the longest-serving Assembly speaker in Wisconsin history, after he refused calls to decertify President Joe Biden’s narrow win in the state. Biden’s win of about 21,000 votes has withstood two partial recounts, numerous lawsuits, an independent audit and a review by a conservative law firm. . Vos further angered Trump supporters when he did not back a plan to impeach Meagan Wolfe, the state’s top elections official.. Vos, who has derided those targeting him as “whack jobs and morons,” said in a statement that he was confident the petitioners have not gathered enough legal signatures and will make that argument to the commission on Thursday.. The elections commission asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to clarify whether any recall election should take place in the district where Vos was elected to serve, or under new district boundary lines that take effect for the regular November election.. The court in April declined to further clarify or amend its December ruling that found the current maps to be unconstitutional and barred their future use.. Vos asserted that the recall effort must be rejected because of the Supreme Court’s order barring any future elections using the old district lines. But petition circulators said it can go forward because the state constitution allows for the recall of any incumbent.. Elections staff did not take a side, leaving it up to the bipartisan commission to decide what to do.. If the commission decides to order a recall election, it would be held on Aug. 6. If more than two candidates run in a recall election, the primary for that would be Aug. 6, with the recall election Sept. 3.. The state's regular fall primary election, where Vos will be on the ballot seeking another two-year term, is Aug. 13. Even if there is a recall election and Vos loses, he would only be out of office through the end of the year. He could win the general election and be back in office starting in January. The Legislature is not scheduled to be in session again until January.. Trump supporters, including former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, on May 28 submitted more than 9,000 signatures to trigger the recall election. . They needed 6,850 valid signatures to force a recall election in the district where Vos was elected to serve. There were 6,866 valid signatures collected from that district. . There needed to be 7,195 from Vos's new district for a recall, but only 3,807 were collected from that one, the elections commission report said.. In March, the group submitted more than 9,000 signatures, but the elections commission determined that only 5,905 of them were valid. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,A look at Julian Assange and how the long-jailed WikiLeaks founder is now on the verge of freedom,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/julian-assange-long-jailed-wikileaks-founder-now-verge-111388356,2024-06-24 22:30:15,"News that the U.S. Justice Department has reached a plea deal with Julian Assange brings a stunning culmination to a long-running saga of international intrigue that spanned multiple continents and has had as its central character a quixotic internet p.... WASHINGTON -- News that the U.S. Justice Department has reached a plea deal that will lead to freedom for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange brings a stunning culmination to a long-running saga of international intrigue that spanned multiple continents. Its central character is a quixotic internet publisher with a profound disdain for government secrets.. A look at Assange, the case and the latest developments:. An Australian editor and publisher, he is best known for having founded the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, which gained massive attention — and notoriety — for the 2010 release of almost half a million documents relating to the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.. His activism made him a cause célèbre among press freedom advocates who said his work in exposing U.S. military misconduct in foreign countries made his activities indistinguishable from what traditional journalists are expected to do as part of their jobs. . But those same actions put him in the crosshairs of American prosecutors, who released an indictment in 2019 that accused Assange — holed up at the time in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London — of conspiring with an Army private to illegally obtain and publish sensitive government records.. “Julian Assange is no journalist,” John Demers, the then-top Justice Department national security official, said at the time. “No responsible actor, journalist or otherwise, would purposely publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in war zones, exposing them to the gravest of dangers.”. The Trump administration’s Justice Department accused Assange of directing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history. . The charges relate to WikiLeaks’ publication of thousands of leaked military and diplomatic documents, with prosecutors accusing Assange of helping Manning steal classified diplomatic cables that they say endangered national security and of conspiring together to crack a Defense Department password.. Reports from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq published by Assange included the names of Afghans and Iraqis who provided information to American and coalition forces, prosecutors said, while the diplomatic cables he released exposed journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates and dissidents in repressive countries.. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison after being convicted of violating the Espionage Act and other offenses for leaking classified government and military documents to WikiLeaks. President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017, allowing her release after about seven years behind bars. . Assange has spent the last five years in a British high-security prison, fighting to avoid extradition to the U.S. and winning favorable court rulings that have delayed any transfer across the Atlantic.. He was evicted in April 2019 from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he had sought refuge seven years earlier amid an investigation by Swedish authorities into claims of sexual misconduct that he has long denied and that was later dropped. The South American nation revoked the political asylum following the charges by the U.S. government.. Despite his arrest and imprisonment by British authorities, extradition efforts by the U.S. had stalled prior to the plea deal.. A U.K. judge in 2021 rejected the U.S. extradition request in 2021 on the grounds that Assange was likely to kill himself if held under harsh U.S. prison conditions. Higher courts overturned that decision after getting assurances from the U.S. about his treatment. The British government signed an extradition order in June 2022.. Then, last month, two High Court judges ruled that Assange can mount a new appeal based on arguments about whether he will receive free-speech protections or be at a disadvantage because he is not a U.S. citizen. The date of the hearing has yet to be determined.. Assange will have to plead guilty to a felony charge under the Espionage Act of conspiring to unlawfully obtain and disseminate classified information relating to the national defense of the United States, according to a Justice Department letter filed in federal court.. Rather than face the prospect of prison time in the U.S., he is expected to return to Australia after his plea and sentencing. Those proceedings are scheduled for Wednesday morning, local time in Saipan, the largest island in the Mariana Islands.. The hearing is taking place there because of Assange’s opposition to traveling to the continental U.S. and the court’s proximity to Australia.. On Monday evening, he left a British prison ahead of a court hearing expected to result in his release.. It's not, but beyond his interactions with Manning, Assange is well-known for the role WikiLeaks played in the 2016 presidential election, when it released a massive tranche of Democratic emails that federal prosecutors say were stolen by Russian intelligence operatives.. The goal, officials have said, was to harm the electoral effort of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and boost her Republican challenger Donald Trump, who famously said during the campaign: “WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks.”. Assange was not charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the investigation nonetheless painted an unflattering role of WikiLeaks in advancing what prosecutors say was a brazen campaign of Russian election interference.. Assange denied in a Fox News interview that aired in January 2017 that Russians were the source of the hacked emails, though those denials are challenged by a 2018 indictment by Mueller of 12 Russian military intelligence officers.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee's top election office has sent letters to more than 14,000 registered voters asking them to prove their citizenship, a move that alarmed voting rights advocates as possible intimidation.. The letters, dated June 13, warned that it is illegal in Tennessee for noncitizens to vote and provided instructions on how to update voter information. The list was developed after comparing voter rolls with data from the state Department of Safety and Homeland Security, said Doug Kufner, spokesperson for the Secretary of State's office, in a statement Tuesday. . Kufner described the data from the state's homeland security department as a “snapshot” of a person's first interaction with that agency. Some may not have been U.S. citizens when they obtained a driver's license or ID card but have since been naturalized and “likely did not update their records,"" he said. Driver's licenses in Tennessee must be renewed every eight years.. “Accurate voter rolls are a vital component to ensuring election integrity, and Tennessee law makes it clear that only eligible voters are allowed to participate in Tennessee elections,” Kufner said. . The letter does not, however, reveal what would happen to those who do not update their records — including whether people who fail to respond will be purged from the voter rolls. Kufner did not immediately respond to an email seeking clarity on if voters were at risk of being removed.. Instead, the letter contains warnings that illegal voting is a felony and carries penalties of up to two years in prison.. Voting rights advocates began raising the alarm after photos of the letter started circulating on social media. Democrats have long criticized the Secretary of State's office for its stances on voting issues in the Republican-dominant state. . “The fact legal citizens of the United States and residents of Tennessee are being accused of not being eligible to vote is an affront to democracy,"" said state Rep. Jason Powell, a Democrat from Nashville, in a statement. “These fine Tennesseans are being burdened with re-proving their own voter eligibility and threatened with imprisonment in a scare tactic reminiscent of Jim Crow laws.”. Powell and fellow Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons on Tuesday urged Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti to investigate the issue. . Democratic Rep. Gloria Johnson, a Democrat from Knoxville, said she was informed that one of the letter recipients included a “respected scientist in Oak Ridge” who had become a citizen and registered to vote in 2022. . “Maybe the state should verify citizenship with the federal government before sending threatening/intimidating letters to new citizens,” Johnson posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.. Other leaders encouraged those who received a letter to reach out to the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee for possible legal resources.. ""It is surely capturing many, many, many eligible citizens on the rolls and threatening them with criminal prosecution,"" said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights program at The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law. “I think it’s unconscionable. And I think that it likely violates a number of federal laws as well.”. The effort bears some resemblance to the rollout of a sweeping Texas voting law passed in 2021, in which thousands of Texans — including some U.S. citizens — received letters saying they have been flagged as potential noncitizens who could be kicked off voting rolls.. Texas officials had just settled a lawsuit in 2019 after a prior search for ineligible voters flagged nearly 100,000 registered voters but wrongly captured naturalized citizens. A federal judge who halted the search the month after it began noted that only about 80 people to that point had been identified as potentially ineligible to vote.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Sheri Biggs wins Republican nod for US House in South Carolina over Trump-backed candidate,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/south-carolina-runoff-pits-trump-candidate-gop-governors-111390525,2024-06-25 21:34:26,"Nurse practitioner and Air National Guard officer Sheri Biggs has won the Republican nomination for the U.S. House in South Carolina’s 3rd District. COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Sheri Biggs, a nurse practitioner and Air National Guard officer, won the Republican nomination for the U.S. House in South Carolina’s 3rd District on Tuesday.. Biggs was backed by Republican Gov. Henry McMaster. She and her husband were longtime friends and financial backers of the governor.. Biggs defeated Mark Burns, a Black pastor who has been by former President Donald Trump’s side for nearly a decade and has unsuccessfully run for Congress twice before.. This was Biggs’ first run for political office and if she wins in November, she will be only the second Republican woman South Carolina has sent to Congress. U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace is still serving for the 1st District.. The seat is open after Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan decided not to run again after seven terms. Duncan’s wife of 35 years filed for divorce in 2023, accusing him of several affairs.. Biggs will face the Democratic nominee, Sherwin-Williams paint store manager Byron Best from Greenwood, and Michael Bedenbaugh, of the Alliance Party, in November. Biggs will be a heavy favorite in the most Republican district in GOP-dominated South Carolina.. The district in the northwest corner of the state contains several small population centers.. While longtime friends Trump and McMaster were on opposite sides, there was no apparent animosity between the endorsers. McMaster did campaign in person for Biggs, while Trump didn’t make a visit to South Carolina for Burns.. McMaster and Trump go back a long way. McMaster was the nation’s first statewide elected official to back Trump in early 2016. Trump said when he became president he asked then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to become U.N. Ambassador so McMaster could move from lieutenant governor to the state’s top job.. Biggs and Burns had similar, popular views for Republicans, like ending nearly all abortions, closing the border and fighting inflation, as well as a total disdain for ideas from Democrats.. Burns won the June 11 primary with 33% of the vote, but Biggs was just a few points behind.. With similar agendas, the two-week sprint to the runoff was more about style. Burns called Biggs a “swamp creature” who wouldn’t fight the establishment. Biggs, who is a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard, said Burns misconstrued his academic and military background and voted for former Democratic President Barack Obama. Biggs has promoted pictures of her taken with Trump and said she is the candidate who can bring people together.. “I want to help heal our nation. We are broken fiscally, mentally and spiritually,” Biggs said at last week’s debate moderated by Fox Carolina.. Both candidates have invested heavily from their own money. Biggs loaned her campaign nearly $350,000 while raising an additional $182,000 from individual donors.. Burns has taken out $500,000 in loans for the 2024 campaign and raised a little over $16,000 from individuals. He still owes a $100,000 loan from an unsuccessful 2022 run in the neighboring 4th District. And unlike Biggs, Burns has not filed a required ethics disclosure form detailing his personal finances, which would give a glimpse into his personal worth and ability to pay the loans back.. “You can check my financial reports,” said Biggs, who lists millions of dollars in assets in investments and businesses with her husband. “I submitted mine unlike my opponent.”. In Lexington County, just west of Columbia, voters are deciding whether the last of the three Republican “Sister Senators,” who helped defeat a near-total abortion ban in South Carolina should be tossed out of office.. The three women were given the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage award for people who risk their careers for the greater good after they joined with Democratic lawmakers last year. The General Assembly eventually passed a measure that would ban most abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy — before most people know they are pregnant.. State Sen. Katrina Shealy finished first in the June 11 primary, but her 40% of the vote was well below the majority needed to win outright. Attorney Carlisle Kennedy was a few percentage points behind.. Shealy, along with fellow Republican Sens. Sandy Senn and Penry Gustafson, said a pregnant woman shouldn’t lose control of her body as soon as an egg is fertilized. Senn lost her primary by 33 votes, while Gustafson got only 18% of the vote.. Outside of a Democratic senator mostly drawn out of his district due to redistricting, the women are the only ones in the 46-seat South Carolina Senate to lose their reelection bids.. “You can’t tell me that’s not a slap in the face of women,” Shealy said of the losses as she geared up for her runoff. “Republican women lose like this over one issue when we fought so hard for other things.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Analysis: Bryson DeChambeau had his chances to make the Olympics,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/analysis-bryson-dechambeau-chances-make-olympics-111421887,2024-06-25 18:07:16,"Bryson DeChambeau will have to settle for being a U.S. Open champion. Bryson DeChambeau is a U.S. Open champion, and for now that will have to do.. He is among the great entertainers in golf, with a YouTube channel approaching 800,000 subscribers. He certainly is among the best players over the last three months. Just look at his record in the majors — a tie for sixth in the Masters, runner-up by one birdie putt in the PGA Championship, conqueror of the toughest test in golf to win the U.S. Open.. His swing speed is faster. His world ranking is climbing higher. His appeal is stronger.. That's as close as DeChambeau gets to being part of the Olympics.. The four Americans heading to the Paris Games are Masters champion Scottie Scheffler, PGA champion Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa and past U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark.. DeChambeau, who started the year at No. 155 in the world ranking and reached No. 10 while playing in only three tournaments, is the second alternate.. “It's disappointing, but I understand the decisions I made,” DeChambeau said.. That decision was to take Saudi riches two years ago to join LIV Golf, a league that has teams and shotgun starts for 54 holes against (mostly) the same 54 players all season. It offers DeChambeau a chance to take his talents around the world, and it affords him time to create content making him as popular as ever.. The Olympics always was going to be a long shot. LIV Golf doesn't offer world ranking points and DeChambeau knew that when he signed up. He was competing against Americans who had a steady diet of big events with big points.. Is there an injustice? Not really.. DeChambeau missing out on the Olympics (again) has nothing to do with the Official World Golf Ranking choosing not to recognize what amounts to a closed shop at LIV Golf. The problem is golf is a sport where the OWGR is the most logical way to determine who plays.. The International Golf Federation — the worldwide governing body for golf — chose to use the world ranking to set the 60-man field when golf returned to the Olympics in 2016.. “It was the best way to determine the top players and balance the strength of field with diversity,” said Antony Scanlon, the IGF executive with a strong background in the Olympics.. The Olympics is not the strongest field because of that diversity, which is bringing players from 32 countries — Switzerland and Malaysia, included — to Le Golf National in early August.. But it's the Olympics. And someone is always going to get left out.. It makes little sense to fill the field based on a tour because each tour has players from all over the world, and the best of the lot are on the PGA Tour. It's been that way for 20 years. LIV has bought its share of big-time players, but how to measure them when it's (mostly) the same 54 was one of the key reasons the OWGR board chose not to give them points.. At the heart of the OWGR decision was measuring them against two dozen other tours that operate nothing like LIV.. Players knew when they signed up for LIV that it would be a tough road. That's why it's worth celebrating David Puig of Spain, who joined LIV out of Arizona State and played the Asian Tour whenever he could to accumulate points.. Joaquin Niemann of Chile did the same, which not only earned him an invitation to the Masters, he did well enough to secure his spot in the Olympics again. Carlos Ortiz won in Oman on the Asian Tour, which helped his cause.. “I’ve done my best up until now to give myself a chance according to the OWGR, but I realize and respect where the current situation of the game is, albeit it’s frustrating and disappointing,” DeChambeau said. “Hopefully 2028 will be a little different situation, and it will make it that much sweeter.”. He played well in the majors. But his best chance? DeChambeau, who missed three straight cuts before joining LIV in June 2022, has played only one tournament outside LIV and the majors over the last two years. Maybe he could have helped his chances by playing an Asian Tour or in Australia. Maybe that's not what he wanted to do, which is fine.. His record in the majors is second to none. On LIV Golf this year, he is 12th in the standings.. Clark has only one top 10 (and two missed cuts) in his last five starts. But golf is measured over time, and he won the Wells Fargo Championship last year and then the U.S. Open, and he shot 60 to win the rain-shortened AT&T Pebble Beach.. Morikawa played in the final group of two majors and has risen from No. 20 to No. 7 in the world since the Masters. Scheffler's and Schauffele's records need no explanation. They earned their spots in Paris.. DeChambeau almost did, and he said all the right things when asked if he should be going to the Olympics. Perhaps it will be different for 2028, suggesting slightly better (or more) results, or even a more equitable OWGR situation with LIV.. “There's another one four years later,” he said.. Then again, DeChambeau knows not to count on that. He was part of the U.S. squad for the Tokyo Games until he tested positive for COVID-19 and never made it to Japan.. ___.

abcnews.com,Utah primaries test Trump's pull in a state that has half-heartedly embraced him,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/utah-primaries-test-trumps-pull-state-half-heartedly-111391076,2024-06-25 20:22:26,"Republican voters in Utah are set to decide whether retiring U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney will be succeeded by someone similarly willing to challenge GOP hard-liners or a farther-right candidate who pledges to fall in line with former President Donald Trump. PROVO, Utah -- Republican voters in Utah will decide on Tuesday whether the state's most famous moderate conservative, retiring U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, will be succeeded by someone similarly willing to challenge GOP hard-liners or a farther-right candidate who pledges to fall in line with former President Donald Trump.. The primary duel between GOP factions will test whether Trump's influence and appeal have grown among Republican voters in Utah, a rare Republican stronghold that half-heartedly embraced the former president in past elections. . A suburban mayor, Trent Staggs, who rode Trump’s endorsement to a GOP convention nomination for Romney's seat, is hoping it will also propel him past U.S. Rep. John Curtis, the more moderate front-runner in Tuesday’s primary.. Curtis has pitched himself as the alternative to Staggs, the mayor Riverton, and two other contenders who have spent much of the race arguing over whose policy positions most closely align with Trump’s. . Curtis, the former mayor of Provo who started out as a county-level Democratic Party official, is the only Republican in the race who has not outright endorsed Trump’s reelection bid. He has been compared to Romney for pushing back against more extreme members of his party, particularly on climate change. . At a polling location in Heber City, tucked between sprawling ranches in the Wasatch Mountains, a steady trickle of voters dropped off their ballots Tuesday afternoon. . Erica Goulding said she voted for Staggs even though she isn't a big fan of Trump. Both Trump and President Joe Biden are “not good people,” she said, and their support for a candidate has little impact on how she votes. The Heber City resident said she decided to back Staggs because he has spoken out against what she considers overregulation, namely the COVID-19 lockdowns, and has a track record of lowering taxes in the suburb he leads.. “Staggs is the true conservative in the race,” Goulding said. “I just want change, not another Mitt Romney.”. Another candidate for the seat, former state House Speaker Brad Wilson, has the financial advantage after loaning his campaign $3 million. He was considered a strong contender before a loss to Staggs at the April convention relegated him to a long shot in the primary. Jason Walton, who has pitched himself as a businessman in the style of Trump, is also running. . Curtis could get a further boost if supporters of the former president split between Staggs, Wilson and Walton.. The Republican primary winner is highly favored to win in November over Democratic nominee Caroline Gleich in a state that has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1970.. Gov. Spencer Cox is also set to face his primary challenger, state Rep. Phil Lyman, on Tuesday. . Cox, a moderate Republican who took office in 2021, is expected to win even after he was booed earlier this year by GOP convention delegates, who tend to lean farther right. Lyman is a former county commissioner turned state legislator who espoused false claims of election fraud following the 2020 presidential election.. Lyman is best known for organizing an illegal ATV ride in 2014 to protest federal officials closing a southeast Utah canyon to motorized vehicles to protect Native American cliff dwellings, artifacts and burial sites. He argued the closure constituted overreach by the federal government. . A judge in 2015 sentenced Lyman to 10 days in jail and three years of probation after a jury found him guilty of misdemeanor illegal use of ATVs and conspiracy. Trump later pardoned him in December 2020.. Retired teachers Russ Olsen and his wife Sandra Olsen said they see land and water rights as the most important issues in Utah. The couple from Heber City voted for Lyman, and for Staggs in the Senate race, because those candidates have promised to fight against the federal government encroaching on Utah's natural resources.. “Lyman would protect the water rights of the individual, rights that are being taken away from us,” Russ Olsen said. “I believe that the federal government really shouldn't be owning state land. It should belong to the states, to the people.”. The winner of the Republican primary for governor is heavily favored to win in November over Democratic nominee Brian King, a state representative.. Also Tuesday, five Republicans are battling for the open 3rd District U.S. House seat that Curtis is vacating to run for Senate. . In Utah's 2nd District, Trump-backed U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy is seeking her first full term on Capitol Hill after winning a special election last fall. She faces challenger Colby Jenkins, a retired U.S. Army officer and telecommunications specialist, who is endorsed by Romney's counterpart, U.S. Sen. Mike Lee.. Primaries will be held Tuesday for other state and national offices, including the 1st District U.S. House seat, attorney general, state auditor, state Senate, state House and state Board of Education.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

ATLANTA -- Four prominent former officials in Georgia, which has been a major front in disinformation over the democratic process, are joining a group that says it will try to counteract efforts to make people distrust elections.. Those joining the Democracy Defense Project, whose launch was announced Tuesday, include two Georgia Republicans, former Gov. Nathan Deal and former U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, and two Democrats, former Gov. Roy Barnes and former Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin.. “For far too long, politicians, pundits and activists have worked overtime to sow distrust in American's electoral process,” Deal said in a statement. “We refuse to sit on the sidelines while the bedrock of this great nation is eroded away by misinformation and dangerous political agendas. Our goal is to restore confidence in the electoral process that makes this country exceptional.”. The four are Georgia board members in a national effort that says it will seek news coverage, as well as raise money to buy advertisements to push back against efforts to undermine elections and try to persuade people to move beyond “polarizing rhetoric.” . The group says it is focusing on states where Democrats and Republicans are competitive in elections. Other board members include three former governors, Republicans Jan Brewer, of Arizona, and Brian Sandoval, of Nevada, as well as Democrat Ed Rendell, of Pennsylvania.. Their announcement comes two days before Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican former President Donald Trump meet for their first debate of the 2024 campaign in Atlanta.. Trump's fellow Republicans, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger drew his ire after the 2020 election for refusing to help him overturn legitimate results that were confirmed by multiple recounts. . The anger that Trump stoked among his supporters has driven continued upheaval in Georgia's politics and election policy. A Republican-majority legislature has made repeated changes in the state's election laws, but local and state election officials still face angry critics demanding that they acknowledge that the 2020 election was stolen and the state's election system is deeply flawed.. The tumult extends far beyond Georgia. Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, continues to sow doubts about the last presidential election and is warning his followers — without citing any evidence — that Democrats will try to cheat in the upcoming one. . Just 22% of Republicans expressed high confidence that votes will be counted accurately in November, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll last year.. A recent survey by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s Law School found that nearly 40% of local election officials had experienced threats or harassment. The abuse has caused many to leave their jobs.. “While it may be politically advantageous to undermine America's core values, it's a harmful, damaging game with lasting consequences for ‘We the People,’” Barnes said in a statement. He was Georgia's most recent Democratic governor, serving from 1999 to 2003.. Chambliss, who was a U.S. senator from 2003 to 2015 and U.S. House member from 1995 to 2003, has been a longtime advocate for Raffensperger and Georgia's election system. He was one of the few Republicans to come forward in the weeks after the 2020 election to defend Raffensperger against Trump's attacks, saying at the time “there is just no widespread fraud.”. The four join others who have banded together to speak up in defense of how American elections are run. That includes a group of Republican election officials coordinated by the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University and the center-right think tank R Street Institute. That group aims to rally Republicans to affirm the security of elections across the United States and to avoid raising doubts about election results in other locales.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,A potential Trump VP pick backs a controversial CO2 pipeline favored by the Biden White House,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/potential-trump-vp-pick-backs-controversial-co2-pipeline-111391078,2024-06-25 10:46:30,"North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is one of Donald Trump’s most visible and vocal backers, sprinting around the country to drum up support for the ex-president’s comeback bid while auditioning to be his running mate. BISMARCK, N.D. -- North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is one of Donald Trump’s most visible and vocal backers, sprinting around the country to drum up support for the former president’s comeback bid while auditioning to be his running mate.. Far from the glare of the campaign trail, however, Burgum is wrestling with a mammoth carbon dioxide pipeline project in his home state. The $5.5 billion venture has split North Dakota and left him straddling an awkward political divide as Trump and President Joe Biden offer voters starkly different visions about how to deal with climate change. . A Republican little known outside North Dakota, Burgum is a serious contender to be Trump’s vice-presidential choice. The two-term governor has stood out in the narrowing field of choices due to his executive experience and business savvy. And Burgum has close ties to deep-pocketed energy industry CEOs whose money Trump wants to help bankroll his third run for the White House.. Burgum is championing the pipeline project, which would gather planet-warming CO2 from ethanol plants across the Midwest and deposit the gas a mile underground. The pipeline aligns with Biden’s push to tackle global climate change, a position that could put him at odds with Trump.. In backing the pipeline, Burgum is navigating the tricky issue of land ownership in deep-red North Dakota and the politics of climate change inside the GOP.. While Burgum has outlined plans to make North Dakota carbon neutral by 2030, he’s steered clear of describing the pipeline or other carbon capture initiatives as environmentally friendly. Instead, he touts them as a lucrative business opportunity for North Dakota that might ultimately assist the fossil fuel industry.. “This has nothing to do with climate change,” Burgum said in early March on a North Dakota radio program. “This has to do with markets.”. The CO2 pipeline, known as the Midwest Carbon Express, is financed by hundreds of investors and will be built by Summit Carbon Solutions of Ames, Iowa. The 2,500-mile pipeline route snakes through Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota before ending in west central North Dakota, where up to 18 million metric tons of CO2 would be entombed each year in underground rock formations.. The North Dakota Industrial Commission, which Burgum chairs, is expected to decide in the coming months whether to approve Summit’s application for a permit to store all the CO2 it collects. Regulators in nearby states are also weighing approval of the pipeline.. As part of Biden’s investment in combating climate change, companies may receive $85 from the federal government for every metric ton of CO2 collected from industrial facilities and permanently sequestered. They can also get $60 for each ton stored and later used to produce more oil, a process that involves injecting carbon dioxide into oilfields to keep them productive.. Summit stands to receive as much as $1.5 billion annually from the tax credits. The company said it has no plans to use CO2 in oil drilling, which is known as enhanced oil recovery, or EOR. But a carbon dioxide storage permit application drafted by Summit appears to leave open the potential for the CO2 to be used for that purpose.. “Our business model is for 100% sequestration,” the company said in an emailed response to questions. “No customers have ever approached us to move their CO2 for EOR.”. For several environmental and public interest groups, providing tax credits for more climate-polluting oil is a handout to oil drillers that upends the goal of weaning corporations and consumers off fossil fuels.. “It’s just not the right answer,” said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity. “You’re incentivizing the extension of the use of fossil fuels for many more years or decades to come.”. Burgum’s office declined a request to interview the governor for this story. He has hailed his state’s underground CO2 storage capacity as a “geologic jackpot.” North Dakota, according to Burgum, has the capacity to store 250 billion tons of carbon dioxide underground.. That message has been amplified by North Dakota’s mineral resources department, which has estimated CO2 can help extract billions more barrels of oil from the rich Bakken shale formation. The Bakken is a 200,000-square-mile deposit that spans North Dakota, Montana and southern Canada.. In North Dakota, the blowback to the Summit project has been intense, with Burgum caught in the crossfire.. There are fears a pipeline rupture would unleash a lethal cloud of CO2. In 2020, a pipeline carrying compressed carbon dioxide ruptured in Satartia, Mississippi. At least 45 people required hospital treatment and 200 more had to be evacuated from the area, according to the federal agency that oversees pipeline safety.. Summit said the CO2 line in Mississippi may have contained high amounts of hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas. Its system will transport nearly pure carbon dioxide, the company said, and any hydrogen sulfide or other elements in the stream “will not be considered impactful.”. Landowners also worry their property values will plummet if the pipeline passes under their property. And they’re outraged over what they allege are hardball tactics employed by Summit to secure easements for the project.. Burgum has largely avoided the dicey subject of eminent domain. If landowners don’t want the pipeline on their property, he’s said, the route can be shifted, and someone else can get the “big check.”. Julia Stramer, whose family owns cropland in Emmons County and opposes the pipeline, said the amount of money Summit offered her for a 99-year easement was insulting.. “I have informed Gov. Burgum that we have not received an offer of ‘the big check,’” she told North Dakota's Public Service Commission earlier this month.. Stramer scoffed at the safety measures Summit says it is taking, telling the commission the pipeline is to be buried only 4 feet deep.. “We bury people deeper than that,” Stramer said.. Kurt Swenson and his family own or have an interest in 1,750 acres at or near the proposed CO2 storage site. At a public hearing earlier this month on Summit's storage permit application, Swenson said he had a warning for anyone who attempts to take his land without his consent.. “It seems like everybody wants what isn’t theirs,” Swenson said. “You’re going to end up taking it from my cold, dead hands. And you’re going to see how that works out for you.”. Summit said it has signed easement deals with landowners along 82% of the pipeline’s route in North Dakota and obtained 92% of the lease agreements needed at the storage site. The company added that the project also is supported by state lawmakers and emergency managers.. Concerns over Summit’s project in North Dakota’s second most populous county, Burleigh, led the county commission to approve an ordinance restricting the pipeline from running too close to residential areas, churches and schools.. “I have not gotten one single contact from anybody that’s not affiliated with Summit asking me to support this pipeline,” said Brian Bitner, the Burleigh County Commission chairman. “Every contact has asked me to oppose it.”. Gaylen Dewing, who has worked as a farmer and rancher near Bismarck for more than 50 years, criticized Burgum for what he sees as the governor’s tilt to the left. Burgum’s embrace of carbon neutrality has put the governor in cahoots with the “Green New Deal people,” he said.. “Although he professes to be a conservative, he is anything but when it comes to environmental issues,” Dewing said.. When he’s out stumping for Trump, Burgum doesn’t sound at all like a climate warrior. . Speaking at the North Carolina Republican Party Convention last month, Burgum accused the Biden administration of trying to shut down the oil and gas industries and declared that Trump would reverse the federal rules and mandates that he said are stifling energy companies.. Trump has long criticized federal and state efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and has been backed by the oil and gas industry in his three presidential bids. The former president, who in the past called global warming a “hoax,” claims on his campaign website that Biden has surrendered to the “crazed climate crusaders.”. Oil and gas interests have already donated nearly $8 million to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, according to the political money website Open Secrets. . Burgum, with his close ties to his state’s dominant industry, is the type of running mate who could help boost such donations.. If Burgum is not selected to be the GOP's vice-presidential nominee and does not take a job in a second Trump administration, he can always return to North Dakota to finish out his last term, with key decisions looming for the pipeline.. ___.

abcnews.com,Laugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/memorable-debate-moments-made-fly-rehearsed-word-uttered-111390526,2024-06-25 11:34:15,"It's debate prep time for President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. WASHINGTON -- It could be a well-rehearsed zinger or an offhand, too-loud sigh.. Notable moments from past presidential debates demonstrate how the candidates' words and body language can make them look especially relatable or hopelessly out-of-touch. They also can showcase candidates at the top of their policy game or suggest they're out to sea. . Will past be prologue when President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump debate in Atlanta on Thursday?. “Debates, being live television events, without a script, without any way of knowing how they are going to evolve — anything can happen,” said Alan Schroeder, author of “Presidential Debates: 50 years of High-Risk TV.”. Here's a look at some standout high moments, low moments and curveballs from presidential debates past.. When everyone knows a sensitive question is coming yet you make the answer sound spontaneous, you're having a good debate. Republican President Ronald Reagan landed a line for the ages in the second presidential debate of 1984 after an underwhelming opening matchup.. Reagan was 73 and seeking a second term in his race against Democratic challenger Walter Mondale, then 56. In the first debate, Reagan struggled to remember facts and occasionally looked befuddled. . One of his top advisers, Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt, suggested afterward that aides “filled his head with so many facts and figures that he lost his spontaneity."". So Reagan's team took a more hands-off approach toward his second faceoff with Mondale. And, when Reagan got a question about his mental and physical stamina that he had to know was coming, he was ready enough to make the response feel unplanned.. “You already are the oldest president in history,” moderator Henry Trewhitt said before asking whether Reagan might not be able to handle a challenge like the Cuban missile crisis.. “Not at all,” Reagan responded in defense of his crisis management smarts. He smoothly continued, “I want you to know that, also, I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.”. Then, capitalizing on years of Hollywood-honed comedic training, the president took a sip of water, giving the audience and even Mondale, who himself cracked up, more time to laugh. Finally, he grinned and left little doubt that he'd rehearsed a response, adding, ""It was Seneca, or it was Cicero, I don’t know which, that said, ‘If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.’”. Years later, Mondale said that while TV viewers saw him laughing, “I think, if you come in close, you’ll see some tears coming down, because I knew he had gotten me there. That was really the end of my campaign that night."" . Reagan thereby proved that even at his age, a candidate could get better over time. And with this year's race pitting 81-year-old Biden against 78-year-old Trump, 73 doesn't seem so old anymore.. Reagan is also remembered for using a light touch to neutralize criticisms from Democratic President Jimmy Carter in a 1980 debate.. When Carter accused him of wanting to cut Medicare, Reagan scolded, “There you go again.” The line worked so well he turned it into something of a trademark rejoinder going forward.. In 1976, Republican President Gerald Ford had a notable moment during his second debate against Carter — and not in a good way. The president declared that there is “no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.” . With Moscow controlling much of that part of the world, moderator Max Frankel responded, “I'm sorry, wha..?” and asked if he'd understood correctly. Ford stood by his answer, then spent days on the campaign trail trying to explain it away. He lost that November.. “The closer the election, the more zingers and important debate lines can matter,” said Aaron Kall, director of the debate program at the University of Michigan. “Not just on who won, or who lost, but how does it affect fundraising, how does it impact the media cycle in coming days and weeks.”. Not all slips of the lip have a devastating impact.. Then-Sen. Barack Obama, in a 2008 Democratic presidential primary debate, dismissively told Hillary Clinton, “You’re likable enough, Hillary.” That haughty answer drew a backlash but Obama recovered.. The same couldn’t be said for the short-lived 2012 Republican White House bid of then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Despite repeated attempts and excruciatingly long pauses, Perry could not remember the third of the three federal agencies he’d promised to shutter if elected. . Finally, he sheepishly muttered, “Oops.” . The Energy Department is what slipped his mind. . Another damaging moment opened the second presidential debate in 1988, when CNN anchor Bernard Shaw pressed Democrat Michael Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, about his opposition to capital punishment with a question that evoked the candidate's wife. . “If Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?” Shaw asked. Dukakis showed little emotion as he responded, “I don’t see any evidence that it’s a deterrent.” . Dukakis later said he wished he'd said that his wife ""is the most precious thing, she and my family, that I have in this world."" . That year's vice presidential debate featured one of the best-remembered, pre-planned one-liners. . When Dan Quayle, the Republican vice presidential nominee and Indiana senator, compared himself to John F. Kennedy while debating Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democrat was ready. He'd studied Quayle's campaigning and seen him invoke Kennedy in the past.. “Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy,” Bentsen began slowly and deliberately, drawing out the moment. “Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy.”. The audience erupted in applause and laughter. Quayle was left to stare straight ahead.. Quayle and George H.W. Bush still easily won the 1988 election. But they lost in 1992 after then-President Bush was caught on camera looking at his watch while Democrat Bill Clinton talked to an audience member during a town hall debate. Some thought it made Bush look bored and aloof.. In another instance of a nonverbal debate miscue, then-Democratic Vice President Al Gore was criticized for a subpar opening 2000 debate performance with Republican George W. Bush in which he repeatedly and very audibly sighed.. During their second, town hall-style debate, Gore moved so close to Bush while the Republican answered one question that Bush finally looked over and offered a confident nod, drawing laughter from the audience.. A similar moment occurred in 2016, as Hillary Clinton faced the audience to answer questions during her second debate with Trump. The Republican candidate moved in close behind her, narrowed his eyes and glowered. . Clinton offered no visible reaction then, but later wrote of the incident, ""He was literally breathing down my neck. My skin crawled.”. Thursday’s faceoff will be the first time a current president debates a former.. Historically, incumbents sometimes struggle during opening debates. They're used to being surrounded by White House advisers who offer little pushback. In 2012, then-President Obama’s seemingly detached first debate performance against Mitt Romney allowed the Republican to gain momentum.. Romney, though, had an awkward moment during the second debate. . Answering a question about gender pay equity, the former Massachusetts governor talked about going to women's groups to get help finding qualified female applicants for top state posts. . ""They brought us whole binders full of women,” he declared. Obama turned that into an attack line at subsequent rallies, gleefully saying, “We don't have to collect a bunch of binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women.”. If Biden's debate skills are rusty this time, his opponent's might be as well. Trump skipped all the GOP primary debates this time, meaning he’s not done one since squaring off with Biden twice in 2020. . Trump interrupted so frequently when they first debated four years ago that Biden eventually cried out, “Will you shut up, man?” — a visceral moment if there ever was one. Trump is remembered that night for instructing members of the far-right Proud Boys group from the stage to “stand back and stand by.” Some members of the extremist group took it as a sign of encouragement.. The second Biden-Trump debate of 2020 saw producers cut the mics to discourage interrupting, making it less chaotic. It featured Biden wistfully declaring, “I am anxious to have this race. I’m anxious to see this take place.”. It did. And now it's happening again. . ___.

abcnews.com,"California governor defends progressive values, says they're an 'antidote' to populism on the right",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/california-gov-gavin-newsom-defends-californias-progressive-values-111411530,2024-06-25 15:50:26,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom has used his State of the State address to defend California's progressive values ahead of a pivotal presidential debate. SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Gov. Gavin Newsom used his State of the State address on Tuesday to boost President Joe Biden ahead of Thursday's pivotal presidential debate, comparing Donald Trump's version of the Republican Party to the rise of fascism prior to World War II and offering Democrats' ideals as “an antidote to the poisonous populism of the right.”. Nowhere in Newsom's speech — which was prerecorded and posted online to his social media channels in a departure from decades of tradition — did he mention Trump or Biden by name. But he used some of Trump's most incendiary statements to offer a dark contrast of the choice facing Americans in November, comparing it to the eve of World War II when “fascism spread its hate and destruction throughout Europe.”. “When they speak of immigrants poisoning American blood, and of mass deportations and detention camps, this is the language of destruction — of 1939,” Newsom said. . Trump made those comments about immigrants “poisoning the blood of our country” during a campaign rally in Iowa last year, later saying he did not know that Adolf Hitler had once said something similar. Still, the comments have become a key talking point for the left as they paint Trump's candidacy as a warning for a dark future.. The political tone of Newsom's speech was not surprising given his role as one of the Biden campaign's top surrogates, which has made him a target of Republicans who have repeatedly held up California as an example of Democrats' mismanagement. They have pointed to the state's $46.8 billion budget deficit, high tax rates, large homeless population and the proliferation of property crimes in its largest cities — acts which have been captured in viral social media clips.. Much of Newsom's speech was devoted to pushing back against that narrative, referring to “delusional California bashers” whose “success depends on our failure.” He noted California's violent crime rate is about half of what it was at its peak in 1992. He said property crime in San Francisco has fallen as has the overall crime rate across the bay in Oakland — where Newsom recently deployed 120 California Highway Patrol officers.. “This is because in California, we take public safety seriously. We take it as a problem to solve, not just to flog on cable news,” he said. “While it’s true that California has among the toughest felony theft thresholds in the nation, we will do more to go after professional theft rings more forcefully.”. On homelessness, Newsom pointed to the more active role the state has taken under his administration, including spending billions of dollars to create programs that provided 15,300 units of housing and provided shelter for more than 71,000 people. But a state audit released earlier this year chided his administration for not tracking how effective the state's homelessness spending — more than $24 billion over five years — has been.. Newsom defended his decision to sign a law raising the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 an hour, a raise that businesses have blamed for increasing customer costs. And he boasted about California's economy that, were it an independent country, would rank as the fifth largest in the world — saying California has added 63,000 new millionaires since 2019. . “Here is a simple question for Republicans: If California is a failed state, why are four of the seven most valuable companies in the world based here?” he said, referring to Apple, Nvidia, and the parent companies of Google and Facebook. “The best minds in the world call California home because they’re liberated from the constraints of conformity and tradition. This is true freedom — to invent and make the world a better place.” . Newsom's speech comes a few weeks after a statewide survey from the Public Policy Institute of California found 59% of likely voters believed California is headed in the wrong direction while 52% disapprove of the way Newsom is handling his job as governor. The survey was based on responses from 1,098 likely voters with a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.. Republicans criticized Newsom for not giving a public speech, holding their own in-person rebuttal on the steps of the state Capitol about an hour after Newsom’s speech started on social media. James Gallagher, the Republican leader of the state Assembly, called Newsom “defensive” and “unhinged.”. “To sit here and talk about venture capitalists when the majority of Californians are struggling, to me, is tone deaf,” Gallagher said. “It was not a real addressing of the problems that Californians are facing.”. Newsom chose to deliver a speech for the smartphone era, opting to upload a prerecorded video across his social media channels instead of delivering a formal speech before a packed house of state lawmakers.. The Democratic governor, now in his second term, has never been a big fan of formal speeches, given the difficulty his dyslexia gives him while reading from a teleprompter in live time. Last year, Newsom skipped the speech entirely, instead embarking on a statewide tour to announce a series of major policy proposals in a more informal setting that allowed for questions from reporters.. California's Constitution requires the governor to update the Legislature every year “on the condition of the state.” Prior to World War II, California governors would do this by sending a letter to the Legislature. That changed with Gov. Earl Warren — the future chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court — who decided to give a formal speech to the Legislature.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Washington high court to decide if Seattle officers who attended Jan. 6 rally can remain anonymous,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/washington-high-court-decide-seattle-officers-attended-jan-111420458,2024-06-25 16:30:39,"The Washington Supreme Court is considering a case that will determine whether the names of four Seattle police officers who attended events in Washington, D. The Washington Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a case that will determine whether the names of four Seattle police officers who attended events in the nation’s capital on the day of the insurrection are protected under the state's public records law and whether an investigation into their activities should be made public. . The officers say they did nothing wrong and revealing their names would violate their privacy, but those seeking disclosure say the officers' attendance at a widely covered public demonstration that drew thousands on Jan. 6, 2021, was not a private activity.. The justices must also decide whether agencies that handle public records requests must consider a person's Constitutional rights before releasing documents — a new standard created by an appeals court ruling in this case. . When then-Seattle Police Chief Adrian Diaz learned that six of his officers traveled to Washington, D.C., to attend former President Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally, he ordered the Office of Police Accountability to conduct an investigation into their activities to see if they violated any laws or department policies. . The investigation found that married officers Caitlin and Alexander Everett crossed barriers set up by the Capitol police and were next to the Capitol Building, in violation of the law, prompting Diaz to fire the pair. Investigators said three other officers had not violated policies and the fourth case was ruled “inconclusive.”. Sam Sueoka, a law student at the time, filed a Public Records Act request for the OPA investigation. The officers, filing under the pseudonym John Doe 1-5, filed a request for a preliminary injunction to stop their release. . The trial court twice denied their request, but the appeals court ruled in the officers' favor on the second appeal, saying the agency handling the records must consider a person's First Amendment rights before granting disclosure. That's a different standard than considering a privacy exemption under state laws. . The City of Seattle and others objected, saying government agencies that handle records requests would be burdened by this new standard. Jessica Leiser, a Seattle assistant city attorney, told the justices that the appeals court ruling changed the way agencies must review records requests by adding an extra review to see if any Constitutional rights would be violated by releasing the documents. . The Public Records Act already includes a level of protection by allowing agencies to notify a person if their records are requested. At that point, the person can take legal action to protect their own Constitutional rights. It should not be up to the agency to make that determination, she said. . “If the legislature had intended to require agencies to independently assert third-party rights, it could have easily said so,” Leiser said. “Likewise, if the legislature had intended to create separate procedural processes for judicial review of constitutional exemptions, it could have done so.”. Justice G. Helen Whitener asked Neil Fox, Sueoka's attorney, whether a person who attends a rally automatically gives up their right to privacy.. “My concern is this country is built on dissent, and that’s done through protesting and for marginalized populations, many of which I belong to, this is how individuals literally effectuated changes,” she said. If participating in rallies means you give up your privacy, “what you’re doing is chilling an individual’s ability to participate in what is supposed to be a constitutionally protected event.”. Fox said the officers’ names have already been made public through social media, but they have not been fired or suffered harassment or attacks. In order to claim a First Amendment anonymity protection, Fox argued that the officers must show they would suffer harm. He said that after two years of litigation, no harm has been inflicted and therefore their names should be on the court records.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Parliament speaker. The Tehran mayor. A heart surgeon. The race is on for Iran's next president,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/parliament-speaker-tehran-mayor-heart-surgeon-race-irans-111393254,2024-06-25 17:34:29,"Six candidates have been approved by Iran’s theocracy to run in Friday’s presidential election to replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash with several other officials in May. Six candidates have been approved by Iran's theocracy to run in Friday’s presidential election to replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash with several other officials in May.. Among them, Iran’s parliament speaker stands out as the most recognizable figure. A little-known politician and heart surgeon is also on the ballot. He is the only reformist while the others are more skewed toward hard-liners who back Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei without question and challenge the West. . And if previous elections are a guide to Iranian politics, several candidates could drop out in the final days before the vote to coalesce around a unity candidate. . On Tuesday, Khamenei called for “maximum” voter turnout in the election, which analysts say could support the reformist candidate. A parliamentary election in Iran earlier this year saw the lowest turnout since the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution. . Here's a look at the candidates:. Ghazizadeh Hashemi, 53, served as one of Raisi’s vice presidents and as the head of the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs. He ran in the 2021 presidential election and received just under 1 million votes, coming in last place. In debates so far, he's urged the country to continue to follow the policies of Raisi and insisted that Iran does not need foreign investment to succeed, despite the widespread economic challenges the nation now faces. . The 58-year-old Jaili is a hard-line politician and former senior nuclear negotiator. He ran in Iran's 2013 presidential election and registered in 2021 before withdrawing to support Raisi. Current CIA director Bill Burns, who dealt with Jalili in negotiations in the past, has described him as “stupefyingly opaque” in talks. He got the nickname “The Living Martyr” after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war. He maintains that Iran doesn't need to negotiate over its nuclear program with the West. Though he is seen as maintaining close ties to Khamenei, he's not considered to be a front-runner. His campaign largely has focused on rural voters.. A 69-year-old heart surgeon, Pezeshkian is the only reformist candidate among the hard-line figures seeking the presidency. He's said he'd want to renegotiate with the West to try and restart some version of the 2015 nuclear deal. He's put the need for the deal in economic terms, saying Iran needs to communicate with the world. Iran's former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who served under the relative-moderate President Hassan Rouhani and helped strike the nuclear deal, has backed him. However, analysts believe Pezeshkian would need a heavy turnout to win — which is unlikely, given the current apathy gripping the nation. His campaign has so far focused on the youth vote, women and Iran's ethnic minorities.. Pourmohammadi, 64, is the only Shiite cleric running in the election. He served as interior minister under hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and later as justice minister under Rouhani. In 2006, the United States State Department referred to Pourmohammadi as a “notorious human rights violator” for a leading role in the 1988 mass execution of several thousand political prisoners at Tehran's notorious Evin prison. The State Department also linked him to the so-called “chain murders” of activists and others in the 1990s. He's insisted the next president must deal with the world and criticized Iran's arming of Russia in the war in Ukraine — not because of the killing of civilians, but because he felt Tehran wasn't getting enough back from Moscow for its support. His campaign likely is counting on the backing of clerics and traditionalists.. The Iranian parliament speaker, Qalibaf, 62, is the highest-ranking official within the theocracy to be seeking the presidency. Analysts suggest he's the front-runner in the campaign, with Jalili as a second. Qalibaf is a former Tehran mayor with close ties to the country’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Many remember that Qalibaf — as a former Guard general — was part of a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against students in 2003 while serving as the country’s police chief. Qalibaf maintains that he, as a strong manager, can save Iran from the crisis, borrowing from recent comments made by Khamenei. Qalibaf has focused on the middle class, as well as promising more cash handouts for the poor.. The current mayor of Tehran, Zakani, 58, withdrew from the 2021 presidential election to back Raisi. Zakani has said he believes Iran can neutralize the effects of international sanctions but should pursue a diplomatic solution. He is a hard-liner who has repeatedly criticized reformists and moderates within Iran's political system, wants to see Iran stop using the dollar as a benchmark currency, and has called for Iran to create more value-added products from its oil to boost revenue. He has promised free health care for women and old people, as well as cash payments to poor people and reviving Iran's currency, the rial. However, he's offered no details on how he plans to accomplish these goals. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,Trump lawyers in classified docs case ask judge to suppress evidence seized during Mar-a-Lago search,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-lawyers-classified-documents-case-judge-suppress-evidence-111397323,2024-06-25 16:38:25,"Lawyers for Donald Trump are asking the judge presiding over his classified documents case to prevent prosecutors from using as evidence boxes of records seized during an FBI search of his Florida estate. FORT PIERCE, Fla. -- Lawyers for Donald Trump on Tuesday asked the judge presiding over his classified documents case to prevent prosecutors from using as evidence boxes of records seized during an FBI search of his Florida estate. . The arguments marked the conclusion of a three-day hearing in which prosecutors and defense lawyers have sparred over topics ranging from the legality of the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, whose team brought the case, to whether the Republican former president should be barred from making comments that could pose a risk to the safety of FBI agents involved in the investigation.. Trump faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach and obstructing government efforts to get them back. He has pleaded not guilty.. At issue Tuesday was a defense request to suppress the boxes of records that were taken from Mar-a-Lago during the Aug. 8, 2022, FBI search. Defense lawyers contend that the application that the Justice Department submitted to a judge to obtain a warrant to search the property omitted key facts and provided misleading information, in part because it did not include details of internal Justice Department debate about whether the search of the property was an appropriate step.. One of Trump's lawyers, Emil Bove, also told the judge that the warrant permitted an overly expansive search of the sprawling estate, allowing for Trump's personal papers to be seized in addition to documents with classified markings. He asked for what's known in the law as a Franks hearing to further argue that the warrant application was defective and that the resulting evidence should be suppressed,. “The overbreadth of that search violated President Trump's rights,” Bove said.. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee whose handling of the case has generated intense scrutiny, did not immediately rule but expressed repeated skepticism of his lawyers' arguments and signaled that she was not inclined side with them.. Prosecutor David Harbach said that there was nothing misleading about the warrant application and that none of the defense objections had any bearing on whether or not the investigators who applied for the warrant had identified probable cause that a crime had occurred, the legal standard. . He suggested that it was reasonable for agents to have conducted a broad search of the property given the unconventional locations, including a restroom, where records were kept.. “There's nothing about it that remotely even touches on the whether there was probable cause in this case,” Harbach said.. On Monday, Cannon appeared deeply skeptical of a prosecution request to make as a condition of Trump's freedom pending trial a requirement that he avoid comments that might pose a risk to law enforcement officials involved in the case. The judge had a tense exchange with Harbach during those arguments, telling him at one point that she didn't appreciate his tone. He later apologized.. Tuesday's hearing ended on another fractious note when Harbach attempted to complain to the judge about a defense strategy that he said was resulting in needless delays, saying Trump's attorneys had made an “attempt to hijack the hearing” with baseless claims. . That's a sensitive subject given that Cannon's willingness to entertain assorted Trump team motions and her plodding pace in issuing rulings has contributed to a delay that has made a trial — which had been scheduled to begin last month before being indefinitely postponed — before the November presidential election a virtual impossibility.. “There's no hijacking going on,” she replied tersely. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Arizona authorities are investigating theft of device that allows access to vote tabulators,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/arizona-authorities-investigating-theft-device-allows-access-vote-111423300,2024-06-25 19:10:25,"Authorities are investigating whether a 27-year-old temporary election worker had political motivations when he stole a fob that allows access to vote tabulators in Arizona's largest county. PHOENIX -- Arizona authorities on Tuesday said they were investigating whether a 27-year-old temporary election worker in the state's largest county had political motivations when he stole a fob that would allow him access to vote tabulators just before the July 30 primary.. “This is not your average theft,” Maricopa County Sheriff Russ Skinner said at a news conference in Phoenix, adding that he had no information yet on the suspect's beliefs.. Skinner said authorities were reviewing Walter Ringfield's social media feeds and phone to determine whether he was working with anyone when he took the small black fob that allows access to the tabulators used in the county, which has been the subject of election conspiracy theories ever since President Joe Biden narrowly beat former President Donald Trump in the state four years ago.. Trump falsely claimed there was massive fraud in Maricopa, leading to Republican lawmakers launching an error-riddled review of the ballot count and a long string of threats against the local GOP officials who stood by their staff's tallies. As the county geared up for the primary — in which the Republican county recorder and a Republican county supervisors are being challenged by election conspiracy theorists — it hired more than 2,000 temporary workers to help with the election.. Ringfield was one of them. On Thursday, according to a statement from the sheriff's office, surveillance footage showed Ringfield taking one of the fobs from a desk shortly after 5 p.m. He was arrested at his Phoenix home the next day after election workers realized that one of the fobs was missing, authorities said.. Ringfield told the sheriff's department he took the fob because he was trying to help clean up. He also said he had hoped to get a permanent position in the elections office, according to the agency's statement. The public defender’s office said a lawyer had not yet been assigned to represent Ringfield.. Skinner and Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates said election officials reprogrammed the tabulators to make sure they could not be accessed by the fob and then conducted a new test of the counting equipment to make sure it worked, with observers from both major parties. A Republican, Gates stressed that the incident shows the security of the county's operation.. “The suspect was arrested the day we determined it was missing,” Gates said. “This incident has shown all of the protocols that are in place. We have cameras. We have observers.”. Alluding to the years of turmoil around elections in the county, Gates added: “I certainly hope people don't take this incident to spin up further conspiracy theories.”. The Republican National Committee in a statement said it dispatched staff to Maricopa in response to the incident. The party's election integrity operation is led by Christina Bobb, an attorney and former reporter for a conservative news network who promoted the conspiratorial review of the 2020 election in the county.. ""This incident raises serious questions about election security in Arizona that must be answered –- we will be constructively engaged with Maricopa County officials to ensure that the remedies to this security breach sufficiently address our concerns,” RNC chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,This week's televised debate is crucial for Biden and Trump — and for CNN as well,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/weeks-televised-debate-crucial-biden-trump-cnn-111391072,2024-06-25 04:06:16,"The stakes are high for Joe Biden and Donald Trump for Thursday's first presidential debate. NEW YORK -- Joe Biden and Donald Trump won't be alone at Thursday's debate. Moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper of CNN will be on camera, too, and there's a lot on the line for their network as it fights for relevance in a changing media environment.. CNN has hosted dozens of town halls and political forums through the years, but never a general election presidential debate, let alone one so early in a campaign. No network has.. “This is a huge moment for CNN,” said former CNN Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno, now a media and public affairs professor at George Washington University. “CNN has to reassert itself. It has to show that it led a revolution in news before and can do it again.”. As a television network, CNN is struggling at a time many consumers are cutting off cable and most news outlets wonder if the campaign will ignite consumer interest.. Those that remain have expressed a clear preference for opinion programming. Fox News Channel has averaged 2.14 million viewers in prime time this month, with MSNBC at 1.22 million and CNN at 525,000, according to the Nielsen company. That's down 17% from last June for CNN.. CNN's chairman and CEO, Mark Thompson, has been with the company for less than a year and has spoken more about the internet than television as an opportunity for growth. Yet it means something that both campaigns chose CNN for the first debate. A well-run, illuminating event can open some eyes and remind people of CNN's legacy as the first all-news television network. If it goes off the rails, that's a stain that could take years to wash away.. “This is a hugely consequential moment in this campaign,” said David Chalian, CNN's vice president and political director. “It's the earliest presidential debate ever. It's obviously a huge privilege and a huge responsibility for CNN to host it.”. It's possible — even likely — that CNN won't even have the biggest American audience on Thursday. . Choosing public service over pure profit, CNN offered to let other networks carry the debate feed; ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, PBS and C-SPAN will all do so. The other networks also have the right to sell their own ad time during the two commercial breaks.. The networks had to agree to CNN's rules — they must keep CNN's insignia onscreen and can't interrupt with their own commentators while the debate airs. Internationally, only CNN is carrying it.. The event, in an Atlanta studio, won't have a live audience. That was important to the Biden campaign but also to CNN. The network's town hall with Trump in 2023 was panned in large part because of the presence of Trump partisans.. CNN will also control a mute button, to turn a candidate’s microphone off when his opponent is talking. That's also reactive; Biden and many viewers were frustrated by Trump's frequent interruptions during the first of two debates between them in 2020. . When he conducted an unscientific poll among listeners to his SiriusXM radio show, Michael Smerconish said that 90% were in favor of the “mute” button. But Smerconish, who also hosts a weekend show on CNN, counts himself among the 10% who don't like the idea.. “You run the risk that the debate will become an antiseptic experience,” missing some good give-and-take, Smerconish said in an interview with The Associated Press.. Stay tuned, though. Chalian, who would not say who would be in control of the mute button, said an opponent's voice may still be picked up if he pipes up. It just won't be the dominant voice.. The network will not attempt to fact-check the candidates in real time, he said.. “Obviously, if there is some egregious fact that needs to be checked or the record needs to be made clear, Jake and Dana can do that,” he said. “But that's not their role. They are not here to participate in this debate. They are here to facilitate a debate between Trump and Biden.”. Well before the debate, Trump and his supporters have been putting forward the notion that because of CNN's presence, it won't be a fair fight. At a campaign rally where he denounced “fake Tapper,” Trump said that he would be debating three people instead of one — even though his campaign agreed in advance to the rules and moderators.. On CNN Monday, the network's Kasie Hunt cut off an interview with Trump press aide Karoline Leavitt after she repeatedly attacked the moderators.. “Our side has zero expectations that this is going to be a fair debate,” said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center. “When you watch Tapper and Bash anchor, you get the distinct impression that you're not going to get a fair debate.”. What Graham will be watching for: How many times will the moderators interrupt Trump and how many times do they stop Biden?. To a large extent, the attitude speaks to how CNN is boxed in commercially. Egged on by Trump, many of his supporters perceive CNN as biased against them, not as a network that follows the facts. And if you oppose Trump and want to see your view reflected, MSNBC is a more satisfying destination.. “Our job is simply to make sure that we are best prepared to facilitate and moderate the debate between the candidates,” Chalian said. ""That is our focus. I really try not to pay too much attention to the pre-spin or post-spin. I'm really focused on the debate itself.”. Days before the event, a keep-your-head-down-and-work attitude seems to be how he's dealing with a pressure-filled event that could choke you if you let it.. “Let's be clear,” he said. “The stakes are highest for Donald Trump and Joe Biden. They're the participants in this debate.”. ___. David Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press. Follow him at http://twitter.com/dbauder.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

abcnews.com,Who is Julian Assange and why is the embattled WikiLeaks founder now on the verge of freedom?,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/julian-assange-long-jailed-wikileaks-founder-now-verge-111391895,2024-06-25 16:30:33,"News that the U.S. Justice Department has reached a plea deal with Julian Assange brings a stunning culmination to a long-running saga of international intrigue that spanned multiple continents and has had as its central character a quixotic internet p.... WASHINGTON -- A plea deal with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will bring a stunning conclusion to an international saga of the quixotic hacker who exposed government secrets.. The deal reached with the U.S. Justice Department will lead to freedom for Assange after spending 12 years either in self-exile or prison.. A look at Assange, the case and the latest developments:. An Australian editor and publisher, he is best known for having founded the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, which gained massive attention — and notoriety — for the 2010 release of almost half a million documents relating to the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.. His activism made him a cause célèbre among press freedom advocates who said his work in exposing U.S. military misconduct in foreign countries made his activities indistinguishable from what traditional journalists are expected to do as part of their jobs. . But those same actions put him in the crosshairs of American prosecutors, who released an indictment in 2019 that accused Assange — holed up at the time in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London — of conspiring with an Army private to illegally obtain and publish sensitive government records.. “Julian Assange is no journalist,” John Demers, the then-top Justice Department national security official, said at the time. “No responsible actor, journalist or otherwise, would purposely publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in war zones, exposing them to the gravest of dangers.”. Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006 as a place to post confidential documents exposing corruption and revealing secret government workings behind warfare and spying.. It has gone well beyond that, though, in publishing everything from Church of Scientology records to Sarah Palin’s emails to a membership list of the far-right British National Party.. It released more than 570,000 pages of messages sent on Sept. 11, 2001, that showed users frantically trying to reach loved ones near the World Trade Center or warning them not to go downtown after jets struck the towers.. In 2008, a federal judge in San Francisco briefly shuttered the site after a Swiss bank accused it of posting stolen account information. The judge reversed the decision just over a week later after protests by free-speech advocates and news media organizations.. The site — and Assange — became best known in 2010 with the release of the classified U.S. military information, including chilling footage from an Apache helicopter showing people being gunned down in Baghdad as American airmen can be heard laughing about the “dead bastards.” Two Reuters journalists were among the dead and the wounded included children.. The Trump administration’s Justice Department accused Assange of directing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history. . The charges relate to WikiLeaks’ publication of thousands of leaked military and diplomatic documents, with prosecutors accusing Assange of helping Manning steal classified diplomatic cables that they say endangered national security and of conspiring together to crack a Defense Department password.. Reports from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq published by Assange included the names of Afghans and Iraqis who provided information to American and coalition forces, prosecutors said, while the diplomatic cables he released exposed journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates and dissidents in repressive countries.. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison after being convicted of violating the Espionage Act and other offenses for leaking classified government and military documents to WikiLeaks. President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017, allowing her release after about seven years behind bars. . Assange has spent the last five years in a British high-security prison, fighting to avoid extradition to the U.S. and winning favorable court rulings that have delayed any transfer across the Atlantic.. He was evicted in April 2019 from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he had sought refuge seven years earlier amid an investigation by Swedish authorities into claims of sexual misconduct that he has long denied and that was later dropped. The South American nation revoked the political asylum following the charges by the U.S. government.. Despite his arrest and imprisonment by British authorities, extradition efforts by the U.S. had stalled prior to the plea deal.. A U.K. judge rejected the U.S. extradition request in 2021 on the grounds that Assange was likely to kill himself if held under harsh U.S. prison conditions. Higher courts overturned that decision after getting assurances from the U.S. about his treatment. The British government signed an extradition order in June 2022.. Then, last month, two High Court judges ruled that Assange can mount a new appeal based on arguments about whether he will receive free-speech protections or be at a disadvantage because he is not a U.S. citizen. The date of the hearing has yet to be determined.. Assange will have to plead guilty to a felony charge under the Espionage Act of conspiring to unlawfully obtain and disseminate classified information relating to the national defense of the United States, according to a Justice Department letter filed in federal court.. Rather than face the prospect of prison time in the U.S., he is expected to return to Australia after his plea and sentencing. Those proceedings are scheduled for Wednesday morning, local time in Saipan, the largest island in the Mariana Islands.. The hearing is taking place there because of Assange’s opposition to traveling to the continental U.S. and the court’s proximity to Australia.. On Monday evening, he left a British prison ahead of a court hearing expected to result in his release.. It's not, but beyond his interactions with Manning, Assange is well-known for the role WikiLeaks played in the 2016 presidential election, when it released a massive tranche of Democratic emails that federal prosecutors say were stolen by Russian intelligence operatives.. The goal, officials have said, was to harm the electoral effort of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and boost her Republican challenger Donald Trump, who famously said during the campaign: “WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks.”. Assange was not charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the investigation nonetheless painted an unflattering role of WikiLeaks in advancing what prosecutors say was a brazen campaign of Russian election interference.. Assange denied in a Fox News interview that aired in January 2017 that Russians were the source of the hacked emails, though those denials are challenged by a 2018 indictment by Mueller of 12 Russian military intelligence officers.. ___.

abcnews.com,Judge allows disabled voters in Wisconsin to electronically vote from home,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/judge-allows-disabled-voters-wisconsin-electronically-vote-home-111409722,2024-06-25 16:54:27,"A Wisconsin judge is allowing disabled voters in the crucial swing state to vote electronically from home this fall. MADISON, Wis. -- Local election officials in battleground state Wisconsin will be allowed to send absentee ballots to disabled voters electronically in November's presidential election, a judge ruled Tuesday.. Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell issued a temporary injunction that allows voters who self-certify that they can't read or mark a paper ballot without help to request absentee ballots electronically from local clerks. The voters can then cast their ballots at home using devices that help them read and write independently. They will still be required to mail the ballots back to the clerks or return them in person, the same as any other absentee voter in the state.. The injunction is part of a larger lawsuit that Disability Rights Wisconsin, the League of Women Voters and four disabled voters filed in April. The plaintiffs argued in the filing that many people with disabilities can't cast paper ballots without assistance, compromising their right to cast a secret ballot, and struggle to return ballots through the mail or in-person.. “While we expect the decision to be appealed, this is an exciting day for Plaintiffs and other voters with print disabilities who have been fighting for the dignity of voting like everyone else: privately and independently,” Debra Conmiller, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, said in a statement.. Any eligible voter can vote by paper absentee ballot in Wisconsin. Anyone could request an absentee ballot electronically until 2011, when then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a Republican-authored law that allowed only military and overseas voters to use that method.. Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, opposes allowing disabled voters to request electronic absentee ballots. His lawyers argued during a hearing on Monday that state election officials don't have time before November to train Wisconsin's roughly 1,800 local clerks in how to handle electronic ballot requests from disabled voters and create ballots that can interact with the voters' assistive devices. They warned the move would only create confusion and raise security risks.. The plaintiffs countered that an electronic ballot delivery system already exists for military and overseas voters and disabled voters deserve the same treatment. They also have a constitutional right to cast a secret ballot, they maintained.. More than 30 states allow certain voters to return their ballots either by fax, email or an online portal, according to data collected by the National Conference of State Legislatures and Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that studies state voting systems. The method has expanded in recent years to include disabled voters in a dozen states. Experts have warned, however, that electronic ballot return carries risks of ballots being intercepted or manipulated and should be used sparingly.. The plaintiffs' lawsuit requests that Mitchell let disabled voters in Wisconsin return their absentee ballots electronically, an accommodation no other absentee voter in the state is permitted. They did not include that ask in their request for the injunction after Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe testified the set-up would take months and present technical issues, but the demand remains in play as the judge considers the merits of the case going forward. . State Justice Department spokesperson Gillian Drummond had no immediate comment on the injunction.. Questions over who can cast absentee ballots and how have become a political flashpoint in Wisconsin, where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by less than a percentage point. . People with disabilities make up about a quarter of the U.S. adult population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A little more than a million Wisconsin adults, or one in four, are disabled, defined by the CDC as having difficulty with mobility, cognition, independent living, hearing, seeing, dressing or bathing. . Disabled people have engaged in several legal battles in recent years over access to the polls, as many Republican-led states have restricted how and when people can vote. Among the issues they have fought are limits on the types of assistance a voter can receive and whether someone else can return a voter’s mailed ballot.. Nearly 100,000 Wisconsin adults suffer from vision difficulties, according to statistics compiled by state health officials. A little more than 307,000 adults have difficulty moving, including difficulty walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting or carrying things. . Doug Poland, one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, said he has no estimates of how many disabled people who haven't voted in the past because they couldn't fill out absentee ballots on their own may vote in November thanks to the injunction. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

RENO, Nev. -- Supporters of a proposed constitutional amendment that would require voters to show photo identification at the polls have turned in signatures as part of an effort to get the proposal on the 2024 ballot.. The Repair the Vote political action committee submitted about 179,000 signatures to state and county election officials for review, the organization said Monday. Just over 100,000 signatures need to be valid for the measure to be eligible for the ballot.. The measure would then have to be approved by voters in November and again in 2026 to amend the Nevada Constitution.. Along with the photo identification requirement, the initiative also calls for an extra layer of verification for mail ballots, such as the last four digits of a driver’s license or Social Security number.. “By requiring voter identification, we aim to strengthen the integrity of our elections and ensure that every vote counts,” said David Gibbs, the chairman of the PAC in a statement.. Voter ID has been a contentious issue in the Western swing state, particularly in its split-party government. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo outlined it as one of his main priorities last year, but Democrats who control the state Legislature refused to give the issue a hearing.. The Nevada Supreme Court last month ruled unanimously that signatures could be gathered for the ballot initiative. The ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed in December by a member of the progressive immigrant advocacy group Make the Road Nevada that sought to block the initiative. The high court said the proposal would not amount to an unfunded mandate and was descriptive enough to inform voters of its effect.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,US Rep. Lauren Boebert wins Republican House primary after switching districts in Colorado,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/boebert-faces-election-tuesday-switching-districts-vaping-scandal-111390530,2024-06-25 21:42:29,"U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado has won the Republican primary in a U.S. House race that she jumped into last year after switching districts. DENVER -- U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert won the Republican primary in a U.S. House race that she jumped into last year, surviving a scandal over a video of her at a Denver theater and accusations of carpetbagging after fleeing what could have been a tough reelection bid in her current district. . Boebert built national hard-line conservative stardom through a take-no-prisoners political style in the House. That clout likely made it easier for her to weather the scandals of the last year, which included the video of her vaping and causing a disturbance at a musical production of “Beetlejuice.” . Boebert beat a group of homegrown primary candidates who had far less name recognition and generally less combative political styles. . She is expected to win the November general election in the 4th District, which is a dark shade of red and tilted heavily toward former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. . Boebert said she made the switch to ensure another Republican could win her old district, which she nearly lost in 2022, and she blamed outside groups for targeting her. But she had already become a fundraising magnet for the district's likely Democratic candidate, who has pulled in millions that may help him flip a seat that has leaned Republican in recent years.. Boebert entered her election night party in the evening toting a pair of reflective gold sneakers sold by former President Donald Trump and a white “Make America Great Again” hat with Trump's signature etched across the bill.. Her opponents in the primary were more traditional rivals including former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg; current state Reps. Mike Lynch and Richard Holtorf; and parental rights advocate Deborah Flora. . While the theater incident and Boebert's district jump rattled some Republicans, Gilbert Kendzior, 68, a voter in Boebert's new district, shrugged them off, asking “who's perfect?”. Kendzior said he voted for the congresswoman because she shakes things up. “It's gotten too staid. Same promises, nothing happens,” he said. “We need to get rid of the old farts.”. Boebert is expected to also win the November general election in the 4th Congressional District, which sweeps across a wide expanse of ranches, ghost towns and conservative parts of the Denver metro area that make up much of the plains of eastern Colorado. Its voters overwhelmingly backed Trump in the 2020 election.. The seat opened up after former Republican Rep. Ken Buck resigned from Congress. In a special election Tuesday to fill the remaining months of Buck’s term, Republican Greg Lopez, a former mayor of the city of Parker, beat a Democratic and third-party candidates. . Buck cited the divisiveness of today's politics and his party's devotion to Trump in explaining his decision to resign. That division remains a factor in the race and is also on display in another Republican House primary in Colorado Springs, about an hour's drive south of Denver. . In the 5th Congressional District, Republican Dave Williams faced condemnation from his own ranks and demands for his resignation as GOP party chair, accused of using his position and state party resources to boost his own campaign. . The final straw for some Republicans was a recent email calling people celebrating Gay Pride Month “godless groomers.” The state party's account on the social platform X also posted: “Burn all the #pride flags this June.” . Williams' opponent in the primary was Jeff Crank, a conservative commentator who has a similar political platform but breaks in style and disposition. Both are vying to fill the seat of Republican Rep. Doug Lamborn, who is not seeking reelection.. Williams is a hard-line Trump acolyte who has parroted the former president's lies about the 2020 election and attacked fellow Republicans who don't align. Crank is molded in an older, more pragmatic GOP tradition. . As in the 4th District, the winner of the Republican-friendly 5th District will be favored in the general election. . Another GOP House race watched closely on the national level was the 8th District, newly minted after redistricting in 2021 and hotly contested with voters roughly split between the two major parties.. Republican state Rep. Gabe Evans, a former police officer, defeated former state Rep. Janak Joshi, a retired physician, in the race to challenge Democratic incumbent Yadira Caraveo. Caraveo won the 8th District, which stretches north of Denver, by fewer than 2,000 votes in 2022. . The primary winner will likely benefit from a windfall of support from the National Republican Campaign Committee, which is intent on defending the party's thin House majority.. Farther to the west, among the Rocky Mountains and high desert mesas, a half-dozen Republicans were looking to replace Boebert as the nominee in the 3rd District. . The contenders include attorney Jeff Hurd and former Republican state Rep. Ron Hanks, whose differences largely follow the contours of Cranks’ and Williams’, respectively. Other candidates include Stephen Varela, a former Democrat who switched parties, businessman Lew Webb and financial advisor Russ Andrews. . The winner will be up against Adam Frisch, the businessman and Democratic candidate who lost to Boebert by only 546 votes in 2022, garnering name recognition from that close race. in the conservative district.

abcnews.com,"Judge alters Trump’s gag order, letting him talk about witnesses, jury after hush money conviction",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/judge-alters-trumps-gag-order-letting-talk-witnesses-111413008,2024-06-25 16:06:26,"A judge has modified Donald Trump’s gag order, freeing the former president to comment about witnesses and jurors in his New York hush money criminal trial but keeping court and prosecution staff off limits. NEW YORK -- A Manhattan judge on Tuesday modified Donald Trump's gag order, freeing the former president to comment publicly about witnesses and jurors in the hush money criminal trial that led to his felony conviction, but keeping others connected to the case off limits until he is sentenced July 11.. Judge Juan M. Merchan’s decision — just days before Trump’s debate Thursday with President Joe Biden — clears the presumptive Republican nominee to again go on the attack against his lawyer-turned-foe lawyer Michael Cohen, porn actor Stormy Daniels and other trial witnesses. Trump was convicted in New York on May 30 of falsifying records to cover up a potential sex scandal, making him the first ex-president convicted of a crime.. In a five-page ruling, Merchan wrote that the gag order was meant to “protect the integrity of the judicial proceedings"" and that protections for witnesses and jurors no longer applied now that the trial has ended and the jury has been discharged.. Merchan said it had been his “strong preference” to continue barring Trump from commenting about jurors, whose names have not been made public, but that he couldn't justify doing so. The judge did leave in place a separate order prohibiting Trump and his lawyers from disclosing the identities of individual jurors or their addresses. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said after the verdict the defense team has destroyed that information.. “There is ample evidence to justify continued concern for the jurors,” Merchan wrote.. Merchan also left in place a ban on Trump commenting about court staffers, the prosecution team and their families until he is sentenced, writing that they must “continue to perform their lawful duties free from threats, intimidation, harassment, and harm.” Those restrictions do not prohibit Trump from commenting about the judge himself or District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office prosecuted the case.. Trump’s lawyers had urged Merchan to lift the gag order completely, arguing there was nothing to warrant restricting Trump’s First Amendment rights after the trial’s conclusion. Trump has said the gag order prevented him from defending himself while Cohen and Daniels continued to pillory him.. Though largely a win for Trump, his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung criticized Tuesday's ruling as “another unlawful decision by a highly conflicted judge, which is blatantly un-American as it gags President Trump, the leading candidate in the 2024 Presidential Election during the upcoming Presidential Debate on Thursday.”. Cheung said Trump and his lawyers “will immediately challenge today’s unconstitutional order,"" arguing that portions of the gag order still in effect prevent him from speaking about the judge, whom he alleges had a conflict of interest, or repeating his unfounded claims that Biden directed the prosecution. . The Manhattan DA's office had asked Merchan to keep the gag order’s ban on comments about the jury and trial staff in place at least until Trump is sentenced, but said last week they would be OK allowing Trump to comment about witnesses now that the trial is over.. A message seeking comment was left with the Manhattan DA's office.. Cohen, who testified for four days against his ex-boss, reacted to the ruling via text message. He wrote: “For the past 6 years, Donald and acolytes have been making constant negative statements about me. Donald’s failed strategy of discrediting me so that he can avoid accountability didn’t work then and won’t work now.”. Daniels’ lawyer Clark Brewster said they “have nothing but respect” for Merchan and defer to his post-verdict review of the gag order “in the context of free speech and any continuing danger to the judicial process.”. “His decision to impose restrictions on Mr. Trump, as it related to reckless and unrelenting character attacks on court personnel, trial witnesses, and potentially jurors was extraordinary but clearly justified given the defendant’s uncontrollable daily rants,” Brewster said.. Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. She claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies.. The crime is punishable by up to four years behind bars, but prosecutors haven't said if they would seek incarceration and it’s unclear if Merchan would impose such a sentence. Other options include a fine or probation.. Following his conviction, Trump complained he was under a “nasty gag order,” while also testing its limits. In remarks a day after his conviction, Trump referred to Cohen as “a sleazebag,” though not by name. . In a subsequent Newsmax interview, Trump took issue with jury and its makeup, complaining about Manhattan, “It’s a very, very liberal democrat area so I knew we were in deep trouble,” and claiming: “I never saw a glimmer of a smile from the jury. No, this was a venue that was very unfair. A tiny fraction of the people are Republicans.”. Trump’s lawyers, who said they were under the impression the gag order would end with a verdict, wrote to Merchan on June 4 asking him to lift the order.. Prosecutors wanted Merchan to keep the gag order’s ban on comments about jurors and trial staff “at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.” They argued the judge had “an obligation to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice.”. Merchan issued Trump’s gag order on March 26, a few weeks before the start of the trial, after prosecutors raised concerns about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s propensity to assail people involved in his cases.. Merchan later expanded it to prohibit comments about his own family after Trump made social media posts attacking the judge’s daughter, a Democratic political consultant.. During the trial, Merchan held Trump in contempt of court, fined him $10,000 for violating the gag order and threatened to put him in jail if he did it again.. In seeking to lift the order, Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove argued that Trump was entitled to “unrestrained campaign advocacy” in light of Biden’s public comments about the verdict, and Cohen and Daniels ′ continued public criticism.. __.

SEOUL, South Korea -- Forensic and other experts combed through the charred ruins of a factory building near South Korea's capital to find the cause of a devastating fire that killed 23 people, mostly Chinese migrant workers, in one of the country's deadliest blazes in years. . More than 100 people were working at the factory in Hwaseong city, just south of Seoul, when the fire tore through it Monday morning. Security cameras showed smoke engulfing the second-floor worksite of the factory, soon after sparks were detected from a site where lithium batteries were stored, fire officials said.. One victim was pronounced dead at a hospital, and fire workers retrieved 21 bodies from the factory one by one later Monday. An additional body was recovered on Tuesday. Eighteen victims were Chinese, two were South Korean and one was Laotian. The nationalities of the other two dead were being verified.. Many Chinese people, including ethnic Koreans, have migrated to South Korea to find jobs since China and South Korea established diplomatic ties in 1992. Like other migrant laborers from Southeast Asian countries, they often work in factories, construction sites and restaurants, engaging in the so-called “difficult, dangerous and dirty” jobs that are shunned by more affluent South Koreans.. Chinese Ambassador Xing Haiming visited the factory site on Monday night and reportedly expressed condolences to the victims. Police were extracting DNA samples from the dead bodies and their potential relatives to confirm their relations, according to fire officials. . One factory worker remains out of contact, and officials say the body discovered Tuesday likely belongs to that person. Eight were injured, two of them in serious condition.. In a Cabinet Council meeting Tuesday, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country's No. 2 official, instructed officials to provide support to bereaved families over funerals and compensation issues. He also asked for safety inspections on industrial sites. During a visit to the site Monday, President Yoon Suk Yeol ordered officials to put in place measures to effectively deal with battery-related fires.. On Tuesday, more than 50 fire officers, aided by two rescue dogs and other equipment, were mobilized to continue searching the burned factory, local fire official Kim Jin-young told a briefing. .

After deeply bowing with other company officials, Park said he would offer all available assistance to bereaved families and faithfully undergo government investigations over the blaze. . Most of the dead workers were daily laborers so they were not likely familiar with the building’s internal structure, senior fire officer Jo Seon-ho told reporters Monday.

abcnews.com,The AP is setting up a sister organization seeking grants to support local and state news,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ap-setting-sister-organization-seeking-grants-support-local-111411237,2024-06-25 13:18:28,"The Associated Press says it is setting up a sister organization to solicit donor funding in support of local and state news, both at AP and elsewhere. NEW YORK -- The Associated Press says it is setting up a sister organization that will seek to raise money in support of state and local news reporting, as the crisis in that sector shows little sign of abating.. The organization, which will have a board of directors independent of the AP, will solicit philanthropic spending to boost this news coverage, both within the AP and through outside organizations, the news outlet said Tuesday.. “We feel we have to lean in at this point, not pull back,” said Daisy Veerasingham, the AP's president and CEO. “But the supporting mechanism — the local newspaper market that used to support this — can't afford to do that anymore.”. Veerasingham said she's been encouraged by preliminary talks with some funders who have expressed concern about the state of local journalism.. Like other news organizations, the AP has turned to philanthropies for help in recent years, accepting grants totaling $60.9 million over the past seven years. It has used this money to expand coverage in certain subject areas, such as climate and religion.. The local news industry has collapsed over the past two decades, with the number of journalists working in newspapers dropping from 75,000 to 31,000 in 2022, according to Northwestern University. More than half of the nation's counties have no local news outlets or only one.. While the AP has similarly cut back on staffing in the 50 states, it refused on Tuesday to detail the extent.. The organization has recently announced collaborations to share news with several nonprofit news outlets, including the Texas Tribune, CalMatters, South Dakota News Watch, the Honolulu Civil Beat and others.. “We want to add new products and services to help the industry,” Veerasingham said.. AP in particular can play an important role in bolstering coverage of government and political news in the states, said Tim Franklin, who leads the local news initiative at Northwestern’s Medill journalism school. The Pew Research Center has detailed that there are fewer full-time reporters working in statehouses than there were a decade ago.. Led by the Knight Foundation and MacArthur Foundation, an initiative launched last year pledged $500 million to build local news sources and help existing ones survive and make digital transitions. But the scope of the problem is much larger, Franklin said.. With fewer news sources, Franklin worries about the spread of misinformation and the growth of partisan local news outlets wreaking havoc on the upcoming election season.. “The bottom line is the need to find a sustainable model for independent local news in this country,” he said.. Once funded primarily by newspaper members of its cooperative, the AP has been forced to diversify in recent years, a need driven home when the Gannett and McClatchy news chains said earlier this year they will stop using AP journalism.. Besides philanthropy, the AP has been more aggressively marketing its own news website and asking for reader donations. “We believe there is a gap in the U.S. market, in the consumer arena, for people who want independent, fact-based, non-partisan news, and that's the role that the AP plays in the ecosystem,” Veerasingham said.. The AP offers a range of services to the industry and outside — serving as the exclusive commercial photo partner of the NFL, for example. It was among the first news organizations to make a deal with an artificial intelligence company to license its archive of news stories.. “Any media organization is going to have to have a mixed portfolio in the way that it supports itself,” Veerasingham said. . ___.

abcnews.com,"Charitable donations continue to decline, down 2.1% in 2023, according to a new Giving USA report",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/charitable-donations-continue-decline-21-2023-new-giving-111402392,2024-06-25 09:58:24,"Charitable giving dropped 2.1% in 2023 after inflation, according to the most recent Giving USA report, the key findings of which were released Tuesday. Charitable giving dropped 2.1% in 2023 after inflation, according to the most recent Giving USA report, the key findings of which were released Tuesday.. For years now, nonprofits have been worried about the decline in the number of Americans who give. This year’s Giving USA report won’t allay their concerns: Giving by individuals in 2023 dropped 2.4%. The share of overall giving that came from individual donors continued to decline, albeit slightly, from 67.4% in 2022 to 67.2% in 2023. As recently as 2013, individual donors accounted for 73% of overall giving.. In 2023, foundations accounted for 19% of overall giving ($103.5 billion), bequests accounted for 8% ($42.7 billion), and the remaining 7% came from corporations.. While 2023’s drop in giving is discouraging, there are signs that charitable giving may finally be settling into a new normal after several years of being buffeted by unusual events like the pandemic and record inflation.. “The organizations that we’re working with saw a slight decrease” in 2023, says Rick Dunham, founder of Dunham+Company, a fundraising consulting firm. “A lot of it has to do with the economy. Donors pulled back in the past year, primarily because of inflation and personal economic situations.”. The economy was a big factor in giving last year, says Una Osili, associate dean for Research and International Programs at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, which helps produce Giving USA.. “Giving rises as the economy improves,” Osili says. “The economy outperformed expectations. The stock market was also performing at double-digit rates, even adjusted for inflation. However, inflation continued to be a challenge.”. Nonprofits like Feeding San Diego, which provides meals to the hungry, felt the crush of inflation in multiple ways last year. Donors talked about being uncertain how much they could give at the same time the price of food went up and the number of people using its services swelled.. “When you look at the economy holistically, it might look like things are rosy, but the bottom line is that food is far more expensive than it was four years ago, and wages have not kept up,” says Ali Colbran, the group’s senior director of development. “So there are more families that need help from places like Feeding San Diego today than even during 2020 and 2021.”. Inflation was 8% in 2022, which contributed to a precipitous drop in giving that year. (Giving USA's updated estimates put that decrease at 8.4%.) In 2023, inflation was just 4.1%, but it was still enough to wipe out any gains in giving. Using current dollars, giving grew from $547 billion in 2022 to $557 billion, a gain of 1.9% that turns into a 2.1% loss after taking inflation into account.. Similarly, all causes but one — giving to individuals — saw giving gains in current dollars. But giving to religion dropped 1%, to international affairs 1.6%, and to individuals 20.5% when adjusted for inflation.. The international relief organization Project Hope says each year in recent memory, including 2023, it has raised money for a humanitarian crisis — including conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East as well as massive natural disasters such as earthquakes — and it’s been hard to get donors’ attention as more and more bad things happen in the world.. “It really kind of feels like the world is on fire right now,” says Cinira Baldi, chief development and communications officer for the group. “There’s a little bit of people feeling like, ‘There’s so much going on, I don’t know if I can make a difference.’”. While three causes saw mild decreases, the rest had gains. Human services rose 1.7%, environment and animals 3.9%, and health 4.4%. More significant were gains for arts, culture, and humanities, 6.6%; education, 6.7%; public-society benefit, 7.2%; and gifts to foundations, 10.8%.. The report notes that contributions to causes that saw the biggest jumps — public-society benefit organizations and foundations — dropped 15% and 21%, respectively, from 2021 to 2022.. Some of the causes with the biggest gains are those that have significant support from high net worth donors, Osili adds.. “Many wealthy households had high rates of savings, and their balance sheets were quite strong going into 2023,” she says. “If you put all that together, the sectors that high net worth households tend to give to — education, the arts, public-society benefit — those performed relatively well.”. Last year’s Giving USA report highlighted the role of exceptionally large donations — gifts of $550 million or more — which totaled nearly $14 billion in 2022, or 5% of individual giving. In 2023, the influence of outsize gifts lessened, with about $8 billion in megagifts accounting for about 2% of individual giving.. “We are down in megagiving from where we were,” says Jon Bergdoll, associate director of data partnerships at the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, who notes that the giving is still very high. “Last year’s amount would have been a record for any year prior to 2020.”. The nonprofit world’s reliance on wealthy donors is a problem, says Woodrow Rosenbaum, chief data officer for GivingTuesday. He says everyday donors will likely continue to fall away unless nonprofits work hard to bring them back into the fold.. “We’ve been saying for quite some time it is vital for the nonprofit sector to engage more broadly if we’re going to reverse that trend and be resilient into the future,” Rosenbaum says. “So what happens next for nonprofits depends a lot on how nonprofits show up.”. Many organizations say giving has gotten off to a strong start in 2024, and fundraisers are cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year.. The Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, hopes to keep its fundraising momentum going. Last year, the theater beat its goal of $1.98 million by reaching out to donors and having more conversations to understand what they love about the theater and what they want from it, says Jackie Blevins-Johnson, director of individual philanthropy the theater. The organization raised $2.3 million, roughly a million dollars more than the typical annual fundraising goal of $1.3 million.. Blevins-Johnson had dinner with small groups of supporters as often as three times a week. “It’s about the conversation and the relationship,” Blevins-Johnson says. “We share our Barter Theatre stories. I like to call it friendraising.”. ______. Rasheeda Childress is senior editor for fundraising at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, where you can read the full article.

Iowa public utility regulators on Tuesday approved a controversial carbon dioxide pipeline for transporting emissions of the climate-warming greenhouse gas for storage underground in a win for Summit Carbon Solutions' project after setbacks in other states and opposition from landowners around the Midwest.. The company still has many hoops to jump through before it can begin building in Iowa, including gaining other states' approval.. The $5.5 billion, 2,500-mile (4,023.36 kilometers) pipeline network would carry planet-warming CO2 emissions, liquefied under pressure, from more than 50 ethanol plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota to be stored deep underground in central North Dakota.. Farmers and the ethanol industry see the pipeline as a way to qualify for federal tax breaks they see as key for growing a market for a cleaner-burning aviation fuel. Corn is among the top two crops in the Midwest, and Iowa is the leader in corn and ethanol production.. “Whether you think it’s smart or silly, the world’s largest airlines want to decarbonize their fuel. Carbon capture and sequestration gets Iowa ethanol into that market, potentially providing a generational boost to Iowa’s economy,"" Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said in a statement.. Summit CEO Lee Blank welcomed the decision in a statement.. The project's opponents, including many landowners, fear their land will be taken for the pipeline and that a potential pipeline rupture could release dangerous CO2 gas. A coalition opposing Summit's project vowed to fight the Iowa board's decision. . Landowner attorney Brian Jorde said the decision was expected, with a lengthy process for Summit still ahead, such as applying in South Dakota.. “It's just one small thing in a maze, in a track-and-field event full of hurdles that they have to get over,” Jorde said.. The Iowa Utilities Board approved Summit’s January 2022 application for a permit to build and operate the pipeline. But before the board issues the permit, the company must file proof of an insurance policy of at least $100 million to pay for any damages resulting from the pipeline project. Summit must provide proof of the insurance annually. . The company also can't start construction until it has approvals from North Dakota and South Dakota, including for routes in both states and underground storage in North Dakota. Summit also needs approvals from Minnesota and in Nebraska before it can begin to build lines out to ethanol plants in those states.. The Iowa regulators' decision comes after hearings last year and setbacks in other states. North Dakota regulators denied a siting permit in August, but later agreed to reconsider. Hearings on the underground storage proposal were held earlier this month.. South Dakota regulators denied Summit's application in September; Summit said it plans to file again in early July. In Nebraska, where Summit must work with individual counties, at least one county has denied a permit.. The Iowa panel also granted the company the right of eminent domain over numerous parcels of land, but only after the permit is issued. The extent of Summit's eminent domain powers wasn't immediately clear from the 500-page order. The board denied use of some parcels of land; others require modifications to the route. Eminent domain is the taking of private land for public use with compensation for landowners.. The order also includes numerous other requirements of Summit, such as monthly construction reports and grants for equipment for cities and counties to respond to incidents.. Supporters view carbon capture projects such as Summit's as a combatant of climate change, with new federal tax incentives and billions from Congress for such carbon capture efforts. Opponents question the technology's effectiveness at scale and the need for potentially huge investments over cheaper renewable energy sources.. Companies behind two other CO2 pipeline projects proposed in the Midwest have canceled or shelved their plans. From the renewable fuels industry perspective, blows to projects such as Summit's could put at risk the huge potential of a new aviation fuel market the industry believes would continue for many years.. North Dakota Republican Gov. Doug Burgum supports the pipeline. He has hailed North Dakota's underground rock formations as a “geologic jackpot” for CO2 storage potential. In 2021, he set a goal for North Dakota to become carbon neutral by 2030. He isn't seeking reelection this year, and is a top choice to be former President Donald Trump's running mate.. ___.

SEOUL, South Korea -- Rescue workers were combing through the charred ruins of a factory building near South Korea's capital to find any more fire victims Tuesday, a day after a devastating blaze likely triggered by exploding lithium batteries killed 22 people, mostly Chinese migrant workers.. More than 100 people were working at the factory in Hwaseong city, just south of Seoul, when the fire tore through it Monday morning. Security cameras showed smoke engulfing the second-floor worksite of the factory, soon after sparks were detected from a site where lithium batteries were stored, fire officials said.. One victim was pronounced dead at a hospital, and fire workers retrieved 21 bodies from the factory one by one later Monday. Eighteen victims were Chinese, two were South Korean and one was Laotian. The nationality of one of the dead was being verified.. Many Chinese people, including ethnic Koreans, have migrated to South Korea to find jobs since China and South Korea established diplomatic ties in 1992. Like other migrant laborers from Southeast Asian countries, they often work in factories, construction sites and restaurants, engaging in the so-called “difficult, dangerous and dirty” jobs that are shunned by more affluent South Koreans.. Chinese Ambassador Xing Haiming visited the factory site on Monday night and reportedly expressed condolences to the victims. Police were extracting DNA samples from the dead bodies and their potential relatives to confirm their relations, according to fire officials. . One factory worker remains out of contact but his mobile phone signal was detected at the building on Monday afternoon. Eight were injured, two of them in serious condition.. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol also visited the factory site Monday. He expressed condolences to the dead people and ordered officials to put in place measures to effectively deal with battery-related fires, according to Yoon’s office.. On Tuesday, more than 50 fire officers, aided by two rescue dogs and other equipment, were mobilized to continue searching the burned factory, local fire official Kim Jin-young told a televised briefing.

LONDON -- Microsoft violated European Union antitrust rules with “possibly abusive” practices by tying its Teams messaging and videoconferencing app to its widely used business software, the bloc said.. The European Commission said Monday it informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that the U.S. tech giant has been “restricting competition” by bundling Teams with core office productivity applications such as Office 365 and Microsoft 365. . The commission, the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said it suspects Microsoft might have granted Teams a “distribution advantage” by not giving customers a choice on whether to have Teams when they purchased the software. The advantage might have been widened by limits on the ability of rival messaging apps to work with Microsoft software, it said. . “We are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,” Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president for competition policy, said in a statement. . “And preserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets.” . The commission took aim at Microsoft a day after accusing Apple of breaching the bloc's new digital competition rulebook, in a flurry of regulatory action underlining Brussels' leading role as a watchdog for Big Tech companies. . Microsoft made some changes last year in an effort to head off an penalty, including offering the software packages without Teams for European customers. But the commission said Tuesday the changes are not enough to address its concerns and that it needs to do more to ""restore competition."". “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission‘s remaining concerns.” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a prepared statement. . In April, the company also gave customers worldwide the option to get Microsoft 365 and Office 365 without Teams. The two software suites include programs like Word, Excel and Outlook. . Microsoft now has a chance to respond to the accusations, formally known as a statement of objections, before the commission makes its final decision. The company could face a fine worth up to 10% of its annual global revenue, or be forced to carry out “remedies"" to satisfy the competition concerns. . The commission opened its investigation in July 2023 after rival Slack Technologies, which makes popular workplace messaging software, filed a complaint with Brussels. Alfaview, which makes videoconferencing software, also filed a separate complaint. . Slack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, had alleged that Microsoft abused its market dominance to eliminate competition — in violation of EU laws.. “The Statement of Objections issued today by the European Commission is a win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft’s practices with Teams have harmed competition,” Salesforce President Sabastian Niles said. “We appreciate the Commission’s thorough investigation of Slack’s complaint and urge the Commission to move towards a swift, binding, and effective remedy that restores free and fair choice and promotes competition, interoperability, and innovation in the digital ecosystem.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- The Norwegian government on Tuesday signed a deal to start stockpiling grain, saying the COVID-19 pandemic, a war in Europe and climate change have made it necessary.. The deal to store 30,000 tons of grain in 2024 and 2025 was signed by agriculture and food minister Geir Pollestad, finance minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum and four private companies. The wheat, which will belong to the Norwegian government, will be stored in already existing facilities by the companies in facilities across the country. Three of the companies will store at least 15,000 tons this year. . Companies “are free to invest in new facilities and decide for themselves where they want to store the emergency grain, but they must make the grain available to the state if needed,” the government said.. Norway’s ministry for agriculture and food said, “the building up of a contingency stock of food grains is about being prepared for the unthinkable."". “There should be an extra level of security in the event of major disruptions in the international trade systems or failure of national production,” Slagsvold Vedum said. “This is an important part of the government’s work to strengthen national preparedness.”. Norway will sign further stockpiling contracts in the coming years, with the goal of building up the reserve until 2029. The aim is to have some 82,500 tons of grain in storage by the end of the decade ""so that we then have enough grain for three months’ consumption by Norway’s population in a crisis situation that may arise,” Pollestad told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.. Norway has 5.6 million people.. Last year, the Scandinavian nation said it would spend 63 million kroner ($6 million) per year on stocking up on grain.. Norway had stored grain in the 1950s but closed down its storage sites in 2003 after deciding they were no longer needed. . However, following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Norway set up a commission to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of its emergency preparedness systems which recommended stockpiling grain products. . The oil-rich country, which has supported Ukraine, also houses the Global Seed Vault in its Svalbard archipelago, some 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the North Pole.. Since 2008, gene banks and organizations around the world have deposited nearly 1 million samples of seeds at the vault to back up their own collections in case of human-caused or natural calamities.. The Norwegian government funded the construction cost, while an international nonprofit organization pays for operational costs.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "
abcnews.com,GM brings in new CEO to steer troubled Cruise robotaxi service while Waymo ramps up in San Francisco,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/gm-brings-new-ceo-steer-troubled-cruise-robotaxi-111420594,2024-06-25 17:02:25,"General Motors has named a veteran technology executive with roots in the video game industry to steer its troubled robotaxi service Cruise. General Motors on Tuesday named a veteran technology executive with roots in the video game industry to steer its troubled robotaxi service Cruise as it tries to recover from a gruesome collision that triggered the suspension of its California license.. Marc Whitten, one of the key engineers behind the Xbox video game console, will take over as Cruise's chief executive nearly nine months after one of the service's robotaxis dragged a jaywalking pedestrian — who had just been struck by a vehicle driven by a human — across a darkened street in San Francisco before coming to a stop.. That early October 2023 incident prompted California regulators to slam the brakes on Cruise's robotaxis in San Francisco. It had previously giving the driverless vehicles approval to charge for rides throughout the second densest city in the U.S., despite objections of local government officials who cited flaws in the autonomous technology.. General Motors, which had hoped Cruise would be generating $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, has since scaled back its massive investments in the robotaxi service. The cutbacks resulted in 900 workers being laid off j ust weeks after Cruise co-founder and former CEO Kyle Vogt resigned from his job in the aftermath of crash that sent the pedestrian to the hospital.. The arrival of new leadership at Cruise came on the same day rival robotaxi service Waymo disclosed its driverless vehicles are ready to start picking up anyone in San Francisco who wants ride within the city. Waymo had been only accepting requests from riders selected from a waiting list that had grown to 300,000 people.. It’s the second major city where Waymo’s robotaxis are open to all comers, joining Phoenix, where the driverless vehicles have been giving rides for several years. . Although Waymo’s vehicles so far haven’t been involved in any collisions like the one that sidelined Cruise, the company recently issued a voluntary recall that required delivering a software update throughout its fleet after one of its robotaxis hit a telephone pole in Phoenix.. Whitten, who also has worked at Amazon and Sonos, will be taking over a robotaxi service facing far more daunting challenges. General Motors earlier this year disclosed that the U.S. Justice Department has opened an inquiry into Cruise’s handling of the October crash in San Francisco. California regulators also fined Cruise $112,000 for its response to that collision. . In a statement, Whitten said he believes Cruise can still make transportation safer than it has been with humans behind the wheel of cars. . “It is an opportunity of a lifetime to be part of this transformation,” Whitten said. ”The team at Cruise has built world-class technology, and I look forward to working with them to help bring this critical mission to life.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,Spain eliminates sales tax on olive oil to help consumers cope with skyrocketing prices,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/spain-eliminates-sales-tax-olive-oil-consumers-cope-111401144,2024-06-25 09:42:31,"Spain's government says it will temporarily eliminate the sales tax on olive oil to help cushion skyrocketing prices. MADRID -- Spain will temporarily eliminate the sales tax on olive oil to help consumers cope with skyrocketing prices, the government said Tuesday.. Spain is the world’s leading producer and exporter of olive oil, but its cost for domestic consumers has risen dramatically due to global inflationary pressures and a prolonged drought that decimated supplies. Prices have also surged in other Mediterranean countries.. The price of olive oil has increased by 272% since September 2020, according to Spain’s agriculture ministry. A five-liter bottle of olive oil can cost over 50 euros ($53) at a Spanish supermarket.. Spaniards use olive oil to cook and to garnish sandwiches, salads, vegetables and other dishes. Last year Spanish households consumed on average 6 liters per person, compared to 0.4 liters for international consumers, according to the agriculture ministry. But the rise in prices has made some switch to cheaper cooking oils.. The government had already slashed the sales tax on olive oil from 10% to 5% as part of an anti-inflation package.. No sales tax will be applied to olive oil from July through September, when it will be taxed at 2% until the end of the year. From then on, it will be taxed at 4% and be considered a basic food stuff.. Spanish Treasury Minister María Jesús Montero said the decision reflects “the importance of olive oil in the Mediterranean diet and a healthy lifestyle.”. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

abcnews.com,The Lahaina fire worsened Maui's housing shortage. Now officials eye limiting tourist Airbnb rentals,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/maui-ponders-future-leaders-restricting-vacation-rentals-loved-111392704,2024-06-25 13:02:35,"The mayor of Maui County in Hawaii wants to stop owners of thousands of vacation properties from renting to visitors. HONOLULU -- Alicia Humiston bought her condo in Lahaina after she visited Maui and fell for its rainforests, lava fields and the whales that gather offshore. She travels there about three times a year and rents out her unit for short periods when she's not in Hawaii.. “Maui was my dream place,” she said in a phone interview from her home in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.. But now Maui's mayor wants to make it impossible for Humiston and thousands of other condo owners to rent their properties to tourists. Instead, he wants them rented long-term to Maui locals to address a chronic housing shortage that reached a new crisis point after last August's deadly wildfire burned the homes of 12,000 residents.. The mayor's proposal faces multiple legislative and bureaucratic hurdles, starting Tuesday with a Maui Planning Commission meeting. Yet it has inflamed an already-heated debate about the future of one of the world's best-known travel destinations: Will Maui continue to cater to tourists, who power the local economy? Or will it curb tourism to address persistent complaints that visitors are overwhelming the island's beaches and roads and making housing unaffordable?. About one-third of Maui's visitors use vacation rentals. They tend to cost less than hotels and are easy to reserve on websites like Airbnb and VRBO. Many have kitchens, so families can prepare their own food.. They have also become a source of strife, particularly after last year's conflagration in Lahaina — the deadliest wildfire in the U.S. in more than a century. The fire tore through the historic town, killing at least 101 people and leaving nothing but rubble and ash for blocks. Thousands of displaced locals were temporarily housed in hotels usually reserved for tourists, and most survivors still lack stable housing.. Even before the fire, University of Hawaii researchers say so many property owners were renting to tourists — and so few new dwellings were being built — that Maui County suffered a net loss of housing since 2019.. An analysis of property tax records shows 85% of Maui County's condos are owned by out-of-state residents, said Justin Tyndall, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization. Transitioning them would boost Maui’s residential housing stock by 13%, which Tyndall said would almost certainly lead to lower buying prices and rents.. Maui Mayor Richard Bissen believes that under his proposal, those lower rents would keep locals on Maui because absentee landlords would be forced to either sell their units or convert them to long-term rentals.. There are 7,000 condo units in apartment zones, including 2,200 in West Maui near the Lahaina burn zone, and they account for about half of Maui’s legally operated short-term rentals. If enacted, the change would take effect in West Maui no later than July 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2026 elsewhere.. “We understand that there’s going to be a give and take. So the question is, what is most important?” Bissen said at a news conference last month. “My priority is housing our local residents - especially now.”. Humiston, president of the Hawaii Rental By Owner Awareness Association, which opposes the bill, won't sell her one-bedroom, oceanfront condo that she bought two decades ago if the bill became law. She also doesn’t plan to rent it long-term.. “It would take my ability to use my property. And I bought it for my use,” she said. “I love it there.”. Some warn that reducing the supply of lodging for visitors will ruin the tourism industry Maui's economy depends on, though backers of the mayor's bill say many vacation rentals will remain and hotels will have empty rooms visitors can stay in.. Hawaii economist Paul Brewbaker calculates that changing the rules for the affected units, which account for one-third of Maui’s visitor accommodations, would result in 33% fewer tourists and cost Maui 14,000 jobs. He called it a “slow-motion train-wreck” that would lead to an “economic crash and burn.”. Maui County Chair Alice Lee said that while housing for residents is a real concern, the council must also consider legal challenges from property owners and the potential hit on tax revenue.. The county collects $500 million in real property taxes annually and more than 40% comes from short-term rentals, which are taxed at a higher rate than owner-occupied residences, she said.. “We are being sued by over 600 people regarding the fire. We have that many lawsuits pending. Do we really want to put ourselves in a position to invite thousands more?” Lee said. “I really don’t think so, because my main concern right now, at this very moment, is to pay the bills and keep the lights on.”. The county has budgeted $300,000 to study the bill's impact on tax revenue and businesses like landscaping and cleaning services.. Jeremy Stice, a real estate agent who was born and raised on Maui, and his wife have spent 12 years building a company that today manages more than 40 vacation rental properties, mostly for other owners. About half of them would be affected by the measure, said Stice, who is also president of the Maui Vacation Rental Association.. Stice isn't sure local residents would buy — or could afford — short-term rental units even if they do become available for permanent housing.. For example, a studio in Papakea, one of the targeted condo complexes, would sell for about $600,000, he said. A 30-year-fixed mortgage at current interest rates, plus the homeowner association fees, would total about $5,000 a month for a small space, he said.. If locals don't buy them, and tourists don't rent them, it's possible the units would sit mostly empty as second homes for wealthy absentee owners — an even worse outcome.. To prevent that, the county should raise taxes on second homes, create incentives to promote long-term rentals and prioritize new housing construction, said Matt Jachowski, a Maui housing data consultant.. “The only way out of this housing crisis is to do everything — to do everything in our power to add more resident housing,” he said.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Tuesday launched membership talks with Ukraine, a decade after Russian troops seized the Crimean Peninsula to deter the country from moving closer to the West, part of a chain of events that set the two neighbors on the path to war.. Ukraine’s accession negotiations were set in motion at an intergovernmental conference in Luxembourg. Just a few hours later, Moldova also launched its membership talks. While the events are a major milestone on their European paths, the talks could take years to conclude.. In opening remarks presented via video-link, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal described it as “a historic day” that marks “a new chapter” in his country’s ties with the bloc, particularly as the war with Russia rages on.. “We fully understand that there is still much work ahead of us on the path to accession. We are ready for it. We have demonstrated that we can move swiftly and achieve the impossible,” Shmyhal said.. Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib, whose country currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency, described it as “a historic moment for us all, and marks a milestone in our relationship.”. Lahbib said the EU condemns “Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine and salutes the resilience of the Ukrainian people,” and added that the bloc will continue to support Ukraine in the war “for as long as it takes and as intensely as needed.”. Ukraine's delegation was led in Luxembourg by deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration Olga Stefanishyna. “This is a truly historical moment for my country. All the nation stands as one behind this decision,” she told reporters as she arrived for the ceremony.. Stefanishyna said the hope embodied in the opening of the talks will give Ukraine's citizens “the moral power to continue withstanding” the Russian invasion.. The intergovernmental conferences officially started the process of aligning the countries' laws and standards with those of the 27-nation bloc, which is notably concerned about corruption in both. However, the actual negotiations are unlikely to begin for a few months.. Ukraine and Moldova applied to join the EU in the days and weeks after Russia invaded in February 2022. By June 2022, EU leaders had quickly made it all official. But things have moved more slowly since then for Kyiv and membership, if it comes, might be years away.. Turkey’s accession talks have lasted almost two decades without result.. Still, starting the talks process is sending another strong signal of solidarity with Ukraine beyond the financial support the EU has provided, which officials estimate at around 100 billion euros ($107 billion). It’s also a show of support for Moldova, which has faced its own challenges with Russia.. “It is a historic event for us in historical times for Europe and it signifies the strong commitment of both sides to European peace, security, stability and prosperity,"" said Prime Minister Dorin Recean. “We will spare no effort to achieve our strategic goal of becoming an EU member.”. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, neighboring Moldova has faced several crises that have at times raised fears the country might also be in Russia’s crosshairs, from errant missiles landing on its territory, to an energy crisis sparked after Moscow cut gas supplies.. “We are very much affected by the brutal war of Russia in Ukraine, and we are helping each other in the security matters but also in the European accession and we will continue to do so,” Recean told reporters.. Candidate countries must bring their laws and standards into line with those of the EU in 35 policy areas, known as chapters, ranging from the free movement of goods through fisheries, taxation, energy and the environment to judicial rights and security.. Unanimous agreement must be given by all 27 member countries to open or close chapters, providing ample opportunity for EU nations to demand more work or to delay proceedings.. Hungary, which takes over the EU’s rotating presidency from Belgium in July, has routinely put the brakes on EU and NATO support for Ukraine.. “We are still at the beginning of the screening process. It’s very difficult to say at what stage Ukraine is in. From what I see here, as we speak, they are very far from meeting the accession criteria,” Hungarian Minister for European Affairs Janos Boka said as he arrived at the venue.. Bordering EU members Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, Ukraine would overtake France to become the largest member of the bloc if it joined, shifting its center of gravity further eastward. As a top grain producer its entry would have a huge impact on EU agriculture policy.. Together with Moldova, Ukraine stands in a long line of EU hopefuls — Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey — with years-long membership aspirations and which have felt left behind by Kyiv’s rapid progress.. Ukraine wants to join by 2030, but it must carry out dozens of institutional and legal reforms first. That daunting list is led by steps to combat corruption and includes broad reforms to public administration and judiciary.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Treasury Department said Tuesday it is imposing economic sanctions on 50 people and firms across Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and the Marshall Islands that have been acting as a “sprawling shadow banking network” for Iran's military.. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said the entities and individuals are involved in the sale of Iranian oil and petrochemicals, which have helped Iran's military and government gain illicit access to the international financial system. . The income pays for weapons and funding to proxy groups, including Yemen’s Houthis, as well as drone transfers to Russia, Treasury said. . Iran is accused of supplying Russia with drones that are used to bomb Ukrainian civilians as the Kremlin continues its invasion of Ukraine.. Included in the sanctions are Seyyed Mohammad Mosanna’i Najibi, an Iranian-Turkish money-changer, 27 cover companies controlled by Najibi based in Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and the Marshall Islands, and a Tehran-based currency exchange business, among others. . An inquiry through the Iranian branch of Najibi's company, known as Sadaf Exchange, was not immediately answered. . Among other things, the sanctions deny the people and firms access to any property or financial assets held in the U.S. and prevent U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with them.. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the U.S. ""will continue to pursue those who seek to finance Iran’s destabilizing terrorist activities. We continue to work with allies and partners, as well as the global financial industry, to increase vigilance against the movement of funds supporting terrorism.”. The U.S. has already sanctioned Iranian shadow banking businesses. I n March 2023, the U.S. imposed economic sanctions on 39 firms linked to a shadow banking system that helped to obfuscate financial activity between sanctioned Iranian firms and their foreign buyers, namely for petrochemicals produced in Iran.. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events.

One method of making electricity cleanly to address climate change has been quietly advancing and on Tuesday it hit a milestone. . A California utility is backing the largest new geothermal power development in the U.S. — 400 megawatts of clean electricity from the Earth’s heat — enough for some 400,000 homes. . Southern California Edison will purchase the electricity from Fervo Energy, a Houston-based geothermal company, Fervo announced.. The company is drilling up to 125 wells in southwest Utah.. Clean electricity like this reduces the need for traditional power plants that cause climate change. The boost could go a long way toward bringing down the cost of a new generation of geothermal energy, said Wilson Ricks, an energy systems researcher at Princeton University.. “If these purchases help to get this technology off the ground, it could be massively impactful for global decarbonization,” he said. Decarbonization refers to switching out things that produce carbon dioxide and methane, which cause the climate to change, in favor of machines and methods that don't. . Today the world still relies mainly on fossil fuels for round-the-clock power. This new deal shows that clean power can meet a growing demand for electricity, said Sarah Jewett, vice president of strategy at Fervo. . “I think that’s why it’s so exciting. This isn’t a niche energy resource going to a niche use,” she said. “And that is something we have not had, you know, readily available"" and able to be scaled up. . The first generation of geothermal plants, for example, The Geysers in California, tapped into superheated reservoirs of steam or very hot water close to the Earth's surface. Such reservoirs are relatively rare. . New geothermal companies are adapting drilling technology and practices taken from the oil and gas industry to create reservoirs from hot rock. That unlocks the potential for geothermal energy in many more places. Engineers have been working to advance the methods for years.. The United States is one of the world leaders in using the Earth’s heat to make electricity, but geothermal still accounts for less than half a percent of the nation’s total large-scale electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. . Fervo is pioneering horizontal drilling in geothermal reservoirs. It signed the world’s first corporate agreement with Google in 2021 to develop new geothermal power and drilled three wells in Nevada. That project began sending carbon-free electricity onto the Nevada grid in November to power data centers there.. The Cape Station project, about 200 miles south of Salt Lake City, is expected to start delivering electricity to California as early as 2026. . California Energy Commission Chair David Hochschild said the state is committed to clean, zero-carbon electricity. He said geothermal complements wind and solar farms by providing steady power when it’s not windy or sunny, and that is key to ensuring reliability as the state cuts fossil fuels.. ___.

American consumers lost some confidence in June as expectations over the near-term future fell again.. The Conference Board, a business research group, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell in June to 100.4 from 101.3 in May. The index's decline was not quite as bad as analysts were expecting.. The index measures both Americans’ assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months.. The measure of Americans’ short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell to 73 from 74.9 in May. A reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future.. Consumers’ view of current conditions rose in June to 141.5, up from 140.8 in May.. “Confidence pulled back in June but remained within the same narrow range that’s held throughout the past two years, as strength in current labor market views continued to outweigh concerns about the future,” said Dana Peterson, the Conference Board’s chief economist. . Even though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4% in May, America’s employers added a strong 272,000 jobs last month, a sign that companies are still confident enough in the economy to keep hiring despite persistently high interest rates.. Last month’s sizable job gain was propelled by consumer spending on travel, entertainment and other services. U.S. airports reported near-record traffic over the Memorial Day weekend.. Despite the better-than-expected job gains in May, there is some visible weakening in the labor market: job postings for April hit their lowest level since 2021 and the number of Americans who are receiving unemployment benefits has risen for seven straight weeks.. On Monday, Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, said that the labor market remained healthy but that future slowing could trigger higher unemployment, something that needs to be monitored closely.. Most economic indicators show the U.S. economy in good shape by historical standards, though there have been some signs that growth is slowing..

abcnews.com,Parliament speaker. The Tehran mayor. A heart surgeon. The race is on for Iran's next president,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/parliament-speaker-tehran-mayor-heart-surgeon-race-irans-111393256,2024-06-25 17:34:30,"Six candidates have been approved by Iran’s theocracy to run in Friday’s presidential election to replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash with several other officials in May. Six candidates have been approved by Iran's theocracy to run in Friday’s presidential election to replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash with several other officials in May.. Among them, Iran’s parliament speaker stands out as the most recognizable figure. A little-known politician and heart surgeon is also on the ballot. He is the only reformist while the others are more skewed toward hard-liners who back Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei without question and challenge the West. . And if previous elections are a guide to Iranian politics, several candidates could drop out in the final days before the vote to coalesce around a unity candidate. . On Tuesday, Khamenei called for “maximum” voter turnout in the election, which analysts say could support the reformist candidate. A parliamentary election in Iran earlier this year saw the lowest turnout since the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution. . Here's a look at the candidates:. Ghazizadeh Hashemi, 53, served as one of Raisi’s vice presidents and as the head of the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs. He ran in the 2021 presidential election and received just under 1 million votes, coming in last place. In debates so far, he's urged the country to continue to follow the policies of Raisi and insisted that Iran does not need foreign investment to succeed, despite the widespread economic challenges the nation now faces. . The 58-year-old Jaili is a hard-line politician and former senior nuclear negotiator. He ran in Iran's 2013 presidential election and registered in 2021 before withdrawing to support Raisi. Current CIA director Bill Burns, who dealt with Jalili in negotiations in the past, has described him as “stupefyingly opaque” in talks. He got the nickname “The Living Martyr” after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war. He maintains that Iran doesn't need to negotiate over its nuclear program with the West. Though he is seen as maintaining close ties to Khamenei, he's not considered to be a front-runner. His campaign largely has focused on rural voters.. A 69-year-old heart surgeon, Pezeshkian is the only reformist candidate among the hard-line figures seeking the presidency. He's said he'd want to renegotiate with the West to try and restart some version of the 2015 nuclear deal. He's put the need for the deal in economic terms, saying Iran needs to communicate with the world. Iran's former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who served under the relative-moderate President Hassan Rouhani and helped strike the nuclear deal, has backed him. However, analysts believe Pezeshkian would need a heavy turnout to win — which is unlikely, given the current apathy gripping the nation. His campaign has so far focused on the youth vote, women and Iran's ethnic minorities.. Pourmohammadi, 64, is the only Shiite cleric running in the election. He served as interior minister under hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and later as justice minister under Rouhani. In 2006, the United States State Department referred to Pourmohammadi as a “notorious human rights violator” for a leading role in the 1988 mass execution of several thousand political prisoners at Tehran's notorious Evin prison. The State Department also linked him to the so-called “chain murders” of activists and others in the 1990s. He's insisted the next president must deal with the world and criticized Iran's arming of Russia in the war in Ukraine — not because of the killing of civilians, but because he felt Tehran wasn't getting enough back from Moscow for its support. His campaign likely is counting on the backing of clerics and traditionalists.. The Iranian parliament speaker, Qalibaf, 62, is the highest-ranking official within the theocracy to be seeking the presidency. Analysts suggest he's the front-runner in the campaign, with Jalili as a second. Qalibaf is a former Tehran mayor with close ties to the country’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Many remember that Qalibaf — as a former Guard general — was part of a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against students in 2003 while serving as the country’s police chief. Qalibaf maintains that he, as a strong manager, can save Iran from the crisis, borrowing from recent comments made by Khamenei. Qalibaf has focused on the middle class, as well as promising more cash handouts for the poor.. The current mayor of Tehran, Zakani, 58, withdrew from the 2021 presidential election to back Raisi. Zakani has said he believes Iran can neutralize the effects of international sanctions but should pursue a diplomatic solution. He is a hard-liner who has repeatedly criticized reformists and moderates within Iran's political system, wants to see Iran stop using the dollar as a benchmark currency, and has called for Iran to create more value-added products from its oil to boost revenue. He has promised free health care for women and old people, as well as cash payments to poor people and reviving Iran's currency, the rial. However, he's offered no details on how he plans to accomplish these goals. . 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events. "

After finding the U.S. market a tough nut to crack, Vinfast is hoping its tiniest and cheapest car yet — a roughly 10-foot-long pure battery electric mini-SUV priced at $9,200 and called the VF3 — will become Vietnam’s “national car” and win over consumers in Asian markets.. Designed specifically for the Vietnamese and other Asian markets, the VF3 is priced for “mass appeal”, according to VinFast. It expects bigger sales for it than from earlier models that were meant mainly for export to western countries, Le Thi Thuy, Vingroup's chairperson, said in an earnings call in April. . VinFast was dreaming of breaking into the big leagues of global automakers when it launched sales in the U.S. last year and listed its shares on the Nasdaq, where its market value briefly surpassed those of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. in late August.. Investor enthusiasm has since cooled, and its shares are trading below $4 from a peak of $82.35. VinFast is facing delays in construction of a $4 billion factory in North Carolina, where the company said in an email that it is reviewing and evaluating “all aspects of the construction process.” It's facing legal troubles over a crash that killed four people in California. It's also dealing with allegations of patent infringement.. VinFast’s future matters for Vietnam, both because its ambitions dovetail with the Communist Party’s own goals, and because of parent company Vingroup's large role in the Vietnamese economy. The conglomerate began as an instant noodle company in Ukraine in 1990s and now runs all sorts of businesses.. VinFast reported a net loss of $2.39 billion last year, despite a 90% increase in revenue. To patch its tattered finances, Vingroup recently sold its profitable commercial property arm, Vincom Retail. Vingroup's founder, Pham Nhat Vuong, has committed $1 billion of his personal wealth, on top of the $11.4 billion of financing the parent company injected into VinFast in 2017-2023, according to a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.. “We will never let VinFast go,” he told Vingroup shareholders at their annual general meeting in April, according to state media.. The VF3 initially will be sold in emerging markets in Asia, where car buyers graduating from motorcycles to four-wheelers might not be as finnicky as Americans, said Tu Le, the founder of the consultancy Sino Auto Insights. . Just 3.1-meters-long, and 1.6 meters wide and high (10 feet long and 5.2 feet wide and high), it can squeeze into narrow lanes in Asian cities, but still seats five people.. VinFast aims to sell 20,000 of these cars in Vietnam this year and deliveries will begin in August. It's being sold on the Southeast Asian e-commerce website Shopee, with an initial deposit of about $2,000. The company says more than 27,000 people applied to buy the car in the first three days after orders opened on May 13.. Many, like Dieu Linh, 32, are first-time car buyers. A businesswoman, she and her husband wanted to switch from motorbikes to a car, which is safer and more comfortable during extreme heat or rains. . ""The VF3 price is tempting. But I'll wait and see how it performs on the road before I make my deposit,” she said.. VinFast plans to start selling VF3s in the Philippines this year and in Indonesia, Thailand, the U.S., and Europe by next year. . It opened its first showroom in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, in April and says it has sold about 600 SUVs to Indonesian companies. It has begun construction of a factory in India. . Even in Asian markets, VinFast faces plenty of competition, especially from Chinese EV maker BYD, which has already achieved a big enough scale for cost-efficient manufacturing. Chinese EV makers like BYD and Haima are rapidly expanding in Southeast Asia. But in Vietnam, VinFast's near-monopoly over charging infrastructure — charging stations dot the country, not just in big cities but also in more remote hilly provinces — consumer mistrust of Chinese products and nationalist sentiment may give it an initial edge, said Le Hong Hiep, a visiting fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.. BYD plans to launch three models — the Atto 3, Dolphin and Seal — in Vietnam next month.. VinFast must increase its sales to reduce per unit costs for its sprawling factory in northern Vietnam’s Haiphong province, which has the capacity to make around 250,000 EVs a year but is making a fraction of that. . “An idle factory just burns through money,” said Tu Le, the auto consultant.. India, the world's third-largest car market by sales, offers the promise of scale, but only if VinFast builds its own factory there to enable it to benefit from policies that protect local carmakers. High import taxes mean that even at $9,200, the VF3 would be too expensive for Indians, said Ishan Raghav, the managing editor of the Indian car magazine autoX.. The VF3 might appeal to Indian families looking for a compact car with a range suitable for getting around in India’s crowded cities. But newcomers have to set up broad sales and EV charging networks and that will take a few years, he said. “All of these — manufacturing, sales and service and charging networks — are capital intensive and take time,"" he said.. Vingroup has launched a company called V-Green to build its own charging infrastructure in Vietnam and other key markets. In Thailand, it plans to build its own charging infrastructure, Vu Dang Yen Hang, chief executive officer of VinFast Thailand, told The Associated Press in an interview in March.. VinFast is racing against time. . Despite prioritizing sales in the U.S., bad reviews for its early models in the hypercompetitive market meant that it sold fewer than 1,000 cars in North America last year and only around 35,000 cars globally, below its target of at least 40,000 cars. About two-thirds of VinFast's revenue in 2023 came from sales to a taxi service owned by Vingroup, according to a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.. VinFast's main challenge is to improve its financial performance, said Hiep. . “If they cannot sustain it long enough, they may go bankrupt,” he said.. ______.

SKOPJE, North Macedonia -- North Macedonia’s government on Tuesday announced a $500 million project with renewables investor Alcazar Energy Partners to build the largest wind farm in the landlocked country.. Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski said the project would significantly boost energy independence, as well as foreign investment.. “(It will be) the largest investment in renewable energy sources that we ever had,” Mickoski said.. The wind farm, to be located in the country’s southeast, will be one of the largest in the Western Balkans, with a capacity to generate up to 400 megawatts of renewable energy.. Construction is expected to begin in early 2026. Once operational, the wind farm is scheduled to produce enough energy to power over 100,000 households annually, while avoiding the release of more than 670,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.. A total 55 wind turbines will be installed, which are meant to provide about 20% of the country's total electricity output.. Alcazar Energy Partners said in a statement that grid connections with Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Kosovo, will help reduce energy shortages and support the transition to renewable energy in the Western Balkans.. Company managing partner Daniel Calderon said Alcazar Energy “sees North Macedonia as a promising investment location for renewable energy.”.
